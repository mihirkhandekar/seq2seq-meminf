when &apos;s the last time you really enjoyed just the voice of your friend ?
so nowadays , everyone could produce his mono product .
we &apos;ve heard about your work with the kids and the ex-steel workers , and we &apos;re inclined to want to support your desire to build a new building .
and i can now tell you with absolute certainty that an appearance on oprah winfrey will sell 10,000 cds .
and you &apos;ll see that warehouse going by .
as i said before , we are going to win this .
honestly , we went down .
so he got the right weight at birth .
when i was going out a lot to these places , i was feeling a lot of anxiety and isolation because i was in a solitary phase in my life , and i decided to title my series &quot; &quot; naked city spleen , &quot; &quot; which references charles baudelaire .
the construction began in 1837 .
now , my brother and i , we &apos;re musicians and music producers .
so think of this as a choose-your-own-adventure of an album .
now , one way to eat fewer calories is to eat less food , which is why you can lose weight on any diet if you eat less food , or if you restrict entire categories of foods .
it wasn ’ t a function of how old or how sick they were — it was mainly how much they changed , and the oldest patients improved as much as the young ones .
and so , the year 2000 , you see there .
( video ) ( music ) alan alda : he &apos;s got it , he &apos;s got it , he &apos;s got it on his head . ( music )
quite often here they still identify with a certain kind of a lottery mentality .
now , psychoanalysts know very well that people surprisingly don &apos;t have passion for knowledge but passion for ignorance .
i mean , i watch oprah mostly when i &apos;m home in spokane visiting my mother . and to my mother , oprah is a greater moral authority than the pope , which is actually saying something because she &apos;s a devout catholic .
♫ lewis carroll i &apos;m sure did alice . ♫ sweeney : what ? !
it looked more like this when it was all wrapped up — not quite so pretty .
( applause )
but it is nearly impossible for an american to get discharged their student loan debts .
i think it &apos;s a high school discount .
how much of that do you think it would take to actually build a 10-kiloton bomb ?
so , response planning in the twenty-first century is both possible and is essential .
but if we detect those earliest moments , it &apos;ll bring us that much closer to an understanding of the big bang , which brings us that much closer to asking some of the hardest , most elusive , questions .
and yet black holes may be heard even if they &apos;re not seen , and that &apos;s because they bang on space-time like a drum .
do i fear that such an artificial intelligence might threaten all of humanity ?
( laughter ) around that same time , stanley kubrick &apos;s &quot; &quot; 2001 : a space odyssey &quot; &quot; came to the theaters , and my life was forever changed .
they are in fact essential to what makes us special .
that &apos;s it . that &apos;s the quota .
is she smiling too brightly here , or did she accidentally brush up against a man there ?
all of those a &apos;s . ( laughter ) and i got ready to return the book to the drawer , when hang on , some of my other classmates had appallingly good grades too .
so that is what you get when you face reality .
it &apos;s got to reform economic policy .
but with all due respect to all the men , and the older men especially , they did not want me around .
the yemen times already has a strong reputation in yemen as an independent english language newspaper .
for example , molecular structure .
and he took me up to the temples in nikko .
on the fourth day in the water , this is how doaa probably looked on the ring with her two children .
it was a saturday morning when the call came , and they were taken by bus to a beach , hundreds of people on the beach .
everything we do is an approximation of sophistication .
we try to make meaning out of everything that happens to us .
i think there &apos;s a sense that many of us have that the great age of exploration on earth is over , that for the next generation they &apos;re going to have to go to outer space or the deepest oceans in order to find something significant to explore .
so basically we had automobiles , but we were unaware of the forms of life that make up most of the genetic information on our planet .
but there &apos;s also a certain beauty within this technology .
you may have wondered what happens if i give the robot a little push .
or if they do have our interests at heart , we worry that they don &apos;t know us well enough to figure out what they need to do in order to allow us to secure those interests .
they want to have permission to do the right thing .
my favorite pictures on this trip were of joe and roseanne .
this is carl .
soon , i started making a forest in the backyard of my own house , and this is how it looks after three years .
so we let it happen .
there &apos;s no need to do a run of thousands of millions or send that product to be injection molded in china .
this is a 3d printer .
so he &apos;ll see every aspect of the reaction : the fact that barack obama is the biggest twitterer , the fact that it came out of ted .
in fact , there are 47 members of congress who currently have twitter accounts .
( laughter ) and freud in part reflects the anatomy of the human emotion system — which is that we have both a positive and a negative system , and our negative system is extremely sensitive .
we &apos;re wired for dangers that are immediate , that are physical , that are imminent , and so our body goes into an incredible reaction where endogenous opioids come in .
i became captivated by the beauty and genius of traditional social science experiments done by jane jacobs , stanley milgram , kevin lynch .
at the university of cambridge , with colleagues , we thought about this simple experiment .
and i promise to you , this was such an important moment in my career , when i realized that the great leader believed in young people and new ideas .
to reach clinical fruition rapidly , it was obvious : i had to think about the problem differently .
just a little toy . which leads me to the next thing , which is — what have i got here ? ok . all right .
one learning process that i see is this — ( laughter ) ok . another learning process that i see is this — ( laughter ) ok . so , everybody take a deep breath in , breath out . ok .
why that brow ? &quot; &quot; i mean , it &apos;s such a powerful thing .
you should all have one in your kitchen , beside your turbochef .
( laughter ) &quot; you must get them custom made — special , humongous guitars . &quot; ( laughter )
i was thinking about my place in the universe , and about my first thought about what infinity might mean , when i was a child .
it also runs on the iphone .
mm : it starts playing immediately .
and that &apos;s the kind of thing — the investment in the young — that makes us great , allows us to contribute .
and these were somewhat noticed .
these clouds can grow so big , up to 50 miles wide and reach up to 65,000 feet into the atmosphere .
( applause )
and so , people — this is a study that i did now .
there &apos;s more mass in the microbes than the mass of our brain .
that &apos;s where we put our people in the mri machine .
i &apos;ve been carrying on here about the biology of love .
someone &apos;s put a brick through the window .
we can beat extreme poverty , starvation , aids .
it was a 200-foot diameter geodesic sphere to be suspended over the east river in new york city , in full view of the united nations .
( applause )
and i kept on getting lost .
the fact is , there &apos;s still a tremendous amount that can be offered and can be given .
over the last few years , i haven &apos;t had that much time to really think .
we &apos;ve got all that , but we &apos;ve only got 100 years to enjoy it .
we don &apos;t feel , &quot; &quot; i am touching the air , &quot; &quot; but if the breeze is a little more faster , then i can feel it .
but if we &apos;re just cutting that footprint from the whole thing and trying to analyze it , you will miss the point because the actual journey happens between those footprints , and the footprints are nothing but passing time .
there are also , i think , increasing results from the scientific study of humans that , indeed , we &apos;re not born blank slates .
( laughter ) let me give just you an example to back up that last statement .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s so important .
ca : ah . who did you make the bet with ?
so imagine if every video that we watched on the web worked like the web , completely remixable , linked to its source content , and interactive for everyone who views it .
that means it &apos;s completely remixable . it also means there &apos;s no proprietary software . all you need is a web browser .
one of the most impressive things about what some , perhaps 10 , of the speakers have been talking about is the realization , as you listen to them carefully , that they &apos;re not saying : well , this is what we should do ; this is what i would like you to do .
so , if we are to be the world &apos;s healer , every disadvantaged person in this world — including in the united states — becomes our patient .
it starts with an internal sense , an internal desire , or a need .
but when do you have pizza ?
we had a million hits in the first month and got a lot of attention for it .
you &apos;re the very first people to see this .
from the moment of birth , the baby responds most to the voice of the person who is most likely to care for it — its mother .
in other words , the mothers with post-traumatic stress syndrome had passed on a vulnerability to the condition to their children while they were still in utero .
the next great stage , which all of you are so familiar with : the massive information revolution .
someone once said that politics is , of course , &quot; &quot; showbiz for ugly people . &quot; &quot; so , on that basis , i feel like i &apos;ve really arrived .
we have many discussions now between nih and companies about doing this that are looking very promising .
the payoff is enormous , both in terms of health and in terms of economic growth . we need to support that .
and one of the first things that i started to investigate was the history of the name of technology .
and flowers and plants are the same thing , extended , and technology is basically an extension of life .
this is a picture of me in that area taken a year before , and you can see i &apos;ve got an oxygen mask on with a rebreather .
this is what i carried up the mountain .
and our anatomists are going to go in and take a deeper look at this .
we &apos;re also selecting for brains in which we can get the tissue , we can get consent to take the tissue within 24 hours of time of death .
let &apos;s turn to now , the networked age .
these aren &apos;t just people being jerks . these are people that are saying , look , i don &apos;t want to talk to you now , or i didn &apos;t want to talk to you then , but i still care about you .
breeders there developed a rice variety carrying the sub1 gene using another genetic technique called precision breeding .
i mean , you could not spray eggplant with insecticides or not genetically engineer it , but then you &apos;d be stuck eating frass .
now there &apos;s compelling evidence that it really needs to be 350 .
if you go on the ground there , it looks like this , and this is the grandaddy coral .
now there &apos;s a difficulty with proceeding in that way , which is that christianity is extremely , even on that list , it &apos;s an extremely specific tradition .
what &apos;s going on ? how did it come about that we have this list ?
soon we will be in a position to go forth in the field with sequencers on our backs — to hunt bacteria in tiny crevices of the habitat &apos;s surface in the way you go watching for birds with binoculars .
i found my magical ants , but only after a tough climb into the mountains where the last of the native cuban forests hung on , and were then — and still are — being cut back .
we hire military and test pilots to do the maneuvering .
and out of that field campaign we &apos;ll probably get a few dozen papers on a few dozen processes or molecules .
the data points that are closer together have microbial communities that are more similar than data points that are far apart .
so all of you right now are sharing your microbes with one another .
so how can we find a method that will harness this ?
you open your ears . you open your nose .
and remember , the vote is encrypted from the moment you leave the voting booth , so if an election official wants to find out how you voted , they will not be able to .
well in the face of all these bad headlines , researchers have taken a step back and thought about how we can do elections differently .
the big mountains far away , they move less .
negotiable meaning that it makes a difference whether you do something or not .
we do love a good baseline .
in fact , it could save countless lives .
we see the pulse and the seasonal activities that these animals are going on .
now in a second project called tagging of pacific pelagics , we took on the planet as a team , those of us in the census of marine life .
wrestling with unfamiliar ideas can help clarify your own thinking .
and i hope many more people will join me .
but we don &apos;t just experience them , we show them .
i think , in fact , that if we realized how valuable social networks are , we &apos;d spend a lot more time nourishing them and sustaining them , because i think social networks are fundamentally related to goodness .
the odd one out is an astronomer , and i am one of that strange breed .
we &apos;ve been familiar for 40 years with this image : the fragile beauty of land , ocean and clouds , contrasted with the sterile moonscape on which the astronauts left their footprints .
make your best guess .
it falls out of the air , lands right back in the hand .
he wrote a list of what the phonograph might be good for when he invented it , and kind of only one of his ideas turned out to have been the right early idea .
( video ) john markoff : do you want to know what the counterculture in drugs , sex , rock &apos; n &apos; roll and the anti-war movement had to do with computing ? everything .
and you can imagine what that would be like , right , in your own life — and i know this is true of some of you — if you were drinking all day , and then you switched from a depressant to a stimulant in your life , you would have better ideas .
and before long , they think , &quot; &quot; well jeez , this is kind of historic .
now , mathematicians have been hiding and writing messages in the genetic code for a long time , but it &apos;s clear they were mathematicians and not biologists because , if you write long messages with the code that the mathematicians developed , it would more than likely lead to new proteins being synthesized with unknown functions .
the second quotation is , &quot; &quot; see things not as they are , but as they might be . &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a quote from the &quot; &quot; american prometheus &quot; &quot; book on robert oppenheimer .
what if i could aim sound the way i aim light ?
( laughter ) i was seeing if you were listening .
pen . pen . pen .
what ?
my default mode is no longer to be a rush-aholic .
because people at the top of the chain , people like you , i think , are starting to realize that there &apos;s too much speed in the system , there &apos;s too much busyness , and it &apos;s time to find , or get back to that lost art of shifting gears .
perhaps there &apos;s still hope ahead .
and during terence &apos;s illness , i , we , we wanted to believe the story of our fight together too .
well , some are , and a few are really at the vanguard .
now clearly , these are environmental and social issues , but that &apos;s not all .
as gandhi said , &quot; to a hungry man , a piece of bread is the face of god . &quot;
and we find that if we keep girls in school later , they &apos;ll stay in school until they &apos;re 16 , and won &apos;t get married if there &apos;s food in school .
so in the early &apos; 80s , there was a ban on commercial whaling that came into force as a result of this campaign .
as these carcasses sink , they provide a feast to some 400-odd species , including the eel-shaped , slime-producing hagfish .
but why should we care how smart materials work and what they are made of ?
secondly , and just as important , innovation has always been fueled by tinkerers .
the eames &apos; film tops , lower left .
at the same time that charles was doing that chair , he was doing this film .
the bad news was that everyone liked howard .
women do not negotiate for themselves in the workforce .
that &apos;s the question .
but most important in this , the exponent , the analog to that three-quarters for the metabolic rate , is bigger than one — it &apos;s about 1.15 to 1.2 .
( laughter ) in the long run , of course , it would also make it possible for us to move out there .
they look like , maybe like sunflowers .
it never makes a mistake . because if you make a mistake , you don &apos;t leave any progeny .
our school systems are very flawed and do not reward you for the things that are important in life or for the survival of civilization ; they reward you for a lot of learning and sopping up stuff .
( laughter ) you probably think the electrons in an electric wire move instantaneously down a wire , don &apos;t you , at the speed of light when you turn the light on . they don &apos;t .
( laughter ) &quot; &quot; i &apos;ve misjudged this women , &quot; &quot; thought mr. dickens .
so from this perspective , having blogs and wikis produce knowledge has been great .
within days the entire incident was forgotten , which would have never happened if they simply tried to block the content .
my sweet angels , come back . &quot; &quot; medea she was , next time i saw her .
the display was a photo . men and women stripped naked , some trying to cover their genitals , others too frightened to bother , lined up in snow waiting to be shot and thrown into a ditch .
i need to know that this week .
but here &apos;s the problem with testing .
the picture behind me was snapped by the copilot in our chase aircraft just moments after the wheels got off the ground for the first time .
radio : it actually flew . yes .
tell us why your science is relevant to us .
don &apos;t just tell me that you study trabeculae , but tell me that you study trabeculae , which is the mesh-like structure of our bones because it &apos;s important to understanding and treating osteoporosis .
what are things that you get from the universe that you can &apos;t really explain ?
that was an essay i wrote when i was 11 years old and i got a b + . ( laughter ) what i &apos;m going to talk about : nothing out of something , and how we create .
and isn &apos;t it a little strange that he required no payment for this ?
( laughter ) now , i am not a scientist .
so the recipe is simple : you take the silk solution , you pour it , and you wait for the protein to self-assemble .
they find their way to self-assemble .
and if i want to control him , i can just drive .
if i duck down , he &apos;ll follow me .
out of all the care i &apos;ve had in hospitals and clinics around the world , the first time i &apos;ve ever had a true team-based care experience was at legacy good sam these last six months for me to go get this .
and the magic here is , experiment on my avatar in software , not my body in suffering .
let me tease you with a very recent analysis .
there was no responsibility .
but people were waiting in long queues under sun and under rain in order to get a certificate or just a simple answer from two tiny windows of two metal kiosks .
it &apos;s also about environment and respect .
and they share this great splendor with a very large pig .
the entire center was filled with girls like her .
( laughter ) we swiss are famous for chocolate and cheese . our trains run on time .
i mean , you see , everything seems to have been scattered aimlessly around the space .
we should use machines that bring our work back into the world .
you &apos;re hunched over these rectangles , fumbling with buttons and menus and more rectangles .
and when they finally hand you heartache , when they slip war and hatred under your door and offer you handouts on street-corners of cynicism and defeat , you tell them that they really ought to meet your mother .
my knees still buckle every time i get on a stage .
and it &apos;s a made-up word .
that &apos;s the first time i &apos;ve ever played it .
it actually is a japanese beetle .
now , you might be asking yourself , &quot; well , you know , what would i do in a biolab ? &quot;
and the tubing coming out of my chest was a nightmare for costume designers .
( laughter ) my father and my grandfather were always looking for the newest thing in alternative or traditional therapies for ph , but after six months , i couldn &apos;t walk up a small hill . i couldn &apos;t climb a flight of stairs .
but help was coming .
nobel prize nominee hernando de soto recognized that the key to economic liftoff for most developing countries is to tap the vast amounts of uncapitalized land .
same thing happened with the mouflon , where it &apos;s an endangered species of sheep .
pretty soon , the computer learned , by reading the monkey &apos;s brainwaves , to make that arm in the other room do whatever the monkey &apos;s arm did .
finally , big problems sometimes elude solution because we don &apos;t really understand the problem .
today , less than two percent of the world &apos;s energy consumption derives from advanced , renewable sources such as solar , wind and biofuels , less than two percent , and the reason is purely economic .
so i would need a piano to practice on , and an hour later i would be at a fan &apos;s house .
it was consistent .
bf : sure .
( laughter ) bf : no , come stay up with him .
he needs a guaranteed success , and so what he does is , he holds a competition .
i &apos;ll have it out later for tech demos .
does any of this matter ?
we call this the &quot; &quot; end of history &quot; &quot; illusion .
there &apos;s no touchscreen .
maybe this is the computer of the future .
the pool expanded a little bit if we ignored one intracellular parasite ; it expanded even more when we looked at core sets of genes of around 310 or so .
just on the data collection side , just where we are through the galapagos , we &apos;re finding that almost every 200 miles , we see tremendous diversity in the samples in the ocean .
and biodiversity is an indicator of how much water can be balanced , how many medicines can be kept here .
if the group doesn &apos;t take action , the other 33 groups have to decide what is going to happen to the group that doesn &apos;t comply with those great deals that we are offering them .
and eventually we got two large animals , and pig studies .
in the last decade there &apos;s been an explosion of use of bone marrow stem cells to treat the patient &apos;s other diseases such as heart disease , vascular disease , orthopedics , tissue engineering , even in neurology to treat parkinson &apos;s and diabetes .
they &apos;re sitting in a room with potato chips in front of them .
it turns out that , in fact , the world was given this gift in 1738 by a dutch polymath named daniel bernoulli .
i had to write five pages a day towards papers or i would have to give up five dollars .
( laughter ) such it is with commitment devices .
well , there is still a lot to explore in its early days . and there &apos;s not many people working in this field .
we &apos;ve seen that it can affect matter and cause form within matter .
something deliberate , something secret , and who got the four in the morning bad rap ball rolling anyway ?
hs : wait , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait — let me see if i got this straight .
he knows exactly what the problem is , and he knows exactly how to deal with it , and the dance is this transition behavior that allows them to reorientate themselves .
one was hot , one was cold .
( applause )
so low numbers mean that people worked harder .
( laughter ) i &apos;m used to a stationary mic .
the answer was the most low-tech thing you can imagine .
we &apos;re very , very early . thank you very much .
now , the toaster was huge because they used to make toast on open fires , and it took a lot of time and attention .
so we &apos;re seeing financial reward being used to tackle the great issue of obesity .
you say , it &apos;s about doing 10 of these questions , but another task is turning up to 20 classes on time , but another task is collaborating with other people , another task is showing you &apos;re working five times , another task is hitting this particular target .
because this misunderstood and underfunded &quot; &quot; rare &quot; &quot; disease , they just sat and watched people saying it over and over : &quot; &quot; als , als . &quot; &quot; it was unbelievable .
goal number one , check .
we &apos;ve developed this ability because it makes evolutionary sense .
if you don &apos;t understand the risks , you don &apos;t understand the costs , you &apos;re likely to get the trade-off wrong , and your feeling doesn &apos;t match reality .
so you can change a letter , you can take letters out , but most importantly , you can stuff new dna in , kind of like a trojan horse .
we all have a responsibility .
why on earth are you making chocolate pudding ?
she &apos;s a polish poet .
and we think this is the first time that a program and transformation has been embedded directly into the materials themselves .
and i don &apos;t mean automated machines .
it won &apos;t cost us any more to do it the right way . &quot; &quot; and they redid that building .
the general hospital right next door emerged largely unscathed .
in india , we have these huge families .
i bet a lot of you all must have heard about it .
and so let me list just a couple of the things i think this research points us toward trying to understand .
a second skill is equipoise , the ability to have the serenity to read the biases and failures in your own mind .
and that &apos;s what i wanted from them more than anything else .
he spelled moriarty with only one &apos; i &apos; .
i invited our new ceo , and as soon as he realized we had a room packed full of laughing infidels , his reaction was very simple : &quot; &quot; let &apos;s make this happen .
i moved to dubai as the head of original content for a western tv network .
but i &apos;ll give you a hint why this is happening .
my phone is a slot machine .
and so what you see in all three of these places , in honolulu and in oakland and in mexico city , are the elements that are at the core of civic hacking .
we are pleased to announce today that we &apos;re opening up the brigade to international cities for the first time , starting with cities in poland and japan and ireland .
( applause )
we &apos;re going to rebuild your knee with the parts .
and nevertheless that many people on the left try to hate it , the truth is that it was very much the market revolution that sent the message : &quot; the government does not know better . &quot;
( applause )
all screens look into the one . no bits will live outside the web .
everything we &apos;ve described , every artifact or place , will be a specific representation , will have a specific character that can be linked to directly .
and rather than send it , i decided to read it to them in person .
you nearly fall with one leg , then you catch yourself with the other .
they &apos;re in the crowd , and the crowd is switching on lights , and we can see them for the first time , not as an undifferentiated mass of strangers , but as individuals we can learn from .
video is high-bandwidth for a reason .
but the romans developed salting .
the cold colors , the blue and the black , show areas where we have almost no data .
so let me remind you .
one consequence of that , by the way , is that the phone never broke .
now we can take away this — and i would like to show you the rate of speed , the rate of change , how fast they have gone .
and china was emitting 0.6 , and india was emitting 0.32 tons per capita .
( applause )
this is a farmer in our program , consolata .
lightning lit the sky , and a baby was born .
mt : nikola tesla died on the 7th of january , 1943 .
a tremendous amount of energy is coming at us from the sun .
we &apos;re simply not going to do that .
it &apos;s not ; it &apos;s a wonderful place full of incredible energy and intelligence .
if the al-qaeda base was to be established near ghazni , we would hit them very hard , and it would be very , very difficult for the taliban to protect them .
and they demanded authorities from — to come down from their high horses .
just see the contrast .
so anyway , let me change pace a little bit .
so my ask is this : go online , find these simple best practices , find out how to update and patch your computer .
so this graph here , i &apos;m going to show you now .
( applause )
so how might we prepare for some of these specific threats , like attacking a president or a prime minister ?
technology has made our world increasingly open , and for the most part , that &apos;s great , but all of this openness may have unintended consequences .
it undercuts self-righteousness , radically alters the tone and character of controversy , and enriches dramatically the possibilities for finding common ground .
the accomplishment of civic virtue is tied to the uses of intellect and imagination at their most challenging .
one of the things we asked them recently was what &apos;s their top issue .
we &apos;ve not called the bill gates , and the soros , and everybody else who is helping and say , &quot; &quot; sit down . let &apos;s have a conference with you .
we met her on our first family vacation .
anybody check that today ?
does kind of convey the sense that this is an integrated system .
it was before hamas had won the palestinian election , eliciting various counter-measures by israel .
we think this boat is going to phuket hospital , but if it &apos;s too dangerous to land at its pier , then perhaps it will go to krabi instead , which is more protected .
voice 1 : it &apos;s coming again . voice 2 : new wave ?
it &apos;s a static image . how many people see this illusion ? it &apos;s completely static .
and figure goes to ground .
that &apos;s right , the fbi is paying mostly criminals and con men six figures to spy on communities in the united states , but mostly muslim american communities .
after 9 / 11 , the fbi was given an edict : never again .
and what is it that &apos;s missing ?
and then many years later , you get this truck , and so you have google maps .
rg + av : thank you .
and i think , with a death , you have a funeral , you celebrate the life , and there &apos;s a lot of community support , and it &apos;s something women don &apos;t have with miscarriage .
because the human thing is very hard when you &apos;re at mit .
and in 2001 , i had 26 million hits , and for &quot; &quot; computer , &quot; &quot; because computers are against humans a bit , i have 42 million hits . let me do an al gore here .
you know , i &apos;m making a very important argument .
but you know , i have a problem with children &apos;s books : i think they &apos;re full of propaganda .
this lifelong capacity for plasticity , for brain change , is powerfully expressed .
because what we &apos;ve done in our personal evolutions is build up a large repertoire of specific skills and abilities that are specific to our own individual histories .
i grew up in the south and whiled away the summers fishing .
law has to be simple enough so that people can internalize it in their daily choices .
so , that &apos;s a scenario that we think we should be capitalizing on .
mtv europe worked with us and made that spoof , and they &apos;ve been slipping it in between music videos without any introduction , which i think is kind of fun .
you can get on your kinect and you can have unicorns dancing and rainbows spraying out of your mobile phone .
because finally there was a page that actually felt like what it felt like to hit a 404 .
this may , we &apos;re going to go from minus 1,000 meters in zacaton , and if we &apos;re very lucky , depthx will bring back the first robotically-discovered division of bacteria .
and it &apos;s kind of like a high altitude mountaineering trip in reverse , except that you &apos;re now running a string of these things down .
from very primitive beginnings , with a very crude tool kit of stones , we now have a very advanced tool kit , and our tool use has really reached unprecedented levels : we &apos;ve got buggies to mars ; we &apos;ve mapped the human genome ; and recently even created synthetic life , thanks to craig venter .
just to put this in terms of generations , because people do find it hard to think of time , homo erectus left africa 90,000 generations ago .
dm : again , i would be very much about being open-minded .
for example , sending children to school , parents could earn money for that , or getting their children inoculated or immunized , parents could get paid for doing that .
you have to fight feelings of helplessness .
we were driving with friends down a dark road at night , when a police car stopped us .
here &apos;s a diagram of the pcb load of dolphins in sarasota bay .
on the left there , julia platt , the mayor of my little hometown in pacific grove .
all this still persists .
if they have the price of entry into an internet cafe — the last time i looked , it was something like a pound an hour — and if you have skype , it &apos;s free .
a writ of habeus corpus is issued .
they don &apos;t have any legal rights .
and what i &apos;ve found is that the process of designing and building electronics is problematic in all sorts of ways .
a conductive pen from the lewis lab at uiuc .
barring a handful of outliers , there are only 32 geometric signs .
it requires close contact for a message to be sent and received .
( applause ) yes , maybe just to round off .
and our main idea was to sort of sample the seven most significant mountains of the topography of azerbaijan and reinterpret them into urban and architectural structures , inhabitable of human life .
that choice is ours .
( applause )
geologists have a pretty good idea of where the oil is .
so oil is playing a less significant role every year .
we have the chance to write an entirely new polio-free chapter in human history .
the reality of polio today is something very different .
and parallel universes ? again : dots there , rather than there , on a screen .
if they &apos;d been observed in phase , the theory would have been refuted .
so here , further data that ultraviolet — that &apos;s sunlight — has benefits on the blood flow and the cardiovascular system .
so , thank you very much indeed .
it &apos;s such a large molecule we can see it with a light microscope .
a chromosome , by the way , is just a piece of inert chemical material .
( laughter ) ladies and gentlemen , meet your cousins .
it &apos;s where we learn to trust and where we learn about the rules of the game .
meaning that you have muscle cells , but they &apos;re not dividing , so it doesn &apos;t seem like a good target for cancer to hijack .
it &apos;s not harmful ; it has just repaired the muscle .
ahhhh , very good .
you hear the difference ?
even though there are default situations in which one of these mindsets can be applied , they can be stretched and extended .
the honest officer can &apos;t hold you to it as being a bribe , and therefore , you get the nuisance of the traffic ticket .
robust systems can perform multiple tasks with the same structure .
and they have nearly unlimited maneuverability with that same structure and unprecedented access to a variety of different areas .
how does light look in slow motion ?
and it &apos;s not science fiction . we have actually built it .
csp produces a lot of waste heat .
firstly , radical increases in resource efficiency .
( laughter ) it &apos;s this , and i think this is a particularly lovely solution .
this idea of the way that people cobble together solutions in our life — and the things we kind of do in our environment that are somewhat subconscious but have huge potential — is something that we look at a lot .
tribes constitute thousands of natural experiments in how to run a human society .
another reason is our american emphasis on the virtues of self-reliance and independence , so we instinctively look down on older people who are no longer self-reliant and independent .
notice that there are only some objects that he can see , whereas there are many more objects that you can see .
( laughter ) it can go on a long time . ( laughter ) one of the brain regions that changes most dramatically during adolescence is called prefrontal cortex .
and i was so nervous , because i thought he was going to be disappointed in me for abandoning our clients for some crazy idea .
they will be used to realize our aspiration &quot; &quot; ?
and i must say , i am convinced that the passport that appeared , i believe , was put by the person who has blown — bg : — himself up , yeah .
we have thousands and thousands of european fighters in syria and in iraq , so this is not something that you solve by just not allowing syrians to come in .
and of course , a few of us are saying : okay , computers !
i mean , lexicography is not rocket science .
and he comes to the town . he &apos;s a broken person .
and you begin to get very sentimental ; you cultivate sentimentality intensely .
this is visualizing international communications .
so with everybody making so much amazing stuff and actually understanding what it was they were working on , i was really interested in trying to make a collaborative project where people were working together to build something .
they are what we just said — facial features , hair structure , skin color .
and it &apos;s a lot : 38 million variable positions .
chimpanzees , gorillas , orangutans also learn human sign language .
they shoot everything , every single thing that moves that &apos;s bigger than a small rat ; they sun-dry it or smoke it .
it depends only on the mass of the object .
and that buys us about a factor of 20 .
and tribe leaders can do that .
ever-cheaper labor and ever-faster machines .
and now what she &apos;s looking at in new york are colleges , because she &apos;s determined to go to school in new york .
my story begins when i was in new york city for a speaking engagement , and my wife took this picture of me holding my daughter on her first birthday . we &apos;re on the corner of 57th and 5th .
they never get stuck in traffic . they could even go on a sidewalk .
so today , 22 years later , we have united hatzalah .
for example , he discouraged giving the diagnosis to children who had seizures but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism .
the number of diagnoses started to soar , just as lorna and judith predicted , indeed hoped , that it would , enabling autistic people and their families to finally get the support and services they deserved .
it &apos;s a stress hormone .
so when you reach out to others under stress , either to seek support or to help someone else , you release more of this hormone , your stress response becomes healthier , and you actually recover faster from stress .
all right , now for some more sound data .
and it &apos;s the combination of these things that has led me to the hobby of sound visualization , and , on occasion , has led me to play with fire .
so i was a little depressed .
you &apos;ll have no choice ; you &apos;ll buy my code .
and actually , in hot weather , i can just grow it outside .
suzanne lee . ( sl : thank you . ) ( applause )
the night before i left , she came to the room and said , &quot; &quot; leymah , don &apos;t leave me here .
so i will do this .
there &apos;s one fellow out there , van praagh is his name , james van praagh .
the professionals never come near us , except in that case of sylvia browne that i told you about a moment ago .
i told you this story because you must understand that there is a world that goes well beyond the headlines of the newspapers , including the personal relationship that you have with friends and family .
and i was one of those people .
it &apos;s not rebuilding europe , it &apos;s reversing the divergence for the bottom billion , so that they actually catch up .
now , there &apos;s one big change since the commodity booms of the 1970s , and that is the spread of democracy .
quantum biology isn &apos;t about this .
it can happen that these two protons can hop over .
many in my generation — because of well-intentioned parenting and self-esteem education — were socialized to believe that we were special little snowflakes — ( laughter ) who were going to go out and save the world .
thank you . thank you for hip-hop — and anita hill .
the paradox here is that the last decade probably was a lost decade for making progress on this .
i cannot do that unless i send the signals that i will be open to listen to the other side &apos;s signals .
and when it became a landscape , it also became a destination , and altered , really , the course of my life .
and these organisms , because they &apos;re very separate from the surface , make a vast array of novel compounds .
thank you .
so it kind of was sending a message that only girls are supposed to cook ; boys aren &apos;t .
this was a wonderful place , because it was a place where you could imagine that you were the first person to be there .
can we do it another way , using the language of particles around a nucleus , and talk about the body as an energy center ?
i &apos;m talking to you about modern-day slavery .
and one day she gives up on you and me , because we have no options for her .
he then goes to rwanda and to congo in the aftermath of the genocide , and he &apos;s the guy who has to decide — huh , ok , the genocide is over ; 800,000 people have been killed ; the people responsible are fleeing into neighboring countries — into congo , into tanzania .
but what sergio was talking about is , let &apos;s calibrate our relationship to the threat .
we are totally closed .
it &apos;s a wonderful , very craft-oriented society .
secondly , the new machine age is exponential .
you can see a little bit of a slowdown there in the mid- &apos; 70s , but it matches up pretty well with the second industrial revolution , when factories were learning how to electrify their operations .
can you be not for or against anything ?
you do find groups in the animal kingdom — you do find cooperative groups — but these groups are always either very small or they &apos;re all siblings .
i think the dalai lama should have heard that . i wish he &apos;d been there to hear that .
it is nirvana .
thank you very much .
i love finding , wearing , and more recently , photographing and blogging a different , colorful , crazy outfit for every single occasion .
communication was extremely difficult .
recent uk legislation could be used in the same way .
how could it be otherwise ?
they drink the water they know is dirty , they get cholera , they get diarrhea , they get jaundice and they die .
incidentally , they did pull it off .
now here is what happened to this person who eventually became mayor of san francisco .
thank you very much .
so here &apos;s the thing .
every 67 seconds , someone in the united states is diagnosed with alzheimer &apos;s .
people living happily and healthfully — that &apos;s the world that i imagine .
people like the persecuted palestinians .
because she was like him , and he liked her .
now the last option was the longest , and the most difficult : to sail 1,500 miles due south in hopes of reaching a certain band of winds that could eventually push them toward the coast of south america .
read in the right way , our fears are an amazing gift of the imagination , a kind of everyday clairvoyance , a way of glimpsing what might be the future when there &apos;s still time to influence how that future will play out .
these here are five different organizations that classify carcinogens .
and air quality and air pollutants have a huge impact on the lung health of asthmatic patients , anyone with a respiratory disorder and really all of us in general .
but today i want to tell you a different story .
so , not that these two issues aren &apos;t important and tragic . they are .
they don &apos;t work , we have to fix them .
that &apos;s our average budget .
polls taken , this poll was taken 10 years ago .
but those ants , even though most of them get wiped out , those ants are the ones that are essential to the survival of the hive . so exploration is important .
trust is not parceled out , as we all know .
and what you end up seeing is the whole phenomenon of the fact that we are actually stepping forth and basically leveraging future education , future children in our households .
i believe that the payoff would be very big .
did the people who ate that mastodon meat owe something to the hunters and their families ?
and i also have the hand closed and open .
i &apos;m still using that old technology with a bicycle cable on his right side .
thank you .
suddenly , i had much more than the rest of my village .
you have things like coral .
so if you look right there , it finds that little bacterium , and it engulfs it and eats it .
but there is another point .
too dark .
a couple of years ago , we had 1,750 people all together in a square in wageningen town , and they ate insects at the same moment , and this was still big , big news .
well we know that that was not a cheap war .
knowing that you &apos;re not top dog is a welcomed discomfort , i think .
the swamp will change you , i promise .
and i &apos;d like to review just how unintended consequences play the part that they do .
we need to learn from those figures that i mentioned .
they &apos;ve been killed on the street .
they have been suffocated to death .
but if you can take this big , massive thing , and you could turn it into a million little things — something like a flock of birds — well then the radar that &apos;s looking for that has to be able to see every flock of birds in the sky .
( applause )
and i will go you one further .
in the 19th century , it was a corrupt politician .
t : i want to speak perfect english !
s ( yelling more loudly ) : i want to change my life !
the fourth and final lesson we &apos;ve learned is about the potential of radical innovation .
in fact , i &apos;m certain california &apos;s not enough .
he didn &apos;t know about the big bang . he didn &apos;t know about the expansion of the universe .
so boltzmann says , we will only live in the part of the multiverse , in the part of this infinitely big set of fluctuating particles , where life is possible .
( applause ) dan won his prize in medicine for demonstrating that high-priced fake medicine works better than low-priced fake medicine .
that &apos;s on june 5 every year .
it &apos;s called the basket cell .
and what you see here is a mouse trying to solve a maze .
it &apos;s true that i had teachers that didn &apos;t give up on me , and i was very fortunate to have those teachers , because i often gave them cause to think there was no reason to invest in me .
and like all authors dream of doing , i promptly quit my job .
but her tribe and family urged her not to compete and were very much against it .
well , you probably recognize the first person .
and i &apos;m sure people in this crowd can probably find the solutions to these .
dr. v : see , mcdonald &apos;s &apos; concept is simple .
so 60 seconds was how long it took for the physical earthquake to travel .
so that &apos;s , every second , more than an hour of video gets uploaded .
( applause )
it &apos;s now 2.7 degrees .
cool thing number two , you can grow any type of tissue out of them : brain , heart , liver , you get the picture , but out of your cells .
you go from drug formulation , lab testing , animal testing , and then clinical trials , which you might call human testing , before the drugs get to market .
he &apos;s nonverbal . he can &apos;t talk at all .
i &apos;ve got to rock backwards and forwards , or sometimes scream .
right now , america is in an unremitting state of trauma .
that &apos;s why we grow homes . thanks very much .
and we took the money that we made from our farmer &apos;s market , and started buying gifts for the homeless and for needy around the world .
model good behavior . get them to a green cart .
( laughter ) now astrology — we remove the banal idea that your life could be predicted ; that you &apos;ll , perhaps today , meet a lucky man who &apos;s wearing a hat .
you , i imagine , can do much better things with your time .
a new leader was elected in argentina .
he pasted tarps over the windows of his home to prevent prying eyes during the long icelandic winter .
diving day and night was really easy for me in 1970 , when i led a team of aquanauts living underwater for weeks at a time — at the same time that astronauts were putting their footprints on the moon .
they flash , and sparkle , and glow with their own living light .
now , ballet requires an extraordinary level of expertise and a high level of skill , and probably a level of initial suitability that may well have a genetic component to it .
so , well , i do applied math , and this is a peculiar problem for anyone who does applied math , is that we are like management consultants .
and in fact , this car has driven over a million miles without any accidents on regular roads .
we have seen this once before , of course .
so , again , transformation , adaptation , is our greatest human skill .
there &apos;s no normal .
in the curved part there &apos;s all the mechanical equipment .
this beautiful object , the swiss army knife , which i get credit for participating in .
this is a summer monsoon .
and that front in the middle is not vertical , it &apos;s at an angle .
they were eating the same food .
i am standing here today and declaring that we can end child marriage in a generation .
( laughter ) fn : and i brought this all together , this passion with alternative energy and raced a solar car across australia — also the u.s. and japan .
it goes 150 miles an hour .
what &apos;s that time worth ?
that intersection i looked at had about 3,000 cars per day in each direction , and so that &apos;s two ounces of gas to accelerate out of .
working to help the villagers obtain fresh water from wells .
empowering women , working with education , providing scholarships for girls so they can finish secondary school , in the clear understanding that , all around the world , as women &apos;s education improves , family size drops .
and we are very close to my house .
which is bogota , and they did a very good job .
it &apos;s not an elegant universe . ( laughter ) and then there &apos;s the best of all possible worlds in an ethical sense .
there &apos;s also just the crummy , generic realities that aren &apos;t special in any way , that are sort of random .
so scientists care whether evidence is randomly sampled or not , but what does that have to do with babies ?
let &apos;s see what the baby does .
the company was brilliant .
but companies can &apos;t choose .
so , we have a supervillain with incredible superpowers .
they &apos;re clever , they &apos;re adaptable , and they &apos;re very good at staying alive .
somebody who &apos;s working for you , or a partner , or even yourself .
thank you . i have to tell you i &apos;m both challenged and excited .
i &apos;m back here on the ted stage again .
i was caught off guard when stephen colbert asked me a profound question , a profound question .
one must stay away . i &apos;m god , or i used to be . &apos; &quot; &quot; at that point in the text , where i said &quot; &quot; i &apos;m god , or i used to be , &quot; &quot; my husband made a marginal note .
there &apos;s nothing benign about it .
true symbiosis .
basically , we get it out of mines .
it &apos;s something like my accident , right ?
but ever since then , the wheelchair has been a given in my life .
in the 20th century , we came up with this idea of management .
and here &apos;s the best part .
and then movies , via cd-rom . it was amazing .
and also &quot; &quot; no love . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) so that is authoritarianism .
but we began to think , maybe we should look all over the world .
but today , i want us to step back and ask a more fundamental question , and ask , &quot; &quot; what happens if we &apos;re thinking about this maybe in the wrong context ? &quot; &quot; we do a lot of studying of those who are sick and building up long lists of altered components .
i would like to leave you with one thought , which is for me , the dominant theme of this gathering , and is the dominant theme of this way of thinking about the world .
they &apos;re careerists , they also care about getting credit — there &apos;s ego involvement , they want to be seen as important in shaping the outcome , or as important , if it &apos;s their druthers , to block an outcome .
&quot; &quot; oh god , i &apos;m in such trouble . i &apos;ve got children to feed .
ah , what a wonderful smell . &quot; &quot; he goes to the ark . he opens the ark .
i believe this has to be done with a new kind of user interface , and this new kind of user interface could be done with an expenditure of about 100 million dollars .
student 4l : &#91; i decided to &#93; do the shot put and the sponge ball because they &apos;re two totally different weights , and if you drop them at the same time , maybe they &apos;ll drop at the same speed .
so you &apos;re seeing the edge of the earth .
what we see here are satellites around the earth and the earth in proper registration against the universe , as we see .
without iraq balancing iran , iran could now become a threat , some in israel argued .
some believe or say that it &apos;s 1938 , iran is germany , and ahmadinejad is hitler .
whipcar , which started april of last year , it took them six months to get 1,000 cars in the service .
they made a lot of mistakes .
and so we might even speak of the stream of consciousness .
the connectome is where nature meets nurture .
where should human genius direct itself ?
same questions : how many of you think you would be able to survive for a few days ?
the largest individuals of this species , the dreadnoughts of their kind , live just on the north coast of california , where the rain is really intense .
after three books on this , it got to be a bit much , in a way .
and part of that activity is honesty .
it &apos;s not that it guarantees peace with itself or with its neighbors .
meanwhile , back in new york , no one told carl norden that his bombsight was used over hiroshima .
the bombsights that were available were incredibly crude .
i believe that they can get human beings into mars orbit by 2035 .
some of you will end up working on projects on mars , and i guarantee that some of your children will end up living there .
so we &apos;re getting the dynamics out of the body as well .
so this is something that we &apos;ve been working on .
and on guitar is my 14-year-old brother , tommy .
we &apos;re three brothers from new jersey , and the funny thing is that , believe it or not , we are hooked on bluegrass and we &apos;re excited to play it for you tonight .
we &apos;re emulating all the major facial expressions , and then controlling it with the software that we call the character engine .
i developed a series of technologies that allowed the robots to make more realistic facial expressions than previously achieved , on lower power , which enabled the walking biped robots , the first androids .
farrar , straus and giroux was like my mega-dream press .
memory was the only prize i allowed myself .
and suddenly i was on the phone to my stockbroker and my real estate agent , when i should have been talking to my clients .
so i went back to doing the projects i loved .
the truth and reconciliation process started by elevating the voices of the unheard .
extra money to pay for bills when a husband &apos;s work hours were cut .
then she said , &quot; &quot; choose your facts and biases and create an image of your own story of dignity . &quot; &quot; history as an imaging tool ?
you know , my grandfather died many years ago when i was little , but his love for mae west lives on as a misspelling in the dna of his progeny .
a 2013 deloitte study found that a surprisingly large number of people hide aspects of their identity .
i had always assumed i was immune to needing acceptance .
so , that was done .
and then before getting a loan , you must be trained .
it &apos;s threatening the very underpinnings of our society .
i &apos;m not against progress .
i &apos;ll give you two different ways to think about this problem that are the beginning of my thinking about how to think about it .
because we have no way to agree about where to set the knobs .
africa was gripped by poverty , disease and war .
when they were released , we left and we went as refugees to kenya and tanzania .
it takes about an hour and a half to two hours , depending on where it &apos;s done , under general anesthesia .
music is just one of the strangest things that there is .
now , i should mention that nathaniel refuses treatment because when he was treated it was with shock therapy and thorazine and handcuffs , and that scar has stayed with him for his entire life .
the redemptive power of music brought him back into a family of musicians that understood him , that recognized his talents and respected him .
and it anchors itself in the sand by blowing up a balloon on the end of its stock .
( laughter ) so there &apos;s a language of light in the deep ocean , and we &apos;re just beginning to understand it , and one way we &apos;re going about that is we &apos;re imitating a lot of these displays .
prisons , of course , are where people who break our laws are stuck , confined behind bars .
they &apos;re kept in bare cells like this for 23 hours a day .
&#91; external funding for science &#93; up to the 19th century , natural philosophers were expected to pay for their own equipment and supplies .
john herschel mapped the stars of the southern hemisphere , and , in his spare time , co-invented photography .
now , look — i &apos;m extremely sympathetic to their point of view .
there are terrorists and other serious national security threats that i suspect we all want the fbi and the nsa to monitor .
it is a major economic force and we need to take it very , very seriously .
they even affect the food that we eat and our governments .
fifteen seconds were sufficient to have the two groups disclose the same amount of information , as if the second group now no longer cares for faculty reading their answers .
in another experiment , we presented to our subjects information about a potential job candidate .
in fact , the infectious agent of disease in this cancer is something altogether more sinister , and something that we hadn &apos;t really thought of before .
the vet diagnosed this as transmissible venereal tumor , a sexually transmitted cancer that affects dogs .
it &apos;s cold — freezing cold .
you &apos;re alone .
don &apos;t get too attached to him .
but what a lot of people don &apos;t know is that viruses can also make bacteria sick . &quot; &quot; now , the story that i start telling my kids , it starts out like a horror story .
all these traits you can find in young kids , and you can help nurture them .
if i couldn &apos;t sell all four , i could at least get one .
some individual services even bring it down by 90 percent .
we certainly need one to succeed .
at this level of the labor market , what you need is a marketplace for spare hours .
show us everyone who &apos;s available .
i love the science fiction movies .
but carbon dioxide is carbon dioxide .
we have to recognize that real faith has no easy answers .
i can hardly say i believe it .
really what i &apos;m talking about here is trying to create a kind of artificial life .
rather , they &apos;d be a real complex mixture of all kinds of stuff , because uncontrolled chemical reactions produce a diverse mixture of organic compounds .
and that hospital could have afforded flashlights .
an american friend of mine this year volunteered as a nurse in ghana , and in a period of three months she came to a conclusion about the state of leadership in africa that had taken me over a decade to reach .
so i &apos;ll just add a couple more . blink . blink .
and their own personalities come out in totally unique ways .
it &apos;s very tough . it &apos;s very tough .
so which means that it &apos;s really impossible to find an object where you find about 10 times more sulfur than silicon , five times more calcium than oxygen . it &apos;s just impossible .
he is an actor playing the part of a magician .
he said that magicians deliberately exploit the way their audiences think .
ma : pretty big .
and none of this pin stuff would have happened if it hadn &apos;t been for saddam hussein .
so in a very typical , silly designer fashion , after years worth of work , pretty much all i have to show for it are the titles for the film .
and if paula decides should she marry joe or jack , somehow paul sounds the most interesting .
i &apos;m not a fan of peta , but i think this is a great ad .
the white picket fence , the perfect house .
they cannot be consciously contracted , especially if you overdid the botox .
here &apos;s koko with her kitten .
( applause )
jy : to better understand how this biodegradation works , we wanted to verify the catabolic pathways of our three strains .
somehow they agreed to punish only me , and the punishment was purification .
it was total nonsense , and i refused to accept that punishment .
probably because they had all the fun and i didn &apos;t , you know .
well , this project , deep blue , put me in contact with my team in a way that i never expected , and i want to pass it on to you , because i want you to reflect on this , perhaps in your own relationships .
now you know the lists i &apos;m talking about .
we added a new central park , 70 acres in size , to be right downtown in oklahoma city .
and i am convinced .
that is the torah and everything else is only commentary . &quot; &quot; and the rabbis and the early fathers of the church who said that any interpretation of scripture that bred hatred and disdain was illegitimate .
a few years ago , a university student asked me , &quot; what is the greatest surprise in your life ? &quot;
yet david again and again said that he would turn to god .
true navigation begins in the human heart .
we will not be there .
to find this out , i looked at three things : i looked at the topic that you should choose , i looked at how you should deliver it and the visuals onstage .
then , you should be brief . ( laughter ) but other than that , talk until they drag you off the stage . ( laughter )
go a couple generations forward to where we are , though , and it looks like a completely different world .
and so he asked the question , &quot; &quot; how many did we do ? &quot; &quot; and he wanted to get the data .
i suggest the house .
in this last year i have found these subsequent systems which allow for the mathematic possibilities of the calabi-yau manifolds in a way that doesn &apos;t necessitate these little hidden dimensions .
that &apos;s another killer app .
and he said it such a long time ago .
in australia they did it — this research company , called symbiotica .
if you think about your life today , you go every day through many different scales , many different changes of rhythm and pace .
this contradiction is the most pressing problem in fundamental physics , and in the next few years , we may find out whether we &apos;ll ever be able to solve it .
the universe is getting bigger and bigger faster and faster driven by a mysterious repulsive force called dark energy .
hi . i &apos;m here to talk to you about the importance of praise , admiration and thank you , and having it be specific and genuine .
but then , they hear from all the family and friends that the father told everybody else that he was proud of him , but he never told the son .
we investigate materials and technologies that have unexpected properties . over the last three years , we found over 200 of these things , and so we looked back into our library and selected six we thought would be most surprising for ted .
it comes from a company in japan called geltech . now go ahead and open it up .
&quot; well , dad , i need help . can you support me to go to america ? &quot;
and i sat down , and i opened my legs .
i can consider it is actually a log book which is representative of many journeys of that period .
can i add a slider on top of google maps and just change the year , seeing how it was 100 years before , 1,000 years before ?
it &apos;s basically efficient brainstorming , and when i visited david to learn about his research , he used dancers to explain it to me rather than the usual method : powerpoint .
the control of a laser is so precise that you can perform surgery inside of an eye , you can use it to store massive amounts of data , and you can use it for this beautiful experiment that my friend was struggling to explain .
the day after , i came back and they were already scratched .
so the reactions in the street were kind of interesting .
and the idea is that everything is defined .
and i want to talk about three stages in that evolution .
these are complaints choirs .
i trained briefly as a buddhist monk under this guy .
when it comes to engagement , the data is very clear .
and this is complexo do alemão .
so , i hope i can really accomplish that .
this solution has been called , by some , &quot; &quot; potentially the most important medical advance this century . &quot; &quot; now , the solution turned out to be simple .
could galileo be right ?
we don &apos;t construct the whole world at once .
we can also engineer these systems , so they can integrate energy sources , and can have wireless transmission capabilities .
what happens when she &apos;s home ?
the second reason is that when people do get interested in it , as i think they should , they tend to say the most appalling things .
it consciously seems like there &apos;s — i like the french &quot; &quot; arc-en-ciel &quot; &quot; — it seems like there &apos;s an arch in the sky , or it seems like the sun is setting over the mountains .
caffeine , for example , works much better with extroverts than it does introverts .
and michael almost brought the project to a crashing halt .
he simply laid there , and as i looked into his eyes , i saw inner peace and acceptance .
as i prepared myself and my equipment for his imminent cardiac arrest , i began to tell the patient of his imminent demise .
well , each of us consists of about 10 trillion human cells , but we harbor as many as 100 trillion microbial cells .
i &apos;ll just rewind that for you .
so where we see an unquestionable reality , death as an irrefutable biological condition , torajans see the expired corporeal form as part of a larger social genesis .
and here you can see these wooden effigies of the ancestors , so these are people who have already been buried , already had a funeral ceremony .
( laughter ) we want to have some people , who really know how to do this , perform human engineering studies to develop the optimum design for the portable device for treating migraine headaches .
and finally he says , &quot; &quot; ok , now i &apos;m going to — &quot; &quot; all of the aura get erased with an appropriately placed magnetic pulse .
i actually have no idea what my robot is going to do today .
the other guy whips out his cell phone and calls 911 .
the bear is a helpless victim tied to a tree , and the president of the united states decided to show it some mercy .
the line between conservation and domestication is blurred .
if you were going to take an airplane trip across the u.s. , you would be flying at these altitudes .
i can &apos;t show you all the beautiful pictures that we &apos;ve taken in the last two and a half years , because i simply don &apos;t have the time .
and this particular one is about cigarette addiction .
and if we can find that , then we &apos;ll be able to find , within each one of us , what it is that we need to find to face the big question , which is : how do we change ?
and the ants that are waiting just inside the nest entrance to decide whether to go out on their next trip , are contacting the ants coming in .
and by doing this i know how old they all are .
so we &apos;re going to need to be careful and take big data and adjust it for our needs , our very human needs .
more data . more .
the first thing the american missionary gave me was a candy .
i &apos;m leaving america .
it turned transactions into interactions , and generosity into a currency .
is there anything companies can do to make their employees feel less pressed for time ? yes .
so he stayed awake for days .
and eventually , we found our photobombing kaupichphys eel .
the toy seller , in this case , had syringes , which they usually do , next door to the diggers , which is obviously what you would expect .
and these are used with traces of blood visible .
thank you .
well obviously this is a replica .
if you &apos;re thinking about the world of education or urban education in particular , these guys will probably cancel each other out , and then we &apos;ll be okay . &quot; &quot; the reality is , the folks i described as the master teachers , the master narrative builders , the master storytellers are far removed from classrooms .
who here has been to a black church ?
you know , questions and curiosity like maddie &apos;s are magnets that draw us towards our teachers , and they transcend all technology or buzzwords in education .
rule number two : embrace the mess .
word up , l-dog .
don &apos;t forget to subtract the one .
well , no truncal ataxia , that &apos;s good.first doctor : you feeling light-headed or dizzy at all ?
playing with the world , and our perception of it , really is the essence of visual effects .
he had been there and watched it go off .
it &apos;s a very frightening , very , very frightening thought .
that makes me bow down to any woman in front of me to give full respect . that five days i &apos;ll never forget — the messy days , the lousy days , that wetness .
it makes me to stand here , the fame , the money i got out of it .
you can see there that that particular amputee , he had wrapped bandages around the knee .
it &apos;s a polycentric knee , and all that that means is the mechanism , is a four-bar mechanism , that mimics a natural human knee .
and usually , in norway , dead people are identified quickly .
it was clearly the remains of a human being .
( applause )
they &apos;re supposed to be used for the benefit of the people in the country .
well , as it turns out , this worked pretty well .
who are all of the other women on these dating sites ?
and if the answer is no , be very suspicious .
we clearly need to change it .
he literally had nothing . he was a virtual skeleton , yet he could still summon the courage and the will to move .
a hospital in zambia .
we see all this complexity .
but it &apos;s going to work . it &apos;s more effective than just computational aids .
babbage , of course , wanted to use proven technology , so steam and things .
rather than just being a programmer , she saw something that babbage didn &apos;t .
half of new jobs are never posted , so reaching out to your neighbor &apos;s boss is how you get that unposted job .
i want to change what twentysomethings are doing and thinking .
so let &apos;s switch gears and look at a really complex problem courtesy of the u.s. government .
first is the simple power of good visualization tools to help untangle complexity and just encourage you to ask questions you didn &apos;t think of before .
but neither of my parents knew this was happening .
( applause )
now , the island of mauritius is a small island off the east coast of madagascar in the indian ocean , and it is the place where the dodo bird was discovered and extinguished , all within about 150 years .
i &apos;d bought a replica , a really crappy replica , of the maltese falcon on ebay , and had downloaded enough pictures to actually have some reasonable reference .
and even just a couple of these would be enough to transform the human condition .
and it &apos;s really difficult to recall , in a normal frame of mind , just how good life can be at its best .
congestion is a huge problem .
could we do the same for transportation ?
the powder is still sugar , but what &apos;s different is what grace thinks .
and even in adulthood , differences in this brain region can explain differences among adults in how we think about and judge other people .
maybe , to really be happy , we need to stay completely immersed and focused on our experience in the moment .
we live longer . we have access to technology that would have seemed like science fiction just a few years ago .
why would they care ?
they know where they are all the time .
how do you get from trauma to growth ?
i wanted to understand the phenomenon better , so i devoured the scientific literature , and here &apos;s what i learned .
and andy and his team discovered that they were going to spend 200 million of those dollars on asphalt to surround the schools themselves .
working-class and poor urban americans are not benefiting economically from our current food system .
i will not let silence wrap itself around my indecision .
every day , all around us , we see the consequences of silence manifest themselves in the form of discrimination , violence , genocide and war .
so , what we are trying to do in our exploration is effectively write the book of how things have came about as they are today .
and that will be basically built over the next year , and it will be launched june a year from now .
i don &apos;t see any nuclear power plants with fusion energy .
instead of requiring multi-million-dollar facilities i &apos;ve developed a device that , on a very small scale , can produce these isotopes .
so you need 10,000 laptops .
i think that we can come up with very concrete solutions on how to treat disorders .
if you sell them by wednesday , please go to the beach .
now , try to build a bicycle without knowing that pi is 3.1416 .
( applause ) so i think by now , everyone knows that we can &apos;t drive , or women are not allowed to drive , in saudi arabia , but maybe few know why .
there wasn &apos;t an actual law in saudi arabia .
now given the turmoil in many countries in the arab region , talking about sex , challenging the taboos , seeking alternatives might sound like something of a luxury .
but i grew up in canada , far from my arab roots .
machine learning is now capable of far , far more complex tasks .
on frequent , high-volume tasks , machines are getting smarter and smarter .
people defecate around the toilet .
let &apos;s go back to the problem of pit emptying .
and we &apos;ve got to get them all right , because if we solve 11 , we fail to solve the 12th — we &apos;re in trouble . for example , if we solve our problems of water and soil and population , but don &apos;t solve our problems of toxics , then we are in trouble .
one of the things that enabled australia to survive in this remote outpost of european civilization for 250 years has been their british identity .
and it excites me now to meet people who are hikers , chefs , code writers , taxi drivers , people i never would have guessed who loved the music and who are passing it on .
and perhaps its tremendous intellectual perfection and serenity meant that something new had to happen — a radical new move , which in 1600 is what did happen .
sp : well , that sounds good in theory , but has it worked that way in practice ?
and even our best attempts to work up sympathy for those who are unconnected with us fall miserably short , a sad truth about human nature that was pointed out by adam smith .
it &apos;s our own pond . and that &apos;s how it happens . &quot; &quot; and she goes , &quot; &quot; then how do they get fertilized ? &quot; &quot; and i said , &quot; &quot; well , men , through their penis , they fertilize the eggs by the sperm coming out .
bad zoning , but ... &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) she &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; what ? &quot; &quot; and she goes , &quot; &quot; but mom , but men and women can &apos;t ever see each other naked , mom .
it was right around new years .
this is some of the field work that we &apos;ve done .
the town had a vermiculite mine in it .
the advent of the internet definitely helped her .
and i was dying . she was absolutely not giving me a thing .
there &apos;s an extraordinary woman named clare boothe luce .
it has no nails or screws .
but some were for working , some were for playing , some were for guys to collect their things .
so , act ii : a home reconstructed .
it &apos;s held in a geographic information system which allows me to zoom in .
many of the speakers here , many of you in the audience , have that creative edge , if you know what i &apos;m talking about .
i can feel your noise .
it &apos;s that afraid of the water .
( applause ) so what &apos;s going on here ? what &apos;s happening ?
i was there for my technical skills , both my clinical and my research epidemiology skills .
we just need courage .
this is why we can use a solar cell to charge our mobile phone .
and this is where the solar cell and the led come in .
but the top story of this past year was the economy , and i &apos;m just betting that , sooner or later , this particular recession is going to be old news .
makes it a lot easier to put a colony up there .
it &apos;s saying that women don &apos;t have a right to sexual pleasure .
i was in so much shock and traumatized by what had happened , i didn &apos;t remember any of it .
my talent , my integrity , my values , everything about me remained the same .
the cat came and went through an open window in the van .
and the line of black dots that you see in the background , that &apos;s the ice camp where the physicists are working .
and these people , a handful of people , have been working for 20 years , looking for particles that may or may not exist .
self-organization is why the aids virus is spreading so fast .
he was a very religious man .
it was an fbi agent &apos;s wet dream . ( laughter ) but being a part of this community , we knew how welcoming this space was .
the more i learned about these unethical practices , the more violated i felt , particularly because businesses from my own community were the ones taking advantage of my orthodoxy .
( laughter ) so my first message for you is that domestic violence happens to everyone — all races , all religions , all income and education levels .
i promise you there are several people listening to me right now who are currently being abused or who were abused as children or who are abusers themselves .
it had shattered into pieces .
there were no coups .
( applause )
every foot of distance you look away , or every foot of distance an object is away , you &apos;re looking back about a billionth of a second in time , and this idea or this notion of looking back in time has revolutionized our ideas about the universe , not once but multiple times .
actually , the state of the river before entering the medina is pretty healthy .
and finally , you can see here the river when the project will be completed .
and merging this now with the advent of electronic medical records — in the united states , we &apos;re still less than 20 percent electronic .
and as a cancer doctor , i &apos;m looking forward to being out of a job .
thank you .
i took a couple victory laps in there .
different waterfalls pop up or move around from place to place inside the cave .
well not too much lives in them because they &apos;re so cold and the entrance is actually covered up with snow for about eight months of the year .
( applause ) thank you . ( applause )
and so the power music has i normally compare to the power love when love doesn &apos;t see a color .
from far , this line looks very smooth , like that .
that &apos;s why i am here , to try to do it the best possible .
but critically , they &apos;re briefed about the rules of the game in separate rooms .
so we work in a whole sensory movement task soup of noise .
the third point is , the rating agencies are not really telling us how they are coming up with their ratings , but in this day and age , you can &apos;t even sell a candy bar without listing everything that &apos;s inside .
and let &apos;s face it , the credit rating agencies have contributed , putting the global economy on the brink , and yet they have to change the way they operate .
just think of libraries and laundrettes .
now there are layers of technical wonder behind sites such as swaptree , but that &apos;s not my interest , and nor is swap trading , per se .
that &apos;s really , really , really short .
how can you tell ?
not all civil society organizations are good .
at that time , i noticed that corruption , that grand corruption , that systematic corruption , was undermining everything we were trying to do .
and it &apos;s with that thought that i &apos;ll end .
why is it that extremist organizations , whether of the far-right or of the islamist extremism — islamism meaning those who wish to impose one version of islam over the rest of society — why is it that they are succeeding in organizing in a globalized way , whereas those who aspire to democratic culture are falling behind ?
this reaction expands into adulthood and becomes sort of a full-blown disgust response , no longer just about whether or not we &apos;re about to be poisoned , but whenever there &apos;s a threat of physical contamination from some source . but the face remains strikingly similar .
so here are a couple of examples .
this surgeon has over 3,000 hours of laparoscopic experience .
and for that reason there are many surgeries that just aren &apos;t being done with the da vinci .
it &apos;s a two-way story . it &apos;s israelis and iranians sending the same message , one to each other .
you can go and travel and meet people .
he lived in a fairly wealthy home .
but all of the uvb , or nearly all of it , is dissipated through the thickness of the atmosphere .
now , besides programming these beautiful patterns , i wondered , what else can we get these bacteria to do ?
you may not realize this , but there are more bacteria in your body than stars in our entire galaxy .
these are 65,000 coat hangers in a street that &apos;s lined with fashion stores .
this is a little spot that we filmed there that &apos;s to be displayed on the large jumbotrons in singapore .
thank you very much .
if you are a blind child in india , you will very likely have to contend with at least two big pieces of bad news .
and we got a commission to design a building at the entrance of the expo .
another quick example about sensing : it &apos;s not about people , but about things we use and consume .
do you figure where that is ? it was on a window .
and just like my parents did when they finished studying abroad , we went back home .
when it comes to medicine , having that trust is a must , and when that trust is gone , then all that &apos;s left is fear .
well , i wanted to be just like dr. sam .
it &apos;s very easy to pick up a stainless-steel bottle or a glass bottle , if you &apos;re traveling and you &apos;ve forgotten to bring your stainless-steel bottle and fill that up with water or filtered water , versus purchasing plastic bottled water .
it &apos;s a bad thing that plastic breaks down into smaller little bits , because it &apos;s always still plastic .
it took me a while ; it took me years to find the right balloon team to build the balloon that would do this job .
&quot; &quot; well , we can flip the bus over , we can have it burst into flames , and how about someone , you know , big explosion . &quot; &quot; and people are looking like this ...
( applause )
why talk about social-economic movements that may be more than a century away ?
very , very little .
now you turn the crank once , twice : twice , marvels come out .
they &apos;re putting in place a legal system that could allow for managers to come in , and also an external legal system .
i &apos;ve got it here on my laptop . &quot; &quot; so i sat down , and they played the tedtalk .
one is the internet , the other is the chinanet .
whatever the future is , we should fight against the &#91; cat &#93; .
so david , in that story , is supposed to be the underdog , right ?
but more importantly , though , in the history of that region , it &apos;s served , it &apos;s had a real strategic function , and that is , it is the means by which hostile armies on the coastal plain find their way , get up into the mountains and threaten those living in the mountains .
that is what they would do . pretty amazing .
he checked to see if it was something in the toothpaste , but no — it happened with any brand .
and then i waited .
i became obsessed with the idea of a shared african identity .
your lecture series was one of the first to do it big .
take the example of flutes .
in the same way that when i see tree moves , then i imagine that tree making a rustling sound .
and so therefore , because time is short , if i just play you literally the first maybe two lines or so . it &apos;s very straightforward .
for the water system , the trees are essential .
we made a lot of trips , financed development , economic projects in africa with the world bank .
a hanger .
and i felt that i would have to actually go there and make some earthworks myself .
usman riaz : yes , that was the first one . and then i — that was the first thing i learned , and then i started progressing to other things .
how does it feel to see someone like this come along taking your art and doing so much with it ?
one more time , ten times further away .
thank you .
this leaves us with a way that people can invest in social change .
so everyone wins here , right ?
i had this irrational fear .
but that was my first real experience as a solo singer-songwriter .
there should be a snowball effect , a positive feedback , such that the more names we have , the more we get .
it &apos;s not recorded whether aveling told darwin to come down off his high horse .
do you feel like you are all alone ?
i &apos;d like to share with you a little bit of me playing my life .
and so i make these creative decisions and can execute them in a much , much simpler way .
i sort of think about it as the dna — these colors , the red , blue , yellow , the primary colors and white and black .
children can sleep through the night ; the house looks beautiful ; you hang them in the window .
if she were born anywhere else but tanzania , i &apos;m telling you , she could run wall street .
i also like rock and roll .
but you &apos;re young , you could still try again . &quot; &quot; my sense of outrage about women &apos;s rights was brought to a boil when i was about 11 .
but i think when you guys start buying tickets and flying sub-orbital flights to space , very soon — wait a minute , what &apos;s happening here , we &apos;ll have military fighters with sub-orbital capability , and i think very soon this .
talk very briefly about innovation cycles , things that grow , have a lot of activity ; they die out when they &apos;re replaced by something else .
video : don blankenship : let me be clear about it . al gore , nancy pelosi , harry reid , they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
oil is a problem , and coal is the most serious problem .
now , if you &apos;re looking at me and feeling sorry , let me tell you a few facts .
this is a little bone , a mouse bone that we fractured and then let it heal by itself .
i &apos;ve been making these forward-looking predictions for about 30 years .
like for example , applying the internet , which is now ubiquitous , in the rural areas of china or in africa , to bringing health information to developing areas of the world .
how we die is indeed something we can affect .
and one night , it began to snow outside .
so , certainly the challenge was there .
and this one i learned because i tried to follow everything in the bible .
ab : yeah .
and , if you &apos;re going to make a personal opera , what about a personal instrument ?
so this makes quantifying silk properties by methods such as tensile testing , which is basically , you know , tugging on one end of the fiber , very amenable .
pyriform silk glands make the attachment cement — that &apos;s the silk that &apos;s used to adhere silk lines to a substrate .
and i will give my tribute to water .
this — oh sorry , don &apos;t look at the beam . my fault .
it &apos;s the ascent of man using an escalator , and it &apos;s in three parts .
this is pitched into the future from 1946 , looking at the day all american families have them .
that &apos;s one of the big changes .
the last time china had a quake of that magnitude it took them three months to admit that it had happened .
so , he was occupying every part of my brain .
two years ago , i have to say there was no problem .
ultimately , the police had to inform best buy management that it was not , in fact , illegal to wear a blue polo shirt and khaki pants .
because i was new to the city , i didn &apos;t have access to a stage , so i decided to create my own in public places .
my work spirals from the micro to the macro level , excavating hidden histories .
areas of heavy truck traffic , exposure to benzene and atomized metals , risk cancer and lupus .
and i can tell you without fear of contradiction that hasn &apos;t happened anywhere else on the planet .
so the 10 or 15 percent is pure mischief .
and the patient walked into the house and said to her mother and siblings , &quot; i have something to tell you . i &apos;m hiv-positive . &quot;
and then you go to baragwanath hospital , outside of johannesburg in south africa , and 8,000 hiv-positive pregnant women giving birth — a hospital the same as a country .
why are they numbered ? is this person more rare than the other one ? &quot; &quot; and i hadn &apos;t even thought about that .
thank you .
and we don &apos;t know where it &apos;s going to pop up .
so what we &apos;ve done is i &apos;ve started to do pet scans of everybody in the family .
( laughter ) so this magazine , through the hands of graphic designer peter saville , went to fashion designer alexander mcqueen , and photographer nick knight , who were also interested in exploring that conversation .
it &apos;s not fair that you can change your height , as you want it .
it ’ s already flattening out .
unless we do something to prevent it , over the next 40 years we ’ re facing an epidemic of neurologic diseases on a global scale .
and most people knock them down when they &apos;re small .
they export water molecules through , and leave solutes on the other side .
but it wasn &apos;t easy .
as i sat dumbstruck in my doctor &apos;s office , i heard other words : &quot; cancer , &quot; &quot; stage , &quot; &quot; grade . &quot;
( applause )
hover the mouse over the &quot; &quot; take a photo &quot; &quot; button , and you &apos;ve got a little cat photo booth .
i was mad and disappointed .
writing messages is the essence of my artwork .
allow me to illustrate this point by taking you to this village called budrus .
the organizers say that the villagers , upon seeing the story of budrus documented in a film , felt that there were indeed people following what they were doing , that people cared .
so let me divert for a second as we &apos;re going to identify the problems , the challenges , the behavioral challenges , that prevent people from saving .
what are we going to do about it ?
this is the group i like to target with social justice comedy .
and those death threats are definitely not funny .
this buzzing is a cicada .
it &apos;s no more about going out and finding a tree that &apos;s been cut .
the overall time that we have for our narrative , our lifespan , has been increasing , but the smallest measure , the moment , has shrunk .
so many of us today have the sensation that time &apos;s arrow is pointing everywhere and nowhere at once .
he converted from his anglican faith .
ghosts , right ?
and this is a question that haunts those of us in science and medicine who believe that we are on the verge of being able to dramatically improve the health of women .
the authors looked at papers written over a 10-year period , and hundreds had to be thrown out .
so they &apos;re reinventing it , using these tools .
i think this is a revolution .
we all know about the miracle of miniaturization .
thank you very much .
elizabeth , you mentioned this whole issue of pornography , too many nudes and too many daily life scenes and improper things in the eyes of the time .
and we stand in the far end by the entrance , far from the altar and from the gated enclosure intended for the clergy and we peer into the distance , looking for a beginning .
this is male blogging posture sitting , and the result is , &quot; &quot; for greater comfort , men naturally sit with their legs farther apart than women , when working on laptop .
( applause ) global warming fun .
well , one thing you could do is what some people might call franken-noir .
you don &apos;t necessarily know with granularity exactly what organisms are providing what flavors and what characteristics .
you &apos;re live .
it &apos;s hard to know .
( laughter ) so what i want you to do when you go home is think about this , and think about how powerful our cells are .
and each of us has about 100,000 of these things running around , right now , inside each one of your 100 trillion cells .
i have so many questions , but maybe a few practical things that the audience might want to know .
pg : so groom was the subject of the piece .
but also that it illustrates how disability and blindness sort of cuts across ethnic , social , racial , economic lines .
in fact , cars , who needs them ?
nowadays people are sitting 9.3 hours a day , which is more than we &apos;re sleeping , at 7.7 hours .
and second , and probably the more reflective one , is just about how much each of us can hold problems in opposition when they &apos;re really not that way .
we hailed a boat from a nearby resort , and then were quickly handed over to indonesian water police .
it was a terrible moment .
satisfaction with the direction of the country : 85 percent .
they conduct surveys all the time .
the data structure of thought .
thank you .
they are self-aware , they are predictive , reactive and social .
it &apos;s the marriage of minds and machines .
otherwise , that little girl isn &apos;t going to look like that little girl anymore , and surely that &apos;s as tragic as having the photo damaged .
this is where people were handing them in , and i was honored that day that they actually trusted me to help them start hand-cleaning them .
i am as ordinary as they come .
thank you .
they are very graceful . charles darwin said he changed his mind because he watched them fly effortlessly without energy in the skies .
this drug has now been banned for veterinary use in india , and they have taken a stand .
i am not that caring .
and she wrote about her life dealing with cancer .
i mean , we have articles called &quot; on taking yourself seriously : how to not care what people think of you , &quot; but we also have articles like , oops — i &apos;m figuring it out !
so i think the question of what makes a strong female character often goes misinterpreted , and instead we get these two-dimensional superwomen who maybe have one quality that &apos;s played up a lot , like a catwoman type , or she plays her sexuality up a lot , and it &apos;s seen as power .
this is a pair of underpants from — ( laughter ) — from tibet .
i &apos;m sending money back , and it works like this .
it took us 11 years to become operational .
well , we asked him why he wanted to go up and do this .
our bodies are home to trillions of microbes , and these creatures define who we are .
he helped design some of the air handling systems in this building and the way it was ventilated .
i have to trust the orchestra , and , even more crucially , i have to trust myself .
i think we should make this even more explicit .
here are some selection planes .
ju : i think in five years time when you buy a computer , you &apos;ll get this .
the downside , though , is that swallowing any medication leads to its dilution .
however , upon discontinuation of therapy , the virus can awake and infect new cells in the blood .
now , i want you to imagine that i &apos;m stroking it with this .
how can the nervous system get this so wrong ? how can the nervous system
we know in certain countries in sub-saharan africa we can test and treat pregnant women where rates are highest .
and what herceptin allowed us to do is to precisely target her2-positive breast cancer , at the time , the scariest form of breast cancer .
here it is in a thrust configuration .
but it has to be done together .
so we came up with these two rules .
but there are only two rules .
( laughter ) and we recreated the tracking that led to the insights .
what are the key features that let a computer navigate the world of moving dots ?
but i think what &apos;s new is that we now have the capacity to communicate instantaneously across frontiers right across the world .
150 years ago i suppose the main problem in a country like ours was how young people , children , had the right to education .
one day , i crossed the bridge over the oxus river .
thanks .
this last fall , i went to the snow and ice data center in boulder , colorado , and talked to the researchers here in monterey at the naval postgraduate laboratory .
csi : climate .
and then the last section was going to go around the rail yards , which is the largest undeveloped site in manhattan .
they built it 30 ft. in the air , right through the middle of the city .
the first is wakefulness .
of course there is a bright spot to this story .
and i was in the hospital for months .
and many blood transfusions later , i lived , and that made me special .
there is plenty going on .
stanford , i majored in ecology and evolution .
and so every drop was a little bit different .
and every time it divided , they got sort of unequal division of the chemicals within them .
the great success story of india , a country that so many learned scholars and journalists assumed would disintegrate , in the &apos; 50s and &apos; 60s , is that it managed to maintain consensus on how to survive without consensus .
but , the fact still is that it &apos;s not just that .
well , i think what is far worse is man &apos;s destructive power over man .
she , better than most , knew the power of an image .
here &apos;s a bayonette from the civil war .
and , oh by the way , this hasn &apos;t changed for 25 years .
and then they came for me .
and the basic way this works is this .
that &apos;s the idea , and we &apos;re setting this up in the bay area .
it doesn &apos;t make sense — unless , maybe , there &apos;s a virus ? &quot; &quot; so , we put tumors — - and now we have over 100 tumors — on our array .
and this shows in athletes &apos; bodies today .
even college kids are professional in their training compared to sir roger bannister , who trained for 45 minutes at a time while he ditched gynecology lectures in med school .
this is not a philosophical statement , this is just science based in physics , chemistry and biology .
in fact , it &apos;s the system in the painful process of breaking down — our system , of debt-fueled economic growth , of ineffective democracy , of overloading planet earth , is eating itself alive .
and once you say that is yours , you &apos;ve got to take it , as and when it comes .
how can you obtain the hard core evidence ?
the only thing that really reduces the amount of oil that we consume is much higher prices .
and that &apos;s actually very perverse .
she could easily be up here giving a talk about her work .
and you can make puzzles like this one that aren &apos;t solvable at all .
so let &apos;s try to find them .
well , for that they have to be done as we just saw , en face or three-quarters .
ice .
i did not know what they were laughing at , but i wanted in .
we need to know earlier that they &apos;re getting in trouble , and we need to be able to pump possible solutions into models .
you ought to be able to go to a psychiatrist or a psychologist , and put down your 10-dollar copay , and get treated , just like you do when you got a cut on your arm . it &apos;s ridiculous .
and then , usually after two months , we start designing .
the secret is that we were treating the whole newspaper as one piece , as one composition — like music .
the campers who were too lazy to take out what they had brought in , who did they think would clean up after them ?
the sun made the leaves glow like stained glass , and if it weren &apos;t for the path we were following , we could almost pretend we were the first human beings to ever walk that land .
( laughter ) so in closing , i have two simple messages today .
and they also offered him an internship .
and i think that &apos;s symbolic of what we &apos;re seeing in the world in general , that the world is becoming smaller and smaller , and that all of the peoples in the world are enjoying more opportunities for connection .
( laughter ) and it seems that the only thing left for me to say is to thank you all for your kindness .
so we &apos;ve started this effort . we &apos;ve made a few hits , a few , i think , embryonic discoveries .
cultures discovered the key feature of valuation thousands of years ago .
boards don &apos;t hit back .
maybe i &apos;ll get lucky and find easy prey .
but the fact of the matter is , although people back in the day used to point at the western countries and say , &quot; i want that , i like that , &quot; there &apos;s now a new person in town in the form of a country , china .
so in its totality , economic improvement has been quite significant .
there &apos;s a poem by jack gilbert called &quot; &quot; the forgotten dialect of the heart . &quot; &quot; he says , &quot; &quot; when the sumerian tablets were first translated , they were thought to be business records .
the question is , how do i balance narratives that are wonderful with narratives of wounds and self-loathing ?
time after time , whenever i set out to share some great truth with a soon-to-be grateful recipient , it had the opposite effect .
and perry &apos;s policy solution was to ask the people of texas to pray for rain .
( laughter ) this formula works wherever metaphor is present .
and fortunately it &apos;s very simple .
it is about what we feed them .
one of the things i do a lot is public-private partnerships .
we really approached it at the level of the typology of the building , where we could build these five separate towers , but they would all join at the 60th floor and make a kind of single monolithic mass .
but what it gives us is a harmonic and synthesized relationship of all these components , one to another .
are you ready to go ? ok .
and rufus is going to be doing some improvisation on his custom , five-string electric cello , and it &apos;s very exciting to listen to him .
those part inefficient planes are worth more to society dead than alive .
the golf was totaled .
how they wheedle their way into the collective psyche without us even knowing , and how that should happen .
so , it &apos;s tony blair reading and practicing his speech ; i &apos;ve got them doing yoga inside there with carole caplin ; sven making out with ulrika jonsson , who he was having an affair with at that time .
and after a major injury of your central nervous system , the patients often remain with a severe handicap .
and we had to prove this .
so drink your wine blind in the future .
before long , there was a massive underground potato-growing operation in germany .
it &apos;s stuck in the present right now , but we have an amazing opportunity .
( laughter ) that &apos;s fantastic . i love big placebo .
so this is where the tar sands live , under one of the last magnificent boreal forests .
it means large-scale hydraulic fracking for gas and massive strip-mining operations for coal , the likes of which we haven &apos;t yet seen .
and then , let &apos;s make this really big contraption that you have to rig up to it in this daisy chain . &quot; &quot; i mean , why not start — who &apos;s sitting in the back seat anyway except for kids ?
it &apos;s almost like this thing here , which you can &apos;t even see . &quot; &quot; and it turned out that never , in all the times my dad gave out this pill , the really tiny pill , did anyone ever come back still complaining of sickness .
you can even put in orbit around the earth where we could mine it , although that &apos;s a whole other thing . i won &apos;t go into that .
the national science foundation , other countries are very interested in doing this .
it was a saturday afternoon in may , and i suddenly realized that the next day was mother &apos;s day , and i hadn &apos;t gotten anything for my mom , so i started thinking about what should i get my mom for mother &apos;s day ?
i was happy because these kids were using scratch just in the way that we had hoped that they would .
when other people see my tattoo , for the most part they like how it looks .
and that &apos;s just regret about tattoos .
and they &apos;re at the sharp end of what &apos;s called the weee , which is this european electrical and electronic waste directive .
but he didn &apos;t have wikipedia .
cr : well first of all , the evidence for high levels of violence in prehistory is very debatable .
i see one guy there .
and you never think you &apos;re going to be the guy who &apos;s walking down the street and , because you choose to go down one side or the other , the rest of your life is changed forever .
living in new york city , as i do , it &apos;s almost as if , with so many people doing so many things at the same time in such close quarters , it &apos;s almost like life is dealing you extra hands out of that deck .
and increasingly , the price we &apos;re being asked to pay for all of this connectedness is our privacy .
pretty simple — it &apos;s huge business .
and you can see that casablanca is a little easier to read .
i have obsessive-compulsive disorder .
and what you can do is just , if you give it a twirl , well they just keep going on .
the first day , it was a huge umbrella cap , like a captain &apos;s cap .
images of grizzly bears are pretty familiar .
now people often ask me , &quot; &quot; where &apos;s your favorite place on the planet ? &quot; &quot; and the truth is i just don &apos;t have one .
but the key is that he instilled in me a passion to really get up every day in the morning and want to do better , to really get up and think that my role in life is not just to be the ceo of a fortune 500 company .
you have to be a better husband than i was , because that &apos;s how you make progress . &quot; &quot; and now he began to make sense .
yeah , she &apos;s lovely .
i mean , i know sometimes our lifestyles are very different , whatever .
ms : all right , what is brand gerry ?
ms : ... meaning not so optimistic .
now i &apos;m not talking here just about the bad companies — the &quot; &quot; abattoirs of the human soul , &quot; &quot; as i call them .
we should stop looking outside .
they want to know how often your dog gets outside .
this is a sun bear at the oakland zoo named ting ting .
because using ammonia you get hugely high pressures if you heated them wrong .
there &apos;s two spheres and they &apos;re separated in distance .
yeah . they &apos;re all true .
it is a learned discipline .
all this information is stored for at least six months , up to two years by your phone company or your internet service provider .
so i decided to start a lawsuit against them , because i wanted to have this information .
if you look here , here &apos;s linux in red , and it &apos;s hit 20 percent .
the first is the critical price .
in truth , we do live in a world that science can understand .
but what is happening is that effectively — and the invention of the spreadsheet hasn &apos;t helped this ; lots of things haven &apos;t helped this — business and government suffers from a kind of physics envy .
it will become virulent and it &apos;s something we have to build resilience against .
globalization is getting more complex .
on your rose bushes .
in the social insects — the bees and wasps and ants — the individuals that you see every day — the ants going back and forth to your sugar bowl , the honey bees that are flitting from flower to flower — all of those are always female .
this is mass general in boston .
but what about the part that goes into the tumor ?
so i &apos;m thinking &quot; &quot; how can i do this ? &quot; &quot; so what i did , i got an oilstone . broke the edge of an oilstone off .
we all seem to think that , you know , if we look down on the ground , there &apos;s nothing there .
if you would please , please do it across all five continents and send me the data , then i &apos;ll put it all together , move it into the school of clouds , and create the future of learning .
they must know three things : they must have good handwriting , because the data is handwritten ; they must be able to read ; and they must be able to do multiplication , division , addition and subtraction in their head .
and interestingly , well , we know that plant plankton in the oceans absorb carbon from the atmosphere — the more plant plankton there are , the more carbon they absorb — and eventually they filter down into the abyss and remove that carbon from the atmospheric system .
well , every continent had one , apart from antarctica .
i don &apos;t smoke cigarillos anymore .
alive .
but this is a story — it is a great story ; it is beautiful .
in my opinion , these people are much more wiser than , not only the political elite , even the intellectual elite , even opposition leaders including political parties .
well , the greeks thought about what happens when gods and humans and immortality mix for a long time .
and if that &apos;s true , then what we want to do is we want to go through four lessons from the greeks and one lesson from a latin american .
an option is to go through that rethinking and carefully consider incentives to change how we do business .
( applause )
and they made their own comics , starring the cartoon lunch lady alongside their actual lunch ladies .
a thank you can change a life .
i saw gibraltar , and stars of kentucky burned in the moonlight , making me smile .
but now i &apos;m so heavy , nothing consoles me .
i think that the claim , the aim and the task are all misconceived .
so i &apos;m going to talk about trust , and i &apos;m going to start by reminding you of the standard views that people have about trust .
so i want to leave you with one last impression about the project , or this kind of work and using smart materials .
over time , the buildings got taller and bigger , our engineering even better , so that the mechanical systems were massive . they require a huge amount of energy .
we currently have 43 courses on the platform from four universities across a range of disciplines , and let me show you a little bit of an overview of what that looks like .
so we formed coursera , whose goal is to take the best courses from the best instructors at the best universities and provide it to everyone around the world for free .
i &apos;m going to talk about four different levels of civil response against violence , from weakest to strongest .
but no one can kill the spirit of true mexicans .
i also drove along the streets of amsterdam , again playing music by this same composer .
and i would like to invite you to do so now .
i mean , it &apos;s a very complicated system . someone must control all of this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no . no . no one is in charge .
now , stockholm is a medium-sized city , roughly two million people , but stockholm also has lots of water and lots of water means lots of bridges — narrow bridges , old bridges — which means lots of road congestion .
climate change is already a heavy topic , and it &apos;s getting heavier because we &apos;re understanding that we need to do more than we are .
my favorite example is a drill . who here owns a drill , a home power drill ?
the world has over a trillion hours a year of free time to commit to shared projects .
so they divided the daycare centers into two groups .
and the difficulty of testing our intuition was the big lesson i learned when i went back to the nurses to talk to them .
how much do i stand to gain from cheating ?
let &apos;s meet some of them .
thank you .
ca : so just tell us in one country , how much it costs to make a material difference to police , for example — i know that &apos;s only one piece of it .
but i just wish that i , and the rest of the world , had been moved earlier .
i came across a student who &apos;s absolutely excellent at expressing himself , and this student agreed that he would not show his video to anybody until you here at ted had seen it .
and this is happening in every city around the world .
so there &apos;s no tethers on this , no wires connecting to this .
but ultimately we want to add everything onboard the robot .
( laughter ) couldn &apos;t do it . could not wait .
a great percentage of the kids that ate the marshmallow , they were in trouble .
the question is , why is it that the letter x represents the unknown ?
later when this material was translated into a common european language , which is to say latin , they simply replaced the greek kai with the latin x.
eighty percent of all diseases in india and most developing countries are because of poor quality water .
and when both are ready , they build a toilet , a shower room , and of course also a water tower , an elevated water reservoir .
then one day i went down into the subway , and for the first time in my life , i knew real fear .
if we can , i think the vets are going to be fine .
and then they began to teach us in the context of innovation , economics .
and it &apos;s the very same people leading wall street firms who , on sundays , show up and share .
you look at it and you see it has four legs , the machine doesn &apos;t know if it &apos;s a snake , if it &apos;s a tree , it doesn &apos;t have any idea what it looks like , but it &apos;s going to try to find that out .
let &apos;s summon the best designer , the mother of all designers .
she &apos;s coming out of the ocean , and she &apos;s spitting oil into one hand and she has clouds coming out of her other hand .
there &apos;s a little forest scene inside the chest cavity .
and so the organizational relationship that bonds them is just amazing .
if you &apos;re an inboard personnel , stand up .
in a city where this shouldn &apos;t happen because they have really mild weather that ranges from 20 to 25 degrees the whole year .
i also thought , how to close the building ?
microcredit has been a great , innovative way to expand financial access to the bottom of the pyramid .
africa shall rise .
and in fact , the same has been observed in cats .
but even better , we can do swimming .
you have your list .
i wrote the code .
in total , i found 185 products .
in sandpaper , bone glue is actually the glue between the sand and the paper .
i &apos;m not sure that &apos;s what an intelligence agency should be aiming for .
now each company handles it different ways .
but the things that we &apos;re overcoming are not the things that you think they are .
yeah , we &apos;ve been sold the lie that disability is a bad thing , capital b , capital t.
drug addiction , you simply want more .
for every 400 movies made in hollywood , there are 11,000 now made porn videos .
but saving is exactly the wrong thing to do from the system point of view .
to make room for growth where growth really matters in those poorest nations .
but that kind of conditioning just kept me there for so many years , until i reached my mid-30s and i thought , &quot; &quot; you know , i &apos;m not getting any younger .
number one that i get asked : what do you eat ?
dp : very interesting , adam , yes . long-haul flights . yes .
now the truly amazing thing was , with all those scales , derek , you could not only play &quot; &quot; flight of the bumblebee &quot; &quot; in the usual key , but any note i play , derek can play it on .
last year , apple filed some patents to get blood oxygenation , heart rate and body temperature via the earbuds .
the sensor is just a little strip of metal in that headband there .
imagine spending seven years at mit and research laboratories , only to find out that you &apos;re a performance artist .
but , in a way , the computer makes possible much more than what most people think , and my art has just been about trying to find a personal way of using the computer , and so i end up writing software to do that .
in the second group &apos;s scenario , the walls are alive and actually give dilbert a group hug .
the dome has an incredible amount of water that washes off of it , as well as wastewater .
the lesson of brian &apos;s presentation , in a way — all those fantastic pictures — is this really : that vantage point determines everything that you see .
it &apos;s one of the hundreds of favelas in rio .
rsw : well , i &apos;m going to wind this up and wind up the meeting because it &apos;s been very long .
rsw : at a certain point a number of years ago , people — when michael graves was a fashion , before teapots ...
and i hate that . how do we bubble stuff up to the surface that &apos;s maybe really creative and interesting ?
we can take natural language processing algorithms to kind of read through with a computer , line by line , extracting key concepts from this .
we have wonderful music , and a great music school .
so , no male journalists get the story .
it actually costs an enormous amount to mop up the damage from the dropout crisis .
i moved to america 12 years ago with my wife terry and our two kids .
my cello and my voice are layered to create this large sonic canvas .
his music never ceases to sound fresh and surprising to me .
we understand less about the science of alzheimer &apos;s than other diseases because we &apos;ve invested less time and money into researching it .
so i think about this all the time .
so we have to protect that legacy and be an example .
this is our national museum today .
and engagement is essential here , because it &apos;s not just giving them information ; it &apos;s giving them an opportunity to act .
in this case it &apos;s about 25 percent , based on that .
so something to think about tonight if you &apos;ve had a couple .
( laughter ) without the sex part .
( laughter ) but some of the past winners now seem completely unremarkable , such as &quot; &quot; app &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; e &quot; &quot; as a prefix , and &quot; &quot; google &quot; &quot; as a verb .
so to be responsible , what i do is go look at usage , which often involves going to look at online databases such as google books .
now to the second potential misunderstanding .
in other words , nonviolent resistance is a more effective and constructive way of waging conflict .
i think what video offers for us is a certain degree of reality .
the impact for teachers would be phenomenal .
let me tell you a story .
and that hurt . that hurt because that , first of all , hurt the younger generation , and not only , many of them are demonstrating outside , but i think this is one of our problems .
and we &apos;ve got a mother-infant play scenario that we &apos;re hoping to complete underway at the moment .
and this image is , for humans , the beginning point of play .
thank you very much .
i &apos;ll play the sound of a contact call used by right whales to stay in touch .
( laughter ) i came to realize , as a physician , that i was working toward a goal which was different from the goal of evolution — not necessarily contradictory , just different .
which would you like , if you could have just one ?
what i said about there being no non-aging species earlier on was a little bit of an oversimplification .
so , these trajectories here are basically how we would expect people to live , in terms of remaining life expectancy , as measured by their health , for given ages that they were at the time that these therapies arrive .
the war in vietnam was raging , the civil rights movement was under way and pictures had a powerful influence on me .
and i understood that documentary photography has the ability to interpret events from their point of view .
the search for knowledge is in our genes .
technology is increasing at a comparable rate .
i &apos;d like to tell you a story about death and architecture .
during that period , we &apos;ll likely spend a lot of time in hospitals and hospices and care homes .
and people are okay with it .
what i will give you is an indian answer , the indian head-shake .
well , we &apos;re approaching 2015 , so we &apos;d better assess , how are we doing on these goals ?
so , if you &apos;re with me , i &apos;d say there &apos;s three essential steps in this crowdsourcing campaign : collecting , connecting and committing .
i spent the last few weeks gathering data about rio , and one of the things that stood out to me about this city is that everything &apos;s really kind of mixed up .
we have the baltimore orioles , the baltimore ravens football team , michael phelps , the olympian .
he argues that the two great forces of human nature are self-interest and caring for others .
and a 2012 study of employers showed that deep , flexible practices actually lowered operating costs and increased adaptability in a global service economy .
so , could we use that in mobile phones ?
the shape is the second thing .
they have very different densities .
and finally , i hope you agree with me to change that last toddler rule just a little bit to : &quot; &quot; if it &apos;s broken , it &apos;s my stuff . &quot; &quot; thank you for your time .
therefore , it &apos;s mostly invisible to us .
we can also use this in marketing research , for example , to find out whether or not people like certain consumer products .
( applause )
well , it starts with content owners delivering assets into our database , along with a usage policy that tells us what to do when we find a match .
max vision , aka iceman — mastermind of cardersmarket .
cybercriminals would go there to buy and sell stolen credit card details , to exchange information about new malware that was out there .
what do you have to replace it ?
so from here , it &apos;s pretty clear to me , we would prefer to have cleaner , cheaper , domestic , ours — and we have that , we have that — which is natural gas .
they then move out to the next one , and in the course of just a few weeks , the grass just enters this blaze of growth .
put that in play .
but which molecules should we search for ?
how did earth form and evolve ?
&quot; i want to say one word to you , just one word . &quot;
right now in the transportation sector , we &apos;re creating these wireless devices — i guess you guys might have fast pass here or easy lane — that are single-purpose devices in these closed networks .
nicole : no .
kb : oh , no , no , no . he asked me could he do the left hand . absolutely not .
( applause )
it &apos;s a syllabary . it &apos;s not exactly an alphabet .
and the same problem with respect to islam .
and if we do , then i don &apos;t think that the hope will be unwarranted altogether .
living with this illness has taught me that science and medicine are profoundly human endeavors .
but this time it wasn &apos;t fine .
who was right , who wrong ?
the films provided communality across all manner of divide .
there are thousands upon thousands of them .
we &apos;ve gone to this world of many to many , where access to the tools is the only barrier to broadcasting .
but potentially more important than this is the tremendous value of the spin-off technology that can come from this project .
so we can also generate instructions on how to operate the controls of the vehicle .
it &apos;s part of their visual guidance system .
you allow them to steer towards the little stripe , and they &apos;ll just steer towards that stripe forever .
so we started doing machine learning research to improve that .
cr : and the response has been overwhelming .
two were particularly inspiring to me .
and , most important , they need to learn to respect learning .
i was starting to stay out a little bit late , etc . , etc .
when i got to the — for the next four , five years , i was held in four different children &apos;s homes .
in august 2008 , uae public officials noted that 40 percent of the country &apos;s 1,098 labor camps had violated minimum health and fire safety regulations .
and when they arrive , they find themselves in labor camps with no water , no air conditioning , and their passports taken away .
imagine carrying around someone else &apos;s voice for nine years and finally finding your own voice .
i want you to take a listen to how they sound .
it &apos;s because we &apos;re flesh and blood .
on the way there it &apos;s going to completely revolutionize medicine and health care ; that &apos;s obvious .
that same year , in 2004 , on the other side of the country , another library was completed , and it looks like this .
but it &apos;s the &apos; 80s , it &apos;s cool .
wooo !
this is a chart of what it looked like .
now , of course , in a mosh pit it &apos;s hard to specify a destination .
and yet , mysteriously , somehow the bee flies .
it &apos;s estimated that between 150,000 to one million iraqis , civilians , have died as a result of the us-led invasion in 2003 .
i wanted my monument to live in the world , and to circulate .
that &apos;s the russians planting a flag on the ocean bottom to stake a claim for minerals under the receding arctic sea ice .
i &apos;d like to share three sets of examples , starting with adapting to violent storms and floods .
i didn &apos;t try to figure out what one does with that .
watson &apos;s actually huge .
the one on your left was made by zuzana licko at emigre , and i did the other one .
by accepting a constraint , are you working to a lower standard ?
i think it &apos;s the most viable vehicle right now to pass information across a dedicated cable .
don &apos;t embarrass yourself .
here there &apos;s a cyclist coming down the road and we know they &apos;re going to continue to drive down the shape of the road .
here the blue box is a cyclist and we anticipate that they &apos;re going to nudge out and around the car to the right .
no to a new pharaoh , because whoever comes next should understand that we will never be ruled by another dictator .
now , as an artist , a woman , an arab , or a human being living in the world in 2010 , i only had one thing to say : i wanted to say no .
and it has been the study of other religious traditions that brought me back to a sense of what religion can be , and actually enabled me to look at my own faith in a different light .
what i &apos;ve found , across the board , is that religion is about behaving differently .
because of the rush of human knowledge , because of the digital revolution , i have a voice , and i do not need to scream .
all of their voices had been made by a speaker recording original words in a control booth .
( laughter ) now the really strange thing is life goes kaput , not once , not twice , but five times .
and if it is — and particularly given the fact that we came very close to extinction .
so while waste flows southbound , people go north in search of dollars , and most of my research has had to do with the impact of immigration in the alteration of the homogeneity of many neighborhoods in the united states , particularly in san diego .
they have figured out how to peel off the tire , how to thread it and interlock it to construct a more efficient retaining wall .
you wouldn &apos;t want to let us run the cities , go out and design them .
if you try to change the rules in a village , you could do that , but a village would be too small to get the kinds of benefits you can get if you have millions of people all working under good rules .
and they were probably not aware of this future legacy , but they did great .
however , dna analysis informs us only about the beginning and the end , telling us nothing about what happened in the middle .
at this moment , i knew the girls needed a way to connect with their fathers .
( applause )
i have to go slightly obscure , but really you should seek it out .
now , if that &apos;s the case , then why learn languages ?
and i went to the island of bimini , in the bahamas , to work with lemon shark pups .
and those white markings are not natural markings .
i have a suitcase full of books .
so i prepared for moments like these as best i could .
i would love to talk about the technology , and sometime , in what &apos;s past the 15 minutes , i &apos;ll be happy to talk to all the techno-geeks around here about what &apos;s in here .
65 percent of the landmass of our cities are parked cars .
we &apos;ve got to start having conversations like this , and i don &apos;t think there &apos;s any better way to start than using the market , but also to bring other people to the table around it .
she was very much like those women sitting behind the sewing machines .
and look at this whole range of cycle-based innovations : cycle that &apos;s a sprayer , cycle that generates energy from the shocks on the road .
they will be paid for what they are good at , not what they &apos;re bad at .
they just use a different strategy .
for example , these are all of the dead trees in red that suffered mortality following the 2010 drought .
and you can sort of see this green dot right in the middle .
and so i &apos;d feel a lot better about the whole thing if we could somehow show that an everyday object also follows quantum mechanics .
and i was saying , you don &apos;t know this molecule really well , but your body knows it extremely well .
( laughter ) so you can take a bacteria that really doesn &apos;t make these things at all , and if you could clamp these on it really well you have it taken off the street .
my gift of a good start was not only being in a nice family , a good family , but having a family that said to me , &quot; &quot; now listen , we came to this country in banana boats in 1920 and 1924 .
if you &apos;re not at the right reading level at third grade , you are a candidate for jail at age 18 , and we have the highest incarceration rate because we &apos;re not getting our kids the proper start in life .
just to go back to the states , if you translate the amount of power or electricity this computer uses to the amount of households in the states , you get 1,200 households in the u.s.
the way brains work , i told you all , you have got all these neurons .
thank you .
and instead of waiting for chemical reactions to take place , it uses light .
the idea that nonviolent struggle is equivalent to street protests is a real problem .
( applause )
this one &apos;s not . it &apos;s invaded you .
but you don &apos;t want to get all of the insects .
( laughter ) on the middle , this guy nested a couple of weeks after the release .
all of these were released by us .
bg : glenn greenwald .
i say , &quot; &quot; here &apos;s my email address .
we took 1,300 randomly selected undergraduates , we had them nominate their friends , and we followed both the random students and their friends daily in time to see whether or not they had the flu epidemic .
so this would be a technique whereby we could get more than a month-and-a-half warning about a flu epidemic in a particular population .
and i guess we have a bit of news clip to precede .
we had a meeting that evening with his contractor of choice , and the contractor showed up with the drawings of the platform about half the size that we had drawn it .
voting helps us generate the very power that we wish we had .
well , how do we make this happen ?
i drew an apple tree instead .
but , yes .
and this is one of the early music videos that i made : ( music : &quot; &quot; touch the sky &quot; &quot; by kanye west ) cm : you may notice some slight similarities here .
it &apos;s a website .
the story continues in the 1980s and &apos; 90s .
why do we dance ?
so now we had a hangar space to work in , and prototypes to demo with .
now , usually when people hear statistics or stats like that , you start thinking about places like haiti or other kind of exotic or maybe even impoverished areas , but it happens right here in the united states every single year .
let me give you an example .
this dynamic data allows farmers to optimize use of water energy while improving quality of the products and the yields , which is a great solution for california , which faces major water shortage .
i &apos;m often asked , &quot; &quot; is digital media replacing the museum ? &quot; &quot; and i think those numbers are a resounding rejection of that notion . i mean , don &apos;t get me wrong , i &apos;m a huge advocate of the web .
i think for most americans , knowledge of the islamic world was pretty slight before 9 / 11 , and then it was thrust upon us in one of america &apos;s darkest hours , and the perception was through the polarization of that terrible event .
and one of the things laurie garrett pointed out , and others have , is that a society that doesn &apos;t have people of working age is in real trouble . and things are going to get worse , because there &apos;s nobody to educate the children or to feed the old .
i think that we &apos;re pretty smart , as compared to chimpanzees , but we &apos;re not smart enough to deal with the colossal problems that we face , either in abstract mathematics or in figuring out economies , or balancing the world around .
it &apos;s childhood trauma .
a person with an ace score of seven or more had triple the lifetime risk of lung cancer and three and a half times the risk of ischemic heart disease , the number one killer in the united states of america .
make yourself understood to the computer . &quot; &quot; so the children said , &quot; &quot; how do we do that . &quot; &quot; and i said , &quot; i don &apos;t know , actually . &quot;
text : in another 30 minutes they would reach the theory of relativity . and then ?
they &apos;re all made of the same stuff , but they want their shape to win .
in fact , we were the only people in the universe .
this leads me to the second thing that you would learn in your 30-minute exploration of drug violence in mexico .
they have professional videographers on staff .
( applause )
so thank you very much .
they don &apos;t like that . they think it &apos;s crank . i don &apos;t think it &apos;s crank .
but that doesn &apos;t mean that all , or many , or most of today &apos;s attested languages couldn &apos;t descend perhaps from one that &apos;s much younger than that , like say 20,000 years , or something of that kind . it &apos;s what we call a bottleneck .
that very human lesson , more than 20 years ago , served me well during the last economic downturn we had .
we started eating &quot; &quot; freedom fries , &quot; &quot; and we started boycotting anything that was french .
what sea level rise can we look forward to ?
the texas , oklahoma , mexico heatwave and drought last year , moscow the year before and europe in 2003 , were all exceptional events , more than three standard deviations outside the norm .
she is a 69-year-old nun .
this was on a monkey hunt , hunting with curare-tipped darts .
that i wanted to do as an extension of my composition , as an extension of a kind of creative impulse .
i was playing nice . i had to write the orchestra bits , right ?
the victim failed to identify larry in two live lineups and then made a positive identification , days later , from a photo array .
and that red dot is a marking on the government-issue film .
and , of course , they &apos;re basically extinct now .
sayyid qutb is one of the founding fathers of fanatical islam , one of the ideologues that inspired osama bin laden .
and this is , i think , the predicament of our lives : that we don &apos;t take every opportunity to help because our focus is in the wrong direction .
and all of a sudden as i was going down the stairs i noticed that there was a man slumped to the side , shirtless , not moving , and people were just stepping over him — hundreds and hundreds of people .
( laughter ) i saw an aston martin this morning .
i went in to see her .
and this , in terms of magnesium and the amount of water that i just mentioned , equates to a $ 4.5 billion mining industry for singapore — a place that doesn &apos;t have any natural resources .
( applause )
and so you can make your molecule in the printer using this software .
so what could this mean ?
( laughter ) i don &apos;t know why , but they thought they did .
and that &apos;s simply what i did .
notice that , at full extension , these quads are vertical .
like all our past creations and innovations , they may be used to improve the human condition or they may be misused and abused .
and even down in grade school , things have changed .
they don &apos;t know who was an ally of america in world war ii .
rule number five : know how to rest .
friction climbing doesn &apos;t have any sort of hard positive edges .
a billion of us are obese , while a further billion starve .
thank you very much .
and ecologically , it was a disaster .
what &apos;s the feed conversion ratio ? &quot; &quot; well , he goes on to tell me it &apos;s such a rich system that the fish are eating what they &apos;d be eating in the wild .
and the spruce goose would be a 15-megawatt wing .
kites : i &apos;m going to give you a brief history , and tell you about the magnificent future of every child &apos;s favorite plaything .
so a 200-nanometer bacteria is going to get through a 200-nanometer hole .
well , today , i &apos;d like to show you that through thinking differently , the problem has been solved .
there &apos;s no archive , there are no barriers , there &apos;s no registration .
so what they did is they — i mean , they put csi to shame here — the internet detectives came out .
a couple of things to keep in mind when you see it , it was built entirely by hand , i think they got a crane the last year .
nk : it cost him his life .
so we are moving to this democratization of information , and i &apos;ve been in this field for quite a while .
it zooms it off to the appropriate person , it tells you when the time limit is coming to an end , it keeps track of all the correspondence , it posts it up there , and it becomes an archive of public knowledge .
and we went back to cape town and redesigned the horse completely .
the bulkheads have now turned into hoops of cane , but it &apos;s ultimately the same structure .
and so if we really want , like buckminster fuller said , a world that works for everyone , with no one and nothing left out , then the nonprofit sector has to be a serious part of the conversation .
all of the scale goes to coca-cola and burger king .
this poor kid , clearly a prop — don &apos;t get me wrong , a willing prop — but the kiss that &apos;s being documented kind of looks like it sucks .
so we &apos;re seeing a rise of this availability being driven by mobile device proliferation , globally , across all social strata .
don &apos;t listen to the people who say you can &apos;t do this , because anyone can .
so then we went forward and built our production line in china .
but for many parts of africa , a colleague of mine once put it this way , &quot; &quot; the cease-fire on tuesday night was reached just in time for the genocide to start on wednesday morning . &quot; &quot; but let &apos;s look at the good news again .
so what then distinguishes the israeli / palestinian conflict from that in northern ireland , or the civil war in sudan from that in liberia ?
so for this image , they flew a camera , a five kilogram device with an slr under it .
well , let me see , it &apos;s a quadrocopter , but what &apos;s kind of special about it is there &apos;s a leash .
and whoever tells you that they have nothing to hide simply hasn &apos;t thought about this long enough .
when your data traffic goes through sweden , their intelligence agency has a legal right by the law to intercept that traffic .
no , i made it for the long jump and the 100-meter .
and she came into town and she rushed around and she said , &quot; &quot; i have to buy some new shoes ! &quot; &quot; we &apos;re an hour before the espys , and she thought she &apos;d gotten a two-inch heel but she &apos;d actually bought a three-inch heel .
he then moved across into what we called the habitat team .
and yet , for the next five years she returned in the winter months .
asia actually looks a lot better .
so it &apos;s sort of interesting , if you want to look at how the us looks , here it is .
they have social knits that are very close .
and they were remarkably well preserved , morphologically just phenomenal .
if there &apos;s time at the end , i &apos;ll show you the much more dramatic case .
they all have an idea for a video game , even if they &apos;re not experts .
innovation drives economic growth .
the other two are dr. tsunemi kubodera and dr. steve o &apos;shea .
and you see this thing we call the great wall , and you see the complicated structure , and you see these voids .
well , you see this space that &apos;s created by designers and by the work of people , but what you actually see is a lot of material that was already here , being reshaped in a certain form .
now why is that important ?
this was one of the most brilliant breakthroughs in all of food science .
and so i &apos;m very excited to show you , for the first time , the first batch of our cultured leather , fresh from the lab .
what could the future of animal products look like ?
we showed it to a bunch of guys .
it &apos;s going to go inside something that we use in cat scans and mris of whatever is their good arm , to make silicon rubber , then coat it , and paint it in 3d — exact mirror image of their other limb .
western union : a giant gummy lizard . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) i knew these were all words they use , right ?
i said , &quot; &quot; please call me kitkat in all further correspondence . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) i didn &apos;t hear back . i thought , i &apos;ve gone too far .
jody williams called it : it &apos;s good to meditate .
( laughter ) most of us are shrinking in the face of psycho-social and physical poisons , of the toxins of our world .
( laughter ) bright as a button . all the ducks in a row .
a sorcerer &apos;s profit on wall street ?
the chicago board of trade was established then for precisely the same reasons that our farmers today would benefit from a commodity exchange .
africa has learned , or is learning somewhat slowly , that markets don &apos;t happen by themselves .
it might be irresistible as a tool to amplify our thinking and communication skills .
there are those today that dispute that , and lots of debates about how the mind works , but for me it &apos;s simple : mental images , for most of us , are central in inventive and creative thinking .
all five of them turned and started walking back to the coast and all five died on that return journey .
so again , there wasn &apos;t an awful lot of joy or fun to be had .
and it &apos;s , again , linked to something nice .
and it &apos;s a very hard line to make .
this is bret adee opening one of his 72,000 beehives .
so when people talk about saving bees , my interpretation of that is we need to save our relationship to bees , and in order to design new solutions , we have to understand the basic biology of bees and understand the effects of stressors that we sometimes cannot see .
you are a high-ranking military service member deployed to afghanistan .
finally , these invisible wounds don &apos;t just have a name , they have a face .
( laughter ) ( applause ) like i think we really put up with a lot of crap with our computers .
more boring , but you still have that kind of colliding and bumping .
can anyone guess how many cancer cells are in any one of these tumors ?
now , what you can see here is essentially a sugar molecule that was added a small little tag that is signaling to us outside of the body , &quot; hey , i &apos;m here . &quot;
back in 1993 when the movie came out , we actually had a grant from the national science foundation to attempt to extract dna from a dinosaur , and we chose the dinosaur on the left , a tyrannosaurus rex , which was a very nice specimen .
and they obviously make a lot of money off of them .
now , the world needs opportunities for new leaders and new ideas .
now , what &apos;s even worse than restriction , is that adults often underestimate kids &apos; abilities .
our violins , our cars , our bicycles , our soccer balls , our clothing — they all become assimilated by this voracious , amazing , dynamic system called the brain .
just last year we realized that you don &apos;t even need to have a robotic device .
and the conclusion was it was tasks that included social-evaluative threat — threats to self-esteem or social status in which others can negatively judge your performance .
here , for instance , is trust .
and the baobabs in particular are a great example of this .
so it was the slow churn , if you will .
if you are a republican , you can take a democrat to lunch , or if you &apos;re a democrat , think of it as taking a republican to lunch .
she says , &quot; &quot; excuse me , i &apos;m pissed off , and i know a few things , and we better get busy about them right now . &quot; &quot; i &apos;ve spent my life as a warrior , working for women &apos;s issues , working on political campaigns , being an activist for the environment .
and in transplantation , concepts shifted from whole organs to cells .
earlier that week , i had taken a rather hard knock during late spring skiing — yes , i fell .
huge icebergs rolling over .
the main stem , the main flow of the glacier is coming from the right and it &apos;s going very rapidly up that stem .
what we have as a result is 200,000 civilian victims , 160,000 of those killed in the communities : small children , men , women , the elderly even .
inside that yellow rectangle , you see a code , it &apos;s a secret code : 300 .
we could all use a little more love , a lot more love .
around the world , my shows air in 256 territories in 67 languages for an audience of 30 million people .
i liked your art , so i went to your website and i &apos;m wondering if you ever tried writing any of your own stories , because i really like your art and it looks like there are some stories that go with them .
but it was around this time i went to camp sunshine to volunteer a week and working with the most amazing kids , kids with leukemia , and this kid eric changed my life .
it &apos;s a special feeling .
why ? i &apos;m not an explorer in the traditional sense .
so you see the style is different .
and they were not used to that in communist 2.0 vietnam .
now why ? you can call them .
( laughter ) now it may seem kind of strange that such a thing can actually be patented , but it does happen all the time .
i do hope that some of you at least can hear the difference between those two .
wwb : wind , water , birds — stochastic natural sounds composed of lots of individual random events , all of it very healthy , all of it sound that we evolved to over the years .
now the interesting thing is , reputation is the socioeconomic lubricant that makes collaborative consumption work and scale , but the sources it will be generated from , and its applications , are far bigger than this space alone .
ultimately , when we get it right , reputation capital could create a massive positive disruption in who has power , trust and influence .
we ingest nutrients . we excrete nutrients as well .
( applause )
what &apos;s the difference between those ?
l-dopa &apos;s a drug , as you know , given for treating parkinson &apos;s disease , which is related to a decrease in dopamine .
the harvard study of adult development may be the longest study of adult life that &apos;s ever been done .
we forget vast amounts of what happens to us in life , and sometimes memory is downright creative .
&quot; &quot; you &apos;ve never really been sure of this , but i can assure you that this quirk you &apos;re so self-conscious of is intensely endearing .
i &apos;m going to begin by reciting a poem .
thank you .
they can actually put this in their natural ecosystem without any processing , and it &apos;s going to improve the local soil .
and when i &apos;m done with daylights , should those who loved me grieve too long a while , let them remember that i had this hour — this dark , perfect hour — and smile .
the rain slows to a stop , dripping still from the broad leaves of blue hostas unseen in the garden &apos;s dark .
such a discovery has made me more tolerant of the everyday memory mistakes that my friends and family members make .
it didn &apos;t end that way .
from this realization , i began to take interest in korean history , which had never inspired me before .
( laughter ) in the privacy of my room , covered in sawdust , i would saw , trim and polish wood all night long until a bow took shape .
this has come &apos; round to be that all those naked pachyderms have aquatic ancestors .
and what they &apos;re planning to do is to enlighten us on almost every aspect of darwin and his life , and how he changed our thinking .
something about this bothered me .
simple designs for infection control had not been thought about , and people had died because of it .
i wouldn &apos;t have my new hip for tedglobal in africa .
my next surgeon &apos;s appointment was , coincidentally , right after a shift at the gift shop .
what are the characteristics of a country that would make you want to join it , knowing that you could end randomly at any place ?
so we asked two questions : do people know what kind of level of inequality we have ?
cyberspace moves everything at the speed of light .
how is that possible ? if you look at the visions we have , the visions of how we &apos;re going to change the world , the key thing is implementation . we have the vision .
the third plant is money plant , and this is again a very common plant ; preferably grows in hydroponics .
our studies have found that there is a 42 percent probability of one &apos;s blood oxygen going up by one percent if one stays indoors in this building for 10 hours .
but diagnosing a brain disorder without actually looking at the brain is analogous to treating a patient with a heart problem based on their physical symptoms , without even doing an ecg or a chest x-ray to look at the heart .
and as a special treat , he took me to the pathology lab and took a real human brain out of the jar and placed it in my hands .
if we can make this material self-healing , then probably we have a solution .
then you can have a lot of splash water in the asphalt .
most people , a majority of people , say sad .
so in these few minutes , i hope i &apos;ve been able to share a little bit of my vision of things and to show you that words can have colors and emotions , numbers , shapes and personalities .
so , trees : very boring flowers , not really trying to attract insects .
pollen is produced by the anthers of flowers .
so as you can guess , my mother tongue is french .
so i made a vegetable point of view of the growth of san jose .
my body may be falling apart , but my brain is not , yet .
we have paid our dues .
they &apos;re the ones from my generation , the ones of us that have grown up into a world where everything is paperless , and where some of our best conversations have happened upon a screen .
or the man who decides that he is going to take his life , uses facebook as a way to say goodbye to friends and family .
but my daughter never complained .
i used education for emancipation .
but look what we just did today .
that &apos;s bad , but there are places like that .
so keep both of those ideas of remoteness .
so , you know , it puts the teacher into a tough bind , you have to think .
there isn &apos;t a single licensed architect in the whole county .
so the public school students are about 86 percent african-american .
in 1995 , we started working on a two-year investigative research project to try and find out what was going on .
we rescued over 550 dancing bears .
there &apos;s nothing wrong with you .
explore your intersections .
in 2009 , there were 500 bomb blasts across pakistan .
he killed 28 .
if you deviate too much in the parameters that are close to the midline of that life-permitting survival range , you go into disease or death .
so we have an in-built system within our own lives that ensures some kind of continuity .
i could give you fine motor control , or i could let you curl 40 pounds ; i probably can &apos;t do both .
so , we went back .
but then as it gets closer to the tree , look at the close-up . and see if you can see it land .
and from what i heard from our new president , i &apos;m very optimistic . thank you .
just simple &quot; &quot; bolt a to b &quot; &quot; and they will be able to put them together .
and those are the pieces of wood . those are the instructions .
and it took this picture of earth .
we live in difficult and challenging economic times , of course .
now , what happens to cooperation when the holy grail — the holy trinity , even — of clarity , measurement , accountability — appears ?
and we are quite effective at that — failing .
thank you .
it can only add new boxes , new bones in the skeleton .
for example , our over-centralized grid is very vulnerable to cascading and potentially economy-shattering blackouts caused by bad space weather or other natural disasters or a terrorist attack .
but as efficiency in buildings and industry starts to grow faster than the economy , america &apos;s electricity use could actually shrink , even with the little extra use required for those efficient electrified autos .
when i started using the wheelchair , it was a tremendous new freedom .
for me , the wheelchair becomes a vehicle for transformation .
so i &apos;ve been thinking about that problem , and a thinker who has helped me think about it is a guy named joseph soloveitchik , who was a rabbi who wrote a book called &quot; &quot; the lonely man of faith &quot; &quot; in 1965 .
no virtuous act is quite as virtuous from the standpoint of our friend or foe as from our own standpoint .
and she couldn &apos;t hold her pee any longer .
genital inspections outside of bath change rooms at public pools ?
and this is von neumann and morgenstern , who wrote the &quot; &quot; theory of games . &quot; &quot; all these forces came together there , in princeton .
( laughter ) the input and the output was by teletype tape at first .
they have shown an exemplary bravery in confronting the brutal dictatorship of gaddafi .
for four decades gaddafi &apos;s tyrannical regime destroyed the infrastructure as well as the culture and the moral fabric of libyan society .
and there &apos;s nothing like swimming for 50 hours in the ocean that gets you thinking about things like this .
no one &apos;s ever done it without a shark cage .
so to make matters even more difficult , it &apos;s a very young planet .
you get — this is a building in hyderabad , india .
it was released in poland to create friction between frank and hitler , so that hitler would imagine frank was trying to usurp his power .
polygamy is widely practiced in kenya .
we haven &apos;t yet understood that we &apos;re going at a much faster pace than the planet can sustain .
it &apos;s too late to be pessimistic — really too late .
how would we ever learn such a model ?
and we finally are starting to fulfill now some of the promises of those early pioneers , of turing and von neumann and mcculloch and pitts .
i would propose two kinds which both have much to do with cities .
hundreds of kilometers of greenways criss-crossing cities in all directions .
what &apos;s the heart of this poem ?
let it say something about dreams , and come to sva and you &apos;ll sort of fulfill your dreams . &quot; &quot; but , to my credit , i was so embarrassed about doing that that i never submitted this sketch .
everybody asking , just who is responsible for this citywide , nationwide mockingbird cacophony , and somebody finally is going to tip the city council of monterey , california off to me , and they &apos;ll offer me a key to the city .
wait for the man with the mockingbird . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) yeah . and then come the news crews , and the man-in-the-street interviews , and the letters to the editor .
there &apos;s the map showing , on the left-hand side , that hospital — actually that &apos;s a hospital ship .
after the earthquake , immediately , people all over the world , mappers who wanted to help , and could , looked at that imagery , built the map , quickly building it up .
she &apos;s from new york , she &apos;s a young woman who was courageously living her truth , but hatred ended her life .
in 2001 , my mom , who had moved to san francisco , called me and told me that my green card petition came through , that i could now move to the united states .
( laughter ) you know , that &apos;s what you call a lead . ( laughter )
and it &apos;s , it &apos;s a kind of — you know , charles i got beheaded somewhere early in the 17th century .
each column is effectively a hybrid of two columns .
at one point i simply wanted to jump inside this image , so to say , i bought these red and blue 3d glasses , got up very close to the screen , but still that wasn &apos;t the same as being able to walk around and touch things .
her daughter , me , the village idiot with the ice cream cone in the middle of her forehead , is still standing there , slack-jawed .
we want to curl up and say , &quot; &quot; tell it to me , tell it to me .
all right .
i &apos;m sorry if i put that idea in your head .
the packaging , and the website , and you need to continue to really touch the user , in many ways .
and here &apos;s the public service announcement for this project .
learning became reinforced . bands of apes ventured into the open .
it arises around cracks in the earth .
and this piece is &quot; &quot; frost . &quot; &quot; and what she did was she went out on a cold , dry night and breathed back and forth on the lawn to leave — to leave her life &apos;s mark , the mark of her life .
so i thought , okay , i have to have some criteria of how to choose work .
what does that do to the payments and to the interest rates and so forth ?
but that math liberation didn &apos;t get into education yet .
( laughter ) so the physics is that you cannot prove a hypothesis , but it &apos;s easy to disprove it — any hypothesis is shaky .
think about toyota .
one monkey is controlling the x dimension , the other monkey is controlling the y dimension .
bg : how many times have you tested this ?
when i was a little girl , my grandfather gave me his little silver pocket watch .
at one point , your screen is filled up with leaves .
and thirdly , how does life make things disappear into systems ?
i was on bowman lake in glacier national park , which is a long , skinny lake with sort of mountains upside down in it , and my partner and i have a rowing shell .
i &apos;m wearing contact lenses now so that i can see all of you .
but now they learn these guys are going to give them less than they expect .
to atomize music culture so that all past , present and future genres can be studied and abstracted , live .
why ?
so i promised myself , the next time , i would say something .
that is their story , not yours .
a satellite would then measure the rainfall for the next three weeks , and if it didn &apos;t rain , we &apos;d replace their seed .
these images show the onset of the rains this season in kenya .
it &apos;s a cognitive illusion that we &apos;ve been studying in my lab for the past few years , and 80 percent of us have it .
we &apos;re not born with an innate understanding of our biases .
and you just got this piece of energy and you just , you &apos;re manipulating it .
when i was growing up , my heroes were people like fred astaire , gene kelly , michael jackson .
even so , in cuba , the music , the food , the smells , just about everything was different , so faculty became family , elam home .
and finally , they &apos;re taught over and over again the importance of prevention , especially as chronic diseases cripple health systems worldwide .
here &apos;s the crux of the obstacle .
you can barely fill out the forms in that amount of time , let alone generate real , palpable innovations that improve people &apos;s lives .
for me , the worst thing that can happen is meeting another stutterer .
and the thing is that i have a stutter .
how did we turn ourselves from insignificant apes , minding their own business in a corner of africa , into the rulers of planet earth ?
bg : i feel there is another ted talk coming up in a year or two .
( laughter ) but i &apos;m not here to share these stories about these two things exactly .
for me it was the start of a long journey , but i decided that day to matter .
and that &apos;s where the idea came from .
they live in a city that has huge hills , san francisco-grade hills .
they basically create a cache of weapons for your immune system which you can deploy when needed .
but , you know , the research that has occurred from hiv now has really helped with innovation with other diseases .
i would look at clips online and see comments like , &quot; yo , why &apos;s she tweakin &apos; ? &quot;
so i start shouting from the rooftops , &quot; &quot; i &apos;m finally going to get a part !
a great deal of this has been happening in the great barrier reef , particularly in coral reefs all over the world .
but there is another possibility that you all know of : spherical space .
and reading is just about impossible .
my dad has alzheimer &apos;s disease .
look at google , waiting for years after altavista and yahoo .
procrastination gives you time to consider divergent ideas , to think in nonlinear ways , to make unexpected leaps .
plastic is not purified by the re-melting process like glass and metal .
sadly , their parents mistake bottle caps for food tossing about in the ocean surface .
because each unit knows where it is in space and is self-controlled , there is really no limit to their number .
inspection , environmental monitoring , photography and film and journalism : these are some of the potential applications for commercial drones , and their enablers are the capabilities being developed at research facilities around the world .
but the coolest i ever worked on was around this guy .
i was exposed to him .
you know , the googlettes — that &apos;s a small project that we &apos;re not quite sure if it &apos;s going to work or not , but we hope it will , and if we do enough of them , some of them will really work and turn out , such as news .
so with that , maybe i can switch back to the world .
and this was not going to be an easy task .
it &apos;s to kill them when they &apos;re still in the water as larvae .
because whenever i found a gap in services , i tried to help .
and then , at two and a half , like a changeling in a fairy story , he lost the little speech that he had and turned into a wild , unmanageable toddler .
people must choose for themselves , sometimes sticking to their guns , regardless of what other people want or recommend .
( applause )
as we neared , angry crowds attacked our trucks and stoned them , by hundreds of people all over the place .
in india we often love to complain about our government bodies .
when you look at the lifetime of my great-grandfather , anything &apos;s possible .
it wouldn &apos;t fix the system .
and that &apos;s actually a shop in calcutta , but it &apos;s a place where we like our books .
( laughter ) and then life was fine , dandy .
because you &apos;re going fast and you &apos;re up at 3,000 meters or so .
what happens if one of the engines stops ?
what an exciting and inspiring event .
it &apos;s by astor piazzolla , an argentine composer .
now , what does this mean to some of you ?
it &apos;s considering what it means for these artists to be both out in the world as their work travels , but in their communities as people who are seeing and thinking about the issues that face us .
that signal goes to the web , the cloud , and then it can be processed and sent anywhere : to a caregiver , to a physician , back to the patient , etc .
and , as a cardiologist , to think that you could see in real time a patient , an individual , anywhere in the world on your smartphone , watching your rhythm — that &apos;s incredible , and it &apos;s with us today .
they &apos;re on the international stage .
it might seem frivolous , but it &apos;s not .
we are not just women .
i have another confession .
raven shed his feathers , bear his fur , and salmon her scales , and then , they would dance .
even though they look different on the outside , inside , they &apos;re all the same , and from time to time they would gather at a sacred cave deep inside the forest to celebrate their unity .
a few weeks later , you have your engineered organ that we &apos;re able to implant back into the patient .
now today , many clinical trials are using different kinds of stem cells for heart disease .
inside every cell in your body lies your genome .
so why should we be interested in aging at all ?
we believe that the blast was right outside the gate of taji , we &apos;re heading to that location now .
when i met the guys , and 10 of them agreed to take cameras — in total , 21 ended up filming .
it selects a point , it guides the drill to that point , it pierces the dry wall , leaving a half-inch hole before traveling to the next location .
we worked with , by the way , honeybee robotics . this is the brain .
boy : about the second one .
and within two days the bridge was closed to the public .
so , these are the dark ages .
but just very quickly — we &apos;ll just see if i can do this quick .
( applause )
and then this incredible thing happened .
but it &apos;s extremely difficult to move oil absorbent against the winds , the surface currents and the waves .
essentially , open hardware is a license .
one of the most common is climbing the secret staircase and losing ourselves .
we &apos;re not locked into cooperation the way bees and ants are .
in fact , it &apos;s so fast we were able to add a new point on the extreme animal movement spectrum .
and again , we were in for a surprise .
this chart maps the teacher &apos;s heart rate against the noise level .
hospital sound is getting worse all the time .
mt : in other words , if we do not yet have the technological solutions , would illusions serve the same purpose ?
abracadabra .
we can then choose , from among a range of options , the best one .
and this is exactly what the archeological record shows .
what i think makes america great is its spirit of reinvention .
but all the research proves otherwise .
what if — ( game ) nathan : here it comes . yay !
it could share information looking down at a screen .
in fact , nothing counts , and death is coming for us all .
we turned it into a complete tv control room .
it doesn &apos;t ; it begins with the beginning of life .
and there are those individuals who have incredible artistic abilities .
but you might not realize that our ability to look into the body in this simple way , using our senses , is quite recent .
i percussed . i palpated . i listened to the chest .
so we go , &quot; &quot; sit , &quot; &quot; on the couch ; &quot; &quot; sit , &quot; &quot; tummy-rub ; &quot; &quot; sit , &quot; &quot; look , i throw a tennis ball ; &quot; &quot; sit , &quot; &quot; say hello to that other dog .
&quot; phoenix , come here , take this , and go to jamie , please . &quot;
later , while checking my school bag , my mother got hold of my school assignment and immediately saw that the signature was forged .
my father made false papers for the american deserters who did not wish to take up arms against the vietnamese .
it varies a bit province to province .
so no surprises then that the proportion that actually used clean needles every time they injected in the last week is just about one in 10 , and the other nine in 10 are sharing .
and she said , &quot; &quot; well , he &apos;s saying , &apos; who the hell are you to walk into my house , some rich american with your cameras around your neck , accusing me of enslaving my niece ?
did i know anything about this ?
for artists , we &apos;re making new worlds that we can uncover and explore .
we &apos;re going to move now from the biological and the macroscopic world , down into the atomic world , as we fly into a lattice of atoms .
outwards in our society , in our law and our ethics , etc . and so what i &apos;d like to do with my remaining time is basically flesh out a couple of these .
so one example of this that has big resonance in the policy realm is how this plays out on our very real war of ideas that we &apos;re fighting against radical groups .
in two of the three great arenas of life , by the time len was 30 , len was enormously successful .
this is the most venerable of the happinesses , traditionally .
so today , i would like to talk to you about the relationship between theater and technology .
it &apos;s as though the mystery of the person they &apos;re interacting with and connecting allows them to be themselves just a bit more .
it was done by a guy named goose .
here &apos;s how the song goes .
women and children , especially the poor , are at the bottom .
the woman &apos;s face looks like a watermelon .
it was climbing , it was ruins .
( silence ) thank you for trusting me .
so let me start in on that problem .
so , when we did this for responses from the standard method and from our encoder and transducer .
the big idea , i think , is more political .
so that was really kind of heartbreaking for us , because we thought this was going to really take off .
listen , my lab is not in the ear-manufacturing business .
my lab started working on this , and i want to show you the result .
i was born unable to see most colors .
and i did the tests in the royal air force to become a pilot , and sure enough , i failed .
rs : great things happen .
because trying harder is not going to fix a broken system .
but i learned two very , very important lessons there on mt . everest , and i thank my team of sherpas who taught me this .
the other thing which was so challenging about this swim is not just the altitude .
now , the other thing that fashion designers have done to survive in this culture of copying is they &apos;ve learned how to copy themselves .
now , the fast fashion giants have probably benefited the most from the lack of copyright protection in the fashion industry .
so as a rookie teacher , i created opportunity .
she has an issue with authority .
i talked about this masculinity that one need not perform .
so , i tried going to the art store .
but , of course , each emotion then would need a particular antidote .
flying monks .
so here &apos;s some of the characters that we have .
i need more light .
amazing — it just popped out .
but einstein realized that newton had left something out of the story , because even newton had written that although he understood how to calculate the effect of gravity , he &apos;d been unable to figure out how it really works .
well , as best we can tell , there are about two to three million disks having been published — so 78s , long-playing records and cds — or at least that &apos;s the largest archives of published materials we &apos;ve been able to sort of point at .
we tended towards longer-term things and also things that people can reuse and make into new movies , which has just been great fun .
we also found some interesting things about the symbols people use in passwords .
he says , in fact , you &apos;ve already remembered it .
and so i started to look at what the marketing looked like .
it &apos;s people back home , people that support their work , people like these .
a year ago i was in tunis , and i met the imam of a very small mosque , an old man .
the good news is that it doesn &apos;t have to be .
he was totally stoic . i couldn &apos;t see a twitch of his eyebrow .
the murder happened a little over 21 years ago , january the 18th , 1991 , in a small bedroom community of lynwood , california , just a few miles southeast of los angeles .
we can look at all of the different equations that go into making the ice grow or melt or change shape .
climate models in the 1990s took an even smaller chunk of that , only about three orders of magnitude .
but there is a continuous world from walking , biking , driving , flying — there are people on all levels , and most people tend to be somewhere in the middle .
that &apos;s india and this is china . size is population .
sand dunes are almost like ready-made buildings in a way .
about the size of the great wall of china , this would hardly be an invisible structure .
in 1989 , more than 90,000 employees worked for the stasi .
so i think , for these people , we should do something , and especially if you see the german history , where so many people had to escape and they asked for asylum in other countries and they didn &apos;t get it , so it would be a good sign to give him asylum .
&quot; &quot; i bet no member of the media passed the test , &quot; &quot; he said .
this is very widespread .
so books really are alive .
i &apos;m thinking also about breaking out of the box of the traditional book and pushing that linear format , and try to push the structure of the book itself so that the book can become fully sculptural .
here &apos;s why : evolution always wins .
people who got infections either recovered , if they were lucky , or they died .
all right . so we &apos;re going to immerse ourselves in the 72 percent of the planet because , you know , it &apos;s really naive to think that the easter bunny put all the resources on the continents .
there are more active volcanoes beneath the sea than on land by two orders of magnitude .
and in those places where we bring the price down but we don &apos;t see those earnings pop , we bring the prices back up .
what we saw is a lot of people — actually , at the beginning , we saw a lot more people opening the app because they were curious what they would find when they opened it .
banks , credit card companies and other financial institutions don &apos;t know us on a personal level , but they do have a way of trusting us , and that &apos;s through our credit scores .
she gave them credit because she trusted them .
( laughter ) the next project is the library in gando .
from gando , my home village in burkina faso , to berlin in germany to become an architect is a big , big step .
we can start by looking to farmers like eduardo .
and he grabs my arm and the translator &apos;s , and ducks us under a bush and says , &quot; &quot; watch this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shush , &quot; &quot; he says again for the 500th time to me .
now , in the course of time , we &apos;ve come to realize that different parts of the brain do different things .
now , about a hundred thousand patients in the world have received deep brain stimulation , and i &apos;m going to show you some examples of using deep brain stimulation to treat disorders of movement , disorders of mood and disorders of cognition .
now most people never even heard about this law , including members of congress .
the rest were outside at a new memorial .
and the third string is pretty innovative .
luckily , all of this changed a couple of centuries later .
that &apos;s what opportunity-makers do .
( laughter ) i think she was following me at that point .
it &apos;s a system that gradually varies its functionality by varying elasticity .
we placed it inside a box with magnetic sensors , and that allowed us to create this 3-dimensional point cloud and visualize the complex architecture of the silkworm cocoon .
josh .
bill t.
pretty amazing that plants and this darpa grand challenge winner is one of the reasons we &apos;re getting ahead of ebola .
how old do you think it was from when it was picked ?
( laughter ) this is not about overwhelming force , but proportional force .
i knew we &apos;d kick ass in the war with the leviathan force .
so if it worked better for traffic , if it was better for mobility , if it was safer , better for business , we would keep it , and if it didn &apos;t work , no harm , no foul , we could put it back the way that it was , because these were temporary materials .
&quot; what did you think about the lawn chairs ? &quot;
i want to tell you about the future of money .
all new technology comes with trade-offs .
and more recently , we &apos;ve been studying resins that bees collect from plants .
it turns out , it &apos;s hopeful . it &apos;s hopeful .
fission .
and we get within about the same price as current electricity .
and a lot of the images i &apos;ve been showing you here are very beautiful , but they &apos;re also very powerful .
they were evolved by nature in order to get a jellyfish to glow green for whatever reason , or in order to detect the coat protein of an invading virus , for example .
now there &apos;s no question about it at all : we will only solve the problem of replacing fossil fuels with technology .
they put 25,000 sheep in one flock , really mimicking nature now with planned grazing , and they have documented a 50-percent increase in the production of the land in the first year .
her sons , one of whom had asthma , were no longer as sick as they used to be .
do you have mold ? do you have water leaks ?
ps : okay , when i say three , we move .
it &apos;s really an island continent .
and i figured , this has to stop .
thing is , it &apos;s owned by the city .
we worked with the norwegian government and with the norgen , the norwegian genetic resources program , to design this facility .
and there &apos;s an old book back here , and i want to read a piece from it .
and the reason for doing so , at the center of this photograph , is linus pauling . about six months before , he proposed the alpha helical structure for proteins . and in doing so , he banished the man out on the right , sir lawrence bragg , who was the cavendish professor .
he said they were wrong .
i think 2010 can be a really interesting year because it is the end of the 30-year cycle , and it &apos;s the birthday of the global food system .
so i &apos;m hoping that by connecting really disparate organizations like the one campaign and slow food , which don &apos;t seem right now to have much in common , we can talk about holistic , long-term , systemic solutions that will improve food for everyone .
thank you .
and even with the foundation my parents had provided for me , i found myself questioning the role of women in my faith .
so he lashed together a microscope in his friend &apos;s living room .
for example , one of the reasons we age is that our mitochondrial dna mutates , and we get kind of old and our cells lose energy .
so , you send the copy to the main office .
here &apos;s my promise to you : if you are consistent and do this , within three months the elected official will start calling you when that issue comes up and say , &quot; &quot; what do you think ? &quot; &quot; now , i &apos;m going to give you a four paragraph format to work with .
there &apos;s actually a well-known regularity to them where the number of wars that are 100 times deadlier is 10 times smaller .
thank you very much .
at : thank you .
now we want to produce the fish ourselves .
if i place that between , now all the dough is touching , but if i stick that light back in , i have light .
but if any of you have studied electrical engineering , we can also create a short circuit .
if you want to choose to punch that punch card clock , you actually age me .
some people reacted in terror . ( laughter ) others reacted in asking you for help , and some people hide from you .
but our two hands still remain outside the screen .
at microsoft applied sciences , along with my mentor cati boulanger , i redesigned the computer and turned a little space above the keyboard into a digital workspace .
you can have a succession of changes .
if you generalize this , something like this happens .
( applause ) i can &apos;t tell you what a privilege it is to introduce curtis wong from microsoft . ( applause ) curtis wong : thank you , roy .
and in telling stories , each of us is going to understand the universe in our own way .
so because of cooking , what once was a major liability , this large , dangerously expensive brain with a lot of neurons , could now become a major asset , now that we could both afford the energy for a lot of neurons and the time to do interesting things with them .
that &apos;s not possible .
now , in genetics , it &apos;s a little counterintuitive .
so we quantified this behavior using custom locomotor tracking software developed with my collaborator pietro perona , who &apos;s in the electrical engineering division here at caltech .
so it &apos;s not just google and facebook either .
and i think , if you take all of these filters together , you take all these algorithms , you get what i call a filter bubble .
and it &apos;s very simple .
well , it is with such simple questions in mind that i started to make films 10 years ago , first with a friend , christophe abric .
i &apos;m going to start with glenn gould .
i want to hear the pieces that horowitz didn &apos;t play .
( laughter ) so what have i realized , being on the receiving end of all this ugliness ?
and that &apos;s just on air .
i fell in love with penguins , and it certainly has changed the rest of my life .
and what the penguins show us — and these are all the little dots from where the penguins &apos; positions were for penguins in incubation in 2003 — and what you see is some of these individuals are going 800 kilometers away from their nests .
this room we left open .
and then she actually built it .
and the way i describe it is this .
the problem i see is that , ultimately , the clash of how we solve that problem of serving those three billion people that need a home , and climate change , are a head-on collision about to happen , or already happening .
let me give you just a story , an example .
and this woman right here , um ahmad , is a woman who lives on the path in northern jordan .
now it may be that all our mobile technology will actually be the same technology that helps us communicate with another species down the road .
the computer can localize who requested the toy if there &apos;s a word match .
and so , we have to drop in satellite dishes . we put in generators .
i didn &apos;t bring one with me , but they really work much better off-board .
so every year , june 16 , we will commemorate all those comrades or students who died .
i &apos;ve got a bowl full of boiling water — the first one who comes in here , gets it . &quot; &quot; and they left .
it just happens .
it &apos;s a future we don &apos;t know the details of , but it &apos;s a future that has signs , just like benki saw the signs around him .
and that is a circumstance that could supply the chemical energy and the chemical compounds needed to sustain life .
and the tiny water crystals here now look for all the world like they are frozen droplets of salty water , which is a discovery that suggests that not only do the jets come from pockets of liquid water , but that that liquid water is in contact with rock .
you can see one right here .
they may not respond in the same way adults do .
( applause )
so , why am i here talking to all of you ?
you &apos;re going to be able to power stuff , so irrigation makes a difference .
and 50 percent of the eu budget is going to subsidize agriculture from mountains of stuff that people have overproduced .
now in the old days , that meant getting out a volume and browsing through it alphabetically , maybe getting sidetracked , that was fun .
so those of you who only eat your chocolate , you might have to experiment .
the nurse just came with it already marked where i had to sign .
australia and switzerland were two countries which introduced harm reduction very early on in their hiv epidemics , and they have a very low rate of hiv among injecting drug users .
it &apos;s quite remarkable . think about it .
why ? because any movement of the superconductor will change their place , will change their configuration .
her whole family suffered as her side effect profile came and went .
that &apos;s why you &apos;re all in your chairs .
it &apos;s the &quot; &quot; what &quot; &quot; detector .
david sibbet from the grove , and kevin richards , from autodesk , made 650 sketches that strive to capture the essence of each presenter &apos;s ideas .
maybe this is peak fish .
we know that we can manage our fisheries sustainably .
it &apos;s about the size of a mini marshmallow .
it begs the question : shall we expand our sense of environmental stewardship to include the ecosystem of our own bodies ?
there &apos;s a number of mines placed blindly , and the team of trainer and their rat have to find all the targets .
in the next step , animals learn to find real mines in real minefields .
it forces air through a venturi force if there &apos;s no wind .
and we spent some time with conan , believe it or not , and then that led us to , kind of , the very differences of our worlds from a legal and an artistic , architectural .
so , a new social phenomenon is emerging .
that &apos;s what ibm does in software services , and they &apos;ve done reasonably well .
and the good news is we can actually , indeed do it .
let &apos;s start this new revolution at the tail end of the old one , with synthetic biology being the way to transform both our environment and our future .
first , transport .
so let &apos;s talk about three more big levers that could really help on the consumption side .
i would love to be bathed in oil .
when i was a child , i started to explore motion .
so he summoned me and said , &quot; &quot; can you train me 150 grandmothers ? &quot; &quot; i said , &quot; &quot; i can &apos;t , mr. president .
why are you here ?
if the shape of the fire is a person with two arms on both sides , as if she was yelling frantically , &quot; &quot; help ! i &apos;m on fire ! &quot; &quot; — this symbol actually is originally from the shape of the flame , but i like to think that way . whichever works for you .
a door . put a plank inside the door , it &apos;s a door bolt .
to represent girls in their different phases of puberty , we have three characters .
periods .
you can see the islands — there are eight islands — that pop out of the water .
brian skerry took this shot . thanks , brian .
( applause )
he had a side parting and a neat mustache .
now , one way of dealing with this problem is by deterrence .
by lying with him keep alive for yourselves . &apos; &quot; &quot; in other words , kill the men ; kill the children ; if you see any virgins , then you can keep them alive so that you can rape them .
i met her two years ago .
so let me close with the latest chapter in tonya &apos;s story .
( laughter ) heck , if i ran the web , you could email dead people . ( laughter )
you don &apos;t write a psalm .
hi . my name is marwa , and i &apos;m an architect .
in order for a place to give , its architecture should be giving , too .
here &apos;s quick history sidebar for you : no woman ever burnt her bra in the &apos; 60s .
obviously no drugs ; no corruption , no skills .
that bigness should be centered on oneself , not in terms of money , not in terms of power you wield , not in terms of any status that you can command in the society , but it should be centered on oneself .
there is no shortcut : it is like swimming by swimming .
if you &apos;re living outside like me , you &apos;re faced with life in exile — the pain of the longing and the separation from your loved ones and your family .
also , people like myself , we &apos;re fighting two battles on different grounds .
now i started to notice this when i actually showed &quot; &quot; star wars &quot; &quot; to my daughter , which was years later , and the situation was different .
but you watch that movie enough times , and you start to realize how unusual it is .
and you can look at more pictures .
it sounds something like this .
we can see the same processes at work in terms of the commerce bank — its dependence on natural ventilation , the way that you can model those gardens , the way they spiral around .
so there has been a project which rescues the dead sea by creating a pipeline , a pipe , sometimes above the surface , sometimes buried , that will redress that , and will feed from the gulf of aqaba into the dead sea .
and a few days later , i was practicing on a single tightrope .
and since what &apos;s impossible is always unknown , it allows me to believe i can cheat the impossible .
woman : i am so happy that my students did this campaign .
( music ) atul karwal : aproch is an organization which has been doing things for kids earlier .
two years ago , after having served four years in the united states marine corps and deployments to both iraq and afghanistan , i found myself in port-au-prince , leading a team of veterans and medical professionals in some of the hardest-hit areas of that city , three days after the earthquake .
we served together in iraq and afghanistan .
how do we deal with that information that is coming in ?
( applause )
this raises a number of ethical questions that we have to carefully consider , and this is why i and my colleagues have called for a global pause in any clinical application of the crispr technology in human embryos , to give us time to really consider all of the various implications of doing so .
we also want to understand better how to control the way that dna is repaired after it &apos;s cut , and also to figure out how to control and limit any kind of off-target , or unintended effects of using the technology .
it &apos;s protecting five world heritage sites .
but what &apos;s unusual about the costa rica dome is , in fact , it &apos;s not a permanent place .
and to me this was a key component that somehow , through this medium of photography , which allows us to contemplate these landscapes , that i thought photography was perfectly suited to doing this type of work .
and i wanted , through color and large format cameras and very large prints , to make a body of work that somehow became symbols of our use of the landscape , how we use the land .
and it &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; guys , i travel a lot . &quot; &quot; this is with the fbi .
so you can see , delta 1252 going from kansas city to atlanta .
so why is that happening ?
this is a very significant issue .
so i communicate through everything from radio transceivers to funnels and plastic tubing .
and to tell you a bit about the things that i make , the easiest place to start the story is with a hat .
democracy .
it was you who described yourself in your bios as a libertarian marxist .
( applause )
now , fish have eyes that are essentially the same as ours .
well actually , that turns out not to be so easy , but ultimately what we want to show is whether we &apos;re able to reduce the reoffending rates .
we need to change our view of joe as someone wholly irredeemable , because if we see joe as wholly irredeemable , how is he going to see himself as any different ?
the big challenge became actually taking the pictures through that telescope .
wasn &apos;t there a way to build a smaller , simpler , new satellite design that could enable more timely imaging ?
now i use this word &quot; &quot; ignorance , &quot; &quot; of course , to be at least in part intentionally provocative , because ignorance has a lot of bad connotations and i clearly don &apos;t mean any of those .
just to put that in some perspective , that &apos;s the weight of two normal human brains .
( video ) wall-e : eva ?
and then the production designer started clapping .
maria was in a car accident , and she woke up on her 16th birthday to the news that she was a complete quadriplegic , had no movement from the neck down , had damage to her vocal chords , and she couldn &apos;t talk .
but then the doctor came over to me , and she said , &quot; &quot; janine , the operation was a success , and we &apos;ve picked as much bone out of your spinal cord as we could , but the damage is permanent .
frankly , four billion clean cars on the road are still four billion cars , and a traffic jam with no emissions is still a traffic jam .
you know , we &apos;ve come a long way .
so we &apos;re living in the age of the global plutocracy , but we &apos;ve been slow to notice it .
after all , no one is actually in favor of crony capitalism .
and i think people don &apos;t fully understand how broad the message is .
so he told everyone , no more hand raising , i &apos;m cold-calling .
very interesting . the car industry has been focused just on themselves .
and actually true to form , renault has put a billion and a half dollars in building nine different types of cars that fit this kind of model that will come into the market in mass volume — mass volume being the first year , 100 thousand cars .
and then i &apos;ll explain why i explained it .
that way you can see that at no time can anything travel , as long as i &apos;m squeezing there nothing can go up or down my sleeve .
you &apos;re not really going to get 72 virgins in heaven .
what is definitely uncontroversial is that , as i &apos;ve said , we &apos;ve got to stop being reactive , and more proactive , and i just want to leave you with one idea , which is that it &apos;s a provocative question for you to think about , and the answer will require sympathy with the devil .
males have a spiked , barbed penis that they literally stab into the female , and they don &apos;t stab it anywhere near her vagina .
from flaccid to ejaculation in less than a second .
of course , that &apos;s not why umm el-saad joined the program .
umm el-saad , asma and fayza , and many women across the arab world , show that it is possible to overcome barriers to education , which they know is the best means to a better future .
this gets reported in the media with great lament .
they have no semantic meaning .
and the reason for this , unless my car valet mysteriously is changing the oil and performing work which i &apos;m not paying him for and i &apos;m unaware of , is because perception is in any case leaky .
and i think understanding that could revolutionize tax policy .
does this have cumulative effects ?
interestingly enough , when you start to crank the data , these pockets of futureless language speakers all around the world turn out to be , by and large , some of the world &apos;s best savers .
as much as i love interplanetary exploration , i deeply disagree with this idea .
but i &apos;m not a climate scientist , i &apos;m an astronomer .
( applause )
quiet parts could be heard that would have been drowned out by all the gossiping and shouting .
and so they appealed to lord blackstone to say these airplanes were trespassing .
for when you think of what sousa romanticized in the young people together , singing the songs of the day , of the old songs , you should recognize what your kids are doing right now .
and this is the new paradigm , which we gathered two , three years back , recognizing that our old paradigm of just analyzing and pushing and predicting parameters into the future , aiming at minimalizing environmental impacts , is of the past .
together , these form an integrated whole for guiding human development in the anthropocene , understanding that the planet is a complex self-regulating system .
( applause ) so , this guy , with all the cells in his body , all have the same genetic information .
now , i &apos;d like to show you a current picture of my group .
and matthew has made this remarkable observation that i &apos;m just going to offer you and let it sit .
but again and again , lived compassion brings us back to the wisdom of tenderness .
and he said , &quot; &quot; you learn how little you know . &quot; &quot; success motivates us , but a near win can propel us in an ongoing quest .
one held a half-eaten ice cream cone in one hand and arrows in the left with yellow fletching .
they dance to son dam bi &apos;s dance on tv , but you can &apos;t even call it son dam bi &apos;s dance — it becomes the kids &apos; own dance .
in essence , they are not different .
thanks to chernobyl , we get asylum in the u.s.
we forget about all of our new middle-class frustrations and disappointments , and we feel like millionaires .
it was the coldest i &apos;ve ever been .
my parents definitely didn &apos;t think so when i told them at 19 i was quitting my job to pursue this dream career : blue skies , warm tropical beaches , and a tan that lasts all year long .
well this view , i think , is increasingly wrong .
why , we found , people were interested in this , is that at work they don &apos;t feel very expressed .
and then the process on shore takes around three or four days , and then , when it &apos;s done , they put the manhole cover back on top , and they push the sand over that , and we all forget about it .
we can never seem to grasp it in its totality .
now , this is a bit of a strange idea , so let me try to put it in perspective for you .
on a personal note , we were pretty psyched when we figured this out .
it means we made cultural impact as well as scientific impact .
i think that the fact that it &apos;s so difficult , the fact that we &apos;re overreaching , is the value of things like the lhc .
the difference was , orville and wilbur were driven by a cause , by a purpose , by a belief .
how many of them showed up for him ?
they were then asked again about their religious beliefs .
or they like , they hope , to live on as part of some greater whole , a nation or a family or a tribe , their gene pool .
it &apos;s really maneuverable . you have a hand-held remote , so you can pretty easily control acceleration , braking , go in reverse if you like , also have braking .
i mean , this is something you can pick up and carry with you anywhere you go .
the light those galaxies emit , even traveling at the fastest speed , the speed of light , will not be able to overcome the ever-widening gulf between us .
the challenge is we don &apos;t know the shape of the extra dimensions .
it seems like they &apos;re everyone &apos;s default doom-and-gloom metaphor .
these clouds form in the region of mountains .
so this is the closest you can get to kind of seeing at least the effects of the dark matter with your naked eye .
almost a quarter , or approximately a quarter of the matter in the universe , is stuff that &apos;s invisible .
so obviously , we have a q &amp; a portion of our program , and people line up to mics to ask questions .
by 2010 , detroit had become the poster child for an american city in crisis .
now the easiest way to fall down in this , and not be real real , right , the easiest way not to be true to yourself is not to understand your heritage , and thereby repudiate that heritage .
well , what then happened over the last 50 or 60 years , is that goods have become commoditized .
and it has no dna .
and that &apos;s the shell around that globular fat .
brains are like muscles .
we want to see the whole thing , so let &apos;s inflate it so we can see the whole thing .
now i make a daily pilgrimage to visit a particular weeping willow by the seine , and i hunger for the green fields in the bush outside bukavu .
it was to be conquered and mastered like the earth herself .
they build schools , they run hospitals , they set up vocational-training programs or micro-loan programs .
they set up complex communication machines — radio stations , tv channels , internet websites and social media strategies .
and in order to make it even more exciting , he added a bit of sacrilege to the rest of the fun , and he brings out the temple vessels .
and it &apos;s an object with fascinating stories and stories that are by no means over yet .
and we also need to re-examine livestock .
but yes there are some solutions .
one of my greatest pleasures in life is , i have to admit , a bit special .
it has been testing countless solutions to move nutrients , gases and proteins .
yeah , i &apos;ll be a filmmaker . &quot; &quot; so i literally came back from that job , quit school , hung my filmmaking shingle and just never told anyone that i didn &apos;t know what i was doing .
and as i looked at it , it kind of tucked its arms under it , raised into a spherical shape and turned chocolate brown with two white stripes .
but seriously , seriously , we did get along , because we had a common goal of wanting to inspire these young people .
virtually none . all of our equipment , including film equipment , was charged by the sun .
to most of you , this is a device to buy , sell , play games , watch videos .
it &apos;s a 100 percent open rate even if she doesn &apos;t respond to you when you ask her when she &apos;s coming home for dinner .
( laughter ) i pulled into the town of abu ghosh , and bought a brick of turkish delight : pistachios glued in rosewater . better .
it was then i understood that abed would never apologize .
and the immune system is more active .
and they &apos;ve been tagged , and they &apos;ve been found to be 70 years old .
because all governments across the world need money to survive .
three hundred thirty-three members of parliament .
the pentagon &apos;s gorgon stare and argus programs will put up to 65 independently operated camera eyes on each drone platform , and this would vastly outstrip human ability to review it .
representative government began to form .
there are over 500,000 local and state offices in america .
but i couldn &apos;t vote , and i couldn &apos;t run for office .
i was talking to warren buffett &apos;s banker , and he was chiding me for not letting my children make mistakes with their allowance .
we constantly have to kind of dial them back .
dimitri : come on , milo . you know what parents are like .
by the way , if you are a boy , it &apos;s snails ; if you &apos;re a girl , it &apos;s butterflies because what we found was that girls hate snails .
and this is air temperature .
we are not using fossil energies .
which brings me to the second technique for handling the choice overload problem , which is concretization .
the typical walmart today offers you 100,000 products .
it was the first time in my life that i had actually thought about the fact that my son would see me as a murderer .
anybody can have a transformation if we create the space for that to happen .
and i &apos;d commit to doing it later , and not surprisingly , later never came .
so you want to swap those out with some good , sustainably harvested fish .
i give it its due .
and i &apos;ve played everything from a vengeful ghost in the time of slavery to secretary of state in 2004 .
so what about mars ?
so what about enceladus ?
i get asked two questions about this project .
how does the reef work ? well , it &apos;s very , very simple .
what would that be like ?
it was faster .
i &apos;ve recorded about 900 hours of their thoughts .
and we were listening to everybody .
most people say , &quot; &quot; i &apos;d like to die at home . &quot; &quot; eighty percent of americans die in a hospital or a nursing home .
thank you .
now , in this discussion today , i &apos;m going to focus on a different aspect of moocs .
many organizations are offering these online courses to students all over the world , in the millions , for free .
it has something that is terribly important — it has what &apos;s called an active and permeable membrane around the edge .
we &apos;re going have to grow more food closer to where we live .
it &apos;s up to us to keep it that way .
space junk is no one &apos;s responsibility .
maybe , just maybe , less might equal more .
lots of credit card debt , huge environmental footprints , and perhaps not coincidentally , our happiness levels flat-lined over the same 50 years .
there &apos;s more to this painting than meets the eye .
( applause )
so these three are not perfect — they &apos;re ideas .
he &apos;s growing all his own fruit , and that &apos;s fantastic .
what was the result ?
( laughter ) thirty-nine inches is the tallest structure i &apos;ve seen .
the line through the middle is the eastern border of the reserve .
these are chitonahua indians on the brazil-peru border .
well , the tablet . well , we thought , well , if we all have this pleasure , this privilege to see all this , to find all these discoveries , what about for everybody else ?
otto marseus , nice painting , which is &quot; &quot; still life &quot; &quot; at the pitti gallery , and just have an infrared camera peering through , and luckily for art historians , it just was confirmed that there is a signature of otto marseus . it even says when it was made and also the location .
this is even more amazing . put this in your speed dial .
no , no , no — just kidding , no no .
it &apos;s when i started to feel that the cybernetic device was no longer a device .
and most people change their preference when i tell them that the one on the left is hitler and the one on the right is martin luther king .
as he correctly guessed , some of these sounds were caused by activity on the surface of the sun .
a mysterious persistent noise was disrupting their research .
i &apos;m thinking the southwest corner of 5th and 42nd at noon tomorrow , but i &apos;ll stay until you show up , ponytail or not .
i don &apos;t know what else to tell you .
and we had a sense that , as we operated within our organizations , it was important to keep information in the silos within the organizations , particularly only give information to people had a demonstrated need to know .
in the summer of 2003 , i was assigned to command a special operations task force , and that task force was spread across the mideast to fight al qaeda .
ca : so that would produce irrigation for the entire village ?
wk : yeah .
they can be community leaders .
this is hosinia , the largest and most urbanized favela in rio de janeiro .
you have a seven-digit number , call out any six of them please .
audience : yeah ! ab : good .
so this sounds pretty good , right ? now you &apos;re willing to play .
we &apos;re going to try and get all , something like , i don &apos;t know , 1,500 thumbs in this room connected in a single node .
and this lack of global coverage is all the more disturbing when we see where people go for news .
when we analyzed all the news stories and removed just one story , here &apos;s how the world looked .
i think that it &apos;s telling us that there &apos;s new possibilities for self-assembly , replication , repair in our physical structures , our buildings , machines .
and then it gives you an output in 3d space .
i &apos;m doing it so we can identify what we &apos;re up against .
you know , i was very fortunate to meet danny hillis a few years ago .
in fact , we even told them to smoke .
but added a twist ?
i know that we have systematically annihilated the girl cell .
in kenya , in august , i went to visit one of the v-day safe houses for girls , a house we opened seven years ago with an amazing woman named agnes pareyio .
their relationship is a love story that feeds the earth .
the little things in life , sometimes that we forget about , like pollination , that we take for granted .
this risk management ability will have broad applications in finance and insurance .
for example , here we see it successfully playing a game of pong against itself , illustrating its potential for gaming .
what makes a great leader today ?
you know , we hear often about good ol &apos; boy networks and they &apos;re certainly alive and well in many institutions .
why ? because we are flame-retarding everything , and we have weak regulations for toxic chemicals .
and as you go down , they &apos;re catching all kinds of plankton , bumping into , you know , little wisps of life that are the food for the planktivores , the herring kind of fish .
but psychographics really haven &apos;t had a huge impact on the media business .
age demographics : the 18 to 49 demo has had a huge impact on all mass media programming in this country since the 1960s , when the baby boomers were still young .
&apos;cause all i ever had — redemption songs .
( applause ) ( piano ) john legend : old pirates , yes , they rob i.
they were very enthusiastic .
( applause )
there was a degree of resilience , if you like , at that time , which we can now only look back on with envy .
and it &apos;s something so astounding and so astonishing that i think maybe as i remove this cloth a suitable gasp of amazement might be appropriate .
so i just picked one of the things that i thought i learned — in this case , &quot; &quot; everything i do always comes back to me &quot; &quot; — and we made these spreads right out of this .
opens up at dusk and dawn every day .
it runs through cities .
i am ready to reach out and embrace a new global democracy , to take back our democracy .
we know that 30 million obese americans in the united states don &apos;t have insulin resistance .
ironically , at that time in my life , i was also doing cancer research , immune-based therapies for melanoma , to be specific , and in that world i was actually taught to question everything , to challenge all assumptions and hold them to the highest possible scientific standards .
400,000 pregnant women were brought into counseling and will give birth for the first time within an organized healthcare system .
because primarily of the power of the internet , people of modest means can band together and amass vast sums of money that can change the world for some public good if they all agree .
it &apos;s all in english . &quot; &quot; so the books are in english , the journals are done in english , but that is a self-fulfilling prophecy .
mind your language .
it &apos;s become an art form , a form of sculpture .
if we obey these laws , we can do amazing things .
and many people forget this .
my goodness , we &apos;re going to hit 70 percent penetration of cellphones in the developing world by the end of 2013 .
he disrupts their creative processes .
and that &apos;s why the last example is really important .
they say , you know , such a way of measuring outcomes is terribly unfair to people , because we test students with problems they haven &apos;t seen before .
high performers on pisa embrace diversity with differentiated pedagogical practices .
you may know this from the media , but what you may not know is that the average age of the afghan people is 17 years old , which means they grow up in such an environment and — i repeat myself — in 30 years of war .
&quot; &quot; because you have felt me , i can feel myself again . &quot; &quot; so the key here is empathy .
( laughter ) i also like to modify household appliances .
i would cut out the light sensor , add an extension line , and use modeling clay , stick it onto the television , and then i would videotape my eye , and using the dark part of my eye tricking the sensor into thinking it &apos;s night time , so you turn on the lightbulb .
if we can have a camera here so you can see my screen .
this entire platform is a working prototype .
i &apos;m going to give a fast example here .
let me get you one of our 8,000 buses .
the captain waved me over .
but still it was a real footrace against the other volunteers to get to the captain in charge to find out what our assignments would be .
and so i engaged my father after dinner in long , sometimes heated conversations .
our first home was on skid row in the lowest part of our city , living with derelicts , drunkards and crazy people , the stench of urine all over , on the street , in the alley , in the hallway .
by 2042 , white people will no longer be the american majority .
i do plan to continue golfing every chance i get .
but what if the partners were to just allow for a switch of posture for a moment ?
so : the waltz .
and there &apos;s an urgency to this .
and in the northern hemisphere there are four sites .
i was starting to be friends and get to know their personal stories .
that &apos;s a much more meaningful combination , a more powerful combination .
it &apos;s actually a lot more than that .
so it was in this environment that we began working .
there were 15 , maybe 20 , people like him waiting .
terrible najmuddin , is that one .
but i suspect even the non-radiologists in the room can find the tumor on the mbi image .
so this is not just young women that it &apos;s benefiting .
well , i &apos;m not quite sure .
is there a real you ?
now , we &apos;re all here to dream , but maybe if we &apos;re honest about it , each of us chasing our own dream .
( applause )
that &apos;s why everyone thought the ligo people were nuts .
you know , it was the payoff of my career , basically .
and people oohed and ahhed , because cliff tabin had been able to grow an extra wing on a chicken .
then they stop growing .
various voices : you will die ! you will die ! ( screaming ) onicha : ezra ! ( ezra : onicha ! onicha ! ) various voices : ♫ we don &apos;t need no more trouble ♫ ♫ no more trouble ♫ they killed my mother .
one of the themes that comes through very strongly in the piece we just watched is this sense of the psychological trauma of the young that have to play this role of being child soldiers .
in every case , these are dynamic , living peoples being driven out of existence by identifiable forces .
if those of you who are here remember that i mentioned that they remain ruled by a ritual priesthood , but the training for the priesthood is extraordinary .
we let them embrace it and interpret it in their own way .
and we thought , you know what , there &apos;s nothing for men &apos;s health .
she says she first got started with 10 packets of bindis , and then wondered what she could do with 10 thousand .
our next artist , balasubramaniam , really stands at the crossroads of sculpture , painting and installation , working wonders with fiberglass .
ln : some had snouts , like crocodiles .
but still , like , they would have six-month-long winters where the ponds would freeze over .
( laughter ) now you laugh , but that quote has kind of a sting to it , right ?
women are getting college degrees at a faster rate than men .
actually , for 10 years .
and i hope what you &apos;re seeing is that these pictures are not pictures of me .
88 percent .
oh , that &apos;s it .
it &apos;s my right .
it &apos;s my right as much as hers .
my father was a professor .
i &apos;ve always felt that it is impossible to engage properly with a place or a person without engaging with all of the stories of that place and that person .
and yet , 46 percent of all homicide cases don &apos;t result in arrest .
in many ways , we &apos;ve been taught to think that the real question is , do people deserve to die for the crimes they &apos;ve committed ?
we were the first to embrace that , and it &apos;s all because we market soap and soup .
it &apos;s not about selling soap , there is a larger purpose out there .
now , if you &apos;re like me , and the other 70 percent of the population who know that we are above-average drivers , you understand that &apos;s a very high bar .
you were tired , but you felt you could drive a few more miles .
you start with a question , you collect the nodes , you refine the nodes , you do it over again , you refine and refine and refine , and the patterns emerge , and the group gets clarity and you answer the question .
so the seemingly trivial design exercise of drawing toast helps us get clear , engaged and aligned .
i believe the government should do more , but nevertheless , the direction it is moving in is the right direction .
in developing countries , the most common mode of transportation is the railways , and the british built a lot of railways in india .
thank you .
i remember i was about 13 , glued to a grainy black and white television in my parents &apos; living room as soviet tanks rolled into budapest , and kids not much older than me were throwing themselves at the tanks and getting mown down .
however , there &apos;s a big problem with the official statistics , in that if , for instance , a japanese component supplier ships something to china to be put into an ipod , and then the ipod gets shipped to the u.s. , that component ends up getting counted multiple times .
he really has no idea as to what &apos;s actually going on in the world .
every province had its own market for agriculture .
again , an idea which is arrived , but not yet implemented .
that encourages them to embrace new dreams , new goals , and progress in the various opportunities that music has to offer .
( music ) ( applause ) ca : we are going live now to caracas .
then the efficiency of such a base station is only at about five percent .
but i can give you a few examples .
and we mapped all the building area in manhattan .
on the right , we reconfigured it : the office buildings form the base , and then rising 75 stories above , are apartments .
and they want the washing machine .
i can &apos;t even name them all .
i think all along we should have been singing love songs to them , because the opposite of addiction is not sobriety .
let &apos;s think about this middle row here .
fortunately , more and more institutions are implementing the more holistic models that i and a few of my colleagues have introduced to the field of soundscape ecology .
and so does every wild habitat on the planet , like the amazon rainforest you &apos;re hearing behind me .
it &apos;s a resonant phenomenon for which he actually received a macarthur fellowship award , which is nicknamed the genius award , last september , for his discovery .
( applause )
and this is exactly what we &apos;ve been seeing with teenagers and kids doing it in school , under the table , and texting under the table to their friends .
i mean , i &apos;ve been a bit disappointed sometimes when i saw this data and all this deployment , just for five people .
it is having access to medical equipment that can actually tell who does have cancer .
and we can &apos;t wait for the other guy . we have to do it ourselves .
now , all that &apos;s needed is a single person on a bike with a smartphone .
so here , for example , we use our sight sim application , once your vision has been measured , to show carers and teachers what the visual world is like for that person , so they can empathize with them and help them .
some people have called a cyberwar what may actually be just a spy operation — and obviously , a quite mishandled one .
yet , what you &apos;ll never hear from spokespeople from the pentagon or the french department of defence is that the question isn &apos;t really who &apos;s the enemy , but actually the very nature of cyber weapons .
there were enormous differences between kids who resisted and kids who yielded , in many ways .
so i want to end by saying : many of life &apos;s puzzles can be solved by understanding your time perspective and that of others .
the groundwater is 300 feet deep , 100 meters .
but because of them , first engineering college was created in a small village , not in the town .
erik moved in 2010 .
now , this year the internet turns 20 , and ushahidi turned five .
natural selection also explains pleasures — sexual pleasure , our liking for sweet , fat and proteins , which in turn explains a lot of popular foods , from ripe fruits through chocolate malts and barbecued ribs .
beauty is an adaptive effect , which we extend and intensify in the creation and enjoyment of works of art and entertainment .
and i found that in 29 seconds , it tells more about the power of , and importance of , independent media than i could say in an hour .
here is where the problem is , and i &apos;ll explain to you as well as i can what the problem is .
and yet , america and africa have got a common interest .
we &apos;ve never had this before because kyoto didn &apos;t work .
there &apos;s another one coming out , she also has a number on her .
how many people think it &apos;s the green one ?
he &apos;s now a friend of mine .
those are the things that i feel sad about now .
i want to dwell in that light with you and with everyone .
and the warmth of her body and the tears rolling down her rosy cheeks , and i started to cry .
she started tailoring .
and that turned into what she does now , which is to go into the secondhand clothing markets , and for about three dollars and 25 cents she buys an old ball gown .
my accent with english improved a lot .
this is five-year-old parusharam .
just look at the advertisements .
if you were lucky enough to be born in okinawa , you were born into a system where you automatically have a half a dozen friends with whom you travel through life .
so we thought that we had to produce a third alternative , and our approach was against geographical threats , have geographical answers .
it &apos;s a collection of floors , one on top of each other , with a core in the center with elevators , stairs , pipes , wires , everything , and then a glass skin on the outside that , due to direct sun radiation , creates a huge greenhouse effect inside .
a few days later , the starr report is released to congress , and all of those tapes and transcripts , those stolen words , form a part of it .
do you recall a particular image of me , say , wearing a beret ?
i am an honors but go home with regular students who are soldiers in territory that owns them .
oceans of adolescents come here to receive lessons but never learn to swim , part like the red sea when the bell rings .
and this is nasa &apos;s view . they &apos;re stunningly similar .
as if . now , the reason this matters is we pay lots and lots of money for teaching people — we might as well get it right .
thomas jefferson , i think , really expressed this quite well .
in this case misery truly does love company .
and there ’ s nothing intrinsically sexy about these young ladies .
it was a hyperstimulus for them , and they loved it .
now i want to say , this is not easy .
electrical pulses form the thoughts in our brains .
but it &apos;s not just homer .
if it was for me , my parents would say i &apos;m not around .
( applause )
we create things .
but the identities of the individual dopamine-producing neurons are clearly largely different on the left and on the right .
in the experiments i told you about , we have lifted the identity of the critic , but we still have no idea how the critic does its job .
it &apos;s how we &apos;ve built it that &apos;s really unique .
so we quickly learned that our garage was not big enough to hold our growing operation .
and that was just a small percentage of the dead .
rwanda is a place that haunts me a lot .
all of them lived below the poverty line .
but i was upset on their behalf .
and we can get a bit more sophisticated .
there are wolves again in europe , and the wolves are moving west across the continent .
there is less need for vertically integrated organization , and value chains at least can break up .
the idea of strategy in business owes its origins to two intellectual giants : bruce henderson , the founder of bcg , and michael porter , professor at the harvard business school .
progress happens when all the factors that make for it are ready and then it is inevitable . &quot; &quot; 2007 . the iphone makes it debut .
henry ford once said , &quot; &quot; i invented nothing new .
they produce sameness .
but it &apos;s a special kind of social norm , because it &apos;s a social norm that wants to tell us who we can relate to and who we shouldn &apos;t relate to .
so basically now we &apos;re eating yeast sweats — sweat , burps and starch guts .
it &apos;s so deeply embedded in our psyches that bread is used as a symbol for life .
how could you keep the law ?
we &apos;ve discovered with aids we need cocktails to work well so that the viral resistance — we need several anti-virals .
but we can only do it if we do it together and we do it with joy .
but by the time that day came , the outbreak had already been breeding for months .
if they get less and less happy , that will be bad for americans .
and the basic idea of kin selection is that , if an animal feels compassion for a close relative , and this compassion leads the animal to help the relative , then , in the end , the compassion actually winds up helping the genes underlying the compassion itself .
it &apos;s important to note that most governments don &apos;t really have the in-house capabilities to develop this software .
the company has also hired a spokesperson .
thank you .
and a large epidemic would require us to have hundreds of thousands of workers .
ot : what inspires me these days are immigrants .
mb : thank you .
why ? because we need them to be successful at reproducing to perpetuate the species .
there &apos;s another way oxytocin is inhibited , which is interesting — through the action of testosterone .
one reason for using paper is that it &apos;s everywhere .
and the procedure that we have is simply to start with paper .
that &apos;s where i call home . i have a beehive in the backyard .
i don &apos;t research what &apos;s killing the bees , per se .
so now i &apos;m going to show you the hands-free , autonomous self-replication .
( laughter ) so you reverse this . this is a very old movie , so with the new prototypes , actually both surfaces are flexible , but this will show you the point .
pjc : and neither had i actually before i started making this film .
blimey .
you &apos;ve got to have a gradual return to the ordinary world , so you have time to assimilate what you &apos;ve learned .
and the third is the experience from the mountain , which is really dominated by the view shed of the spring valley there behind danny , and if you look off to the right , out there , 15 miles across to the schell creek range .
what would you do ?
we did that by putting these artificial spines on crabs , as you see here , and then we tested them .
that was in minutes — 20 minutes .
that &apos;s my sister . she took care of pictures , because i was a big collector of snapshot photography that i believed said a lot .
it &apos;s not as though , as i try to suggest , it &apos;s not as though either you have religion and then you have to accept all sorts of things , or you don &apos;t have religion and then you &apos;re cut off from all these very good things .
is there any room for that experience in atheism 2.0 ?
it &apos;s completely non-invasive , sensors in the crutches that send signals back to our onboard computer that is sitting here at her back .
it is actually the true integration of the man and the machine .
it was almost as if the hole in his heart was so large that even the love of a family , without work , could not fill it .
they said , &quot; &quot; why are you doing this , lincoln ? &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; look , these are the strongest and most able men in the country .
&quot; &quot; better immersion than to live untouched . &quot; &quot; but the real question is , what is the cost of not daring ?
your job is only to be human .
we stood together and watched the maids cut lettuces .
these paintings took a long time to make .
and despite its obvious influence by the ancient astronauts and its space agey-ness and tripodism , it is not something designed to attach to your brain and suck out your thoughts .
it is thought to have been a replacement for the older space ports located , of course , at stonehenge and considered to be quite an improvement due to the uncluttered design , the lack of druids hanging around all the time and obviously , the much better access to parking .
and i got pretty into it .
they were memorizing the names of dozens and dozens and dozens of strangers .
that &apos;s also true of being bidialectal .
basically , if we think about language , language has existed for perhaps 150,000 years , at least 80,000 years , and what it arose as is speech . people talked .
find an artist or a writer — or , heaven forbid , find a philosopher and talk to them .
aristotle , in particular , he was not amused .
now , china telecom says it was just an honest mistake , and it is actually possible that it was , the way things work , but certainly somebody could make a dishonest mistake of that sort if they wanted to , and it shows you how vulnerable the system is even to mistakes .
everything started breaking .
he learns his whys and wherefores , his causes and correlations , his logic , his fallacies .
how do we know that it &apos;s wrong ? maybe you and i disagree .
and my hope is that some of you out there may be able to help us .
underlying it was some very simple ideas that large numbers of teenagers learn best by doing things , they learn best in teams and they learn best by doing things for real — all the opposite of what mainstream schooling actually does .
now for many of you in this room , ending up in management , which is also what i &apos;ve done , is seen as a success .
and that &apos;s actually true .
i &apos;d like to play you some voices of little girls from the two-and-a-half years of research that we did — actually , some of the voices are more recent .
there are really two kinds of negative reviews that we &apos;ve received .
and yet , looking at them , you would see a machine and a molecule .
everybody should have one , ok ? ( laughter ) so you can see here in the lower level of the library the books and the objects .
and it was the idea of creating this variety of choices , of freedom to think where you would want to be , where you would want to escape , maybe , within the own complexity of the complex in which you live .
so institutions could shrink or contract , as , of course , the future of culture is , in a way , the most uncertain of all .
so traditional reactors like a pressurized water reactor or boiling water reactor , they &apos;re very , very hot water at very high pressures , and this means , essentially , in the event of an accident , if you had any kind of breach of this stainless steel pressure vessel , the coolant would leave the core .
but i think there &apos;s something really poetic about using nuclear power to propel us to the stars , because the stars are giant fusion reactors .
they asked themselves a question : if economics could make such a convincing case for early action on climate change , well why can &apos;t the same be done for conservation ?
at the species level , it &apos;s been estimated that insect-based pollination , bees pollinating fruit and so on , is something like 190 billion dollars-worth .
one of the things i &apos;m most happy about is that the spaceshipone is going to hang in air and space museum , next to the spirit of st. louis and the wright flyer .
we shouldn &apos;t be happy in standing for that .
so i chose furniture .
he had high leather boots , jodhpurs , an old leather jacket , a wonderful helmet and those marvelous goggles — and , inevitably , a white scarf , to flow in the wind .
we can click on one of those and have the photograph be the center of the universe .
so this is a piece that demands exploration .
this is the best economic news we have these days for two main reasons .
we all know a lot of the statistics , but just to repeat one of them , median income in america has actually gone down over the past 15 years , and we &apos;re in danger of getting trapped in some vicious cycle where inequality and polarization continue to go up over time .
they call them fast track or vip tickets .
the cash for good grades has had very mixed results , for the most part has not resulted in higher grades .
so ants are using interactions in different ways in a huge variety of environments , and we could learn from this about other systems that operate without central control .
when i first saw this picture , i thought , oh no , they &apos;ve mounted the habitat vertically , but then i realized that , of course , it doesn &apos;t matter .
so , really , i want to design for outcomes .
here &apos;s the thing : everybody loves a beautiful baby .
remarkably — no , miraculously — he lived .
this truly is an at-risk population with very few resources to support them .
sociologists have actually found that in recent years americans are working fewer hours than 50 years ago , but we feel as if we &apos;re working more .
and i wasn &apos;t entirely surprised when the record that he released at the age of 77 , to which he gave the deliberately unsexy title of &quot; &quot; old ideas , &quot; &quot; went to number one in the charts in 17 nations in the world , hit the top five in nine others .
that &apos;s what mexico did .
now , why do i say this ?
in fact , there have been three independent evaluations of this now .
it &apos;s full of panic and fear , and i &apos;d heard the women wailing and crying in the desert .
he pasted up portraits all over his reservation .
actually , that photo was pasted in a police station , and what you see on the ground are id cards of all the photos of people being tracked by the police .
they don &apos;t employ those workers .
the problem is that the active ingredient in there — as i mentioned earlier — comes from pigs .
but i have been taking beautiful notes of drawings and i have a gorgeous onion from murray gell-mann &apos;s talk .
we hoped we &apos;d be funny , but we didn &apos;t know it would be a cover , and we didn &apos;t know that that image , at the moment that it happened , would be something that would be so wonderful for a lot of people .
( applause )
instead , let &apos;s invent to the price point of the electricity market .
water is the key ingredient in the evolution , the origin of life on a planet .
this is fly-by , mariner iv .
the esoteric path of islam is more popularly known as sufism , or &quot; &quot; tasawwuf &quot; &quot; in arabic .
for he foretold of a period when people shall transform their swords into plowshares and will not learn war or make war anymore .
should it be by just walking around looking down ?
and with this , i know i will get certain messages if i really need them , but i don &apos;t have to be checking them all the time .
and they don &apos;t just guess what makes people happy ; they go to places like latin america and they realize that happiness there is associated with family life .
thank you .
now when a particle moves through the universe , it can interact with these higgs particles .
if the weak force had been a little bit different , then carbon and oxygen wouldn &apos;t be stable inside the hearts of stars , and there would be none of that in the universe .
which is good , but now i can &apos;t move .
there &apos;s a fundamental question — in tv , the first act is called the teaser .
hey .
so magic is a very introverted field .
it &apos;s not a typical mindset for most americans , but it is perforce typical of virtually all hungarians .
as it does , i suspect , that of everybody here .
a few days later , we received a call : &quot; &quot; is the data available and can it be used for reconstruction ? &quot; &quot; our answer , of course , was yes .
and unfortunately , there was no detailed documentation of these buddhas .
fortunately , there are steps we can take .
just because you don &apos;t see it , doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s not there .
instead , i ended up stoning my neighbors &apos; cars . ( laughter ) they were not enthusiastic about my patriotism .
i &apos;m a tourism entrepreneur and a peacebuilder , but this is not how i started .
but as the electrons go round at the speed of light , they shed x-rays .
the really astonishing thing though about this manuscript is that we looked at the other manuscripts that the palimpsester had made , the scribe had made his book out of , and one of them was a manuscript containing text by hyperides .
my office was just a few blocks away .
time is unstoppable , and it transforms the event .
aerial images could also be processed to produce three-dimensional computer models of forests .
so what can we do with a conservation drone ?
they just lay out on the surface of the sea and most people think they &apos;re sick or lazy , but that &apos;s a typical behavior , they lie out and bask on the surface .
now , as we continue to tinker with the oceans , more and more reports are predicting that the kinds of seas that we &apos;re creating will be conducive to low-energy type of animals , like jellyfish and bacteria .
and i think some dispassionate , quantitative reasoning could really bring a great deal to the debate .
i hope you &apos;ll join me next time when i will be making an equally scientific and fact-based inquiry into the cost of alien music piracy to he american economy .
none of them are taught in cooking schools .
but we had a philosophy , which is it only has to look good for a thousandth of a second .
case in point : when &quot; &quot; the sultan &apos;s elephant &quot; &quot; came to london just nine months after 7 / 7 , a londoner wrote , &quot; &quot; for the first time since the london bombings , my daughter called up with that sparkle back in her voice .
thank you very much . ( applause )
six years ago , at the time of her hiv diagnosis , she was recruited to participate in the clinical trial which was running in her health district at the time .
all of these ended once the trial was completed , leaving celine with no alternatives .
we don &apos;t eat animal products for sufficient nutrition , we eat them to have an odd form of malnutrition , and it &apos;s killing us .
livestock is also one of the biggest culprits in land degradation , air and water pollution , water shortages and loss of biodiversity .
so that &apos;s a factor of two reduction of the childhood death rate .
the next breakthrough is to cut that 10 million in half again .
there &apos;s a year to do this , and already — i hope to show you a bit later — there &apos;s 25 or so terrific speakers signed up for next year .
i thought the little graph of my business life that kind of looked a bit like moore &apos;s law — ever upward and to the right — it was going to go on forever .
the difference between our nachos and the other guy &apos;s nachos , is that this is actually a dessert .
what i see is a cow about to eat something delicious . what is that cow eating ?
they watch the tops of our heads moving below on earth .
( laughter ) it &apos;s a great way to start sentences .
and i &apos;d like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and where it is at the waterline .
you can see on the left side a small boat .
so one thought is : after 9 / 11 , when the airports closed , our flu season was delayed by two weeks .
( applause )
ok , now they &apos;re duking it out . now they &apos;re duking it out .
the water level of the lake has started drying up .
will you fly back to the u.s. , germany , europe ?
next stop is west african heart institute , that we are going to be doing in port harcourt , nigeria , as i said before . we will do other centers across west africa .
there seems to be a discrepancy .
the surprise is that patient a had a much worse memory of the colonoscopy than patient b.
sw : yeah . she especially likes his latest achievement , spaceshipone .
and we didn &apos;t think he &apos;d be in town then , so einstein wanted to do something special for him .
assign it to a keyboard .
and there &apos;s things that no one &apos;s voice can do .
you don &apos;t need something more in order to get something more .
and so what happens is that the new phenomena , the new skins , the inner skins of the slightly smaller skins of the onion that we get to , resemble the slightly larger ones .
so if we divide this by the number of years , what we have is an average budget of 11 billion tons of co2 per year .
that &apos;s the speed of the destruction that we are having .
i tell people , the bridge not only connects marin to san francisco , but people together also .
the golden gate bridge opened in 1937 .
but he told me to believe and feel the wind in my face .
i had no idea how . i had no idea how you hire an elephant , get an elephant .
this is a shot from the brooklyn-battery tunnel .
and you can see from these images , the site is so raw and almost archaeological .
and that &apos;s why , next month in morocco , a meeting is taking place between all the countries .
i don &apos;t know where julian morrow got that from .
that is when a seed is manipulated in a laboratory to do something not intended by nature — like taking the dna of a fish and putting it into the dna of a tomato . yuck .
the food they produce have been proven to cause cancer and other problems in lab animals , and people have been eating food produced this way since the 1990s .
i don &apos;t want you to think i &apos;m here because i &apos;m a charity case .
did you know the world games happened this year ?
the main goal was to smooth out the interior , and begin to speak about motion , and mobility , and independence .
we stripped out all the vinyl and zolatone paint that was covering up this just fantastic aluminum shell .
so i made my second horrible career choice : i decided to study acting for a semester .
my job is to design , build and study robots that communicate with people .
( laughter ) and if you did that angiogram , which is the red , you can see the man &apos;s disease .
right here , it &apos;s just a focal — right there .
now , the kicker is , everything i &apos;m about to do here you can do at home , because we built this for the public for you guys to use .
it &apos;s just the vastness of space makes it look like nothing &apos;s happening .
if you put carpeting in your house , it &apos;s about a tenth of the embodied energy of the entire house , unless you use concrete or wood for a much lower embodied energy .
i have dropped a blob of organic yogurt from happy self-actualized local cows on my counter top , and i grab a paper towel and i want to wipe it up .
the planet needs women .
they &apos;re revelatory .
you see 4,000 representative species , and you can see where we are .
and so it would be sort of approximately up there , coming out of the animal kingdom . and if we were to do that , we would find out — we could actually approach technology in this way .
it &apos;s how they find the hydrothermal vents .
thank you .
we want to be treated as individuals .
and finally , this bionic structure , which is covered by a transparent biopolymer membrane , will really change radically how we look at aircrafts in the future .
the old man turned to me and he said , &quot; you could pick a red card or a black card . &quot;
hg : indeed ! it was the 17 .
this is incredible , really .
here , i &apos;m dialing a phone number just using my hand .
when we think about how all this comes together , it &apos;s all about software , algorithms and math .
what does it mean to look at it from multiple perspectives ?
suffering together in a common hope that we can be brothers and sisters without the accidents of our birth or our ethnicity robbing us of a sense of unity of being .
and if someone happened to be missing , we would have to , we say , &quot; &quot; fix a plate &quot; &quot; for that person , put it in the oven , then we could say grace , and we could eat .
no one person , no one alliance , no one nation , no one of us is as smart as all of us thinking together .
this is a photograph , and i wish i could tell you that this is a very high-tech piece of us navy gear that we &apos;re using to stop the trafficking .
we have half a million laptops today in the hands of children .
there are one billion children in the world , and 50 percent of them don &apos;t have electricity at home or at school .
i ate really small controlled portions throughout the day .
and i went to 17 minutes and four seconds .
but pressed up against these democratic aspirations was a very different day-to-day experience , especially in egypt .
a full third of those who braved tanks and tear gas to ask or to demand liberty and justice in egypt were women .
the one on the left is an x-ray .
so , i &apos;m using quite a lot of radiation .
here is an m.s. patient .
not stories in words , but stories in data and words .
and everybody can do something on this as an individual .
it &apos;s really dirty in production .
that &apos;s how all wealth is created .
serious problems , big problems , pressing problems .
&quot; &quot; we always overestimate the change that will occur in the next two years and underestimate the change that will occur in the next 10 . &quot; &quot; — bill gates .
now to be clear , we &apos;re not quite ready to do this .
so the key here was to keep everybody looking in ben &apos;s eyes .
so it sees a smile as a smile .
however , everybody in the factory spent his time at the art department .
i still have — or did i use the word still ? i didn &apos;t mean that .
we are changing our culture from within , but at the same time we are reconnecting with our traditions .
( applause ) sm : going back to straddling between east and west , last month we had our second doha tribeca film festival here in doha .
but if you &apos;re still in pain in six months &apos; or six years &apos; time , it &apos;s because these circuits are producing pain that &apos;s no longer helping you .
chronic pain is an example . if you burn yourself , you pull your hand away .
erez lieberman aiden : everyone knows that a picture is worth a thousand words .
jm : now you can actually look at the distribution of suppression indexes over whole populations .
he was then 95 and soon to die , which , wrote roberto bolaño , &quot; ... is the same as never dying . &quot;
&quot; twenty-seven ... a time of sudden revelations , &quot; &quot; sixty-two , ... of subtle diminishments . &quot;
that &apos;s the story of thousands of people .
i think it &apos;s being hidden on purpose .
early on , i think i had a couple of videos where you would see me in it , but i realized that wasn &apos;t the way to go .
it helped me realize something else during this project , is that recording that one second on a really bad day is extremely difficult .
these are all complexity questions , and computer science tells us that these are very hard questions .
and you can see a little bit of double helix forming there .
but what about the conductor ? what can you say the conductor was doing , actually ?
and for the last video , i think this is simply the best title .
there is . head-tail-head overlaps itself .
well , there are lots of reasons .
and do you realize that almost all of those are due to human error and not machine error , and can therefore be prevented by machines ?
thank you .
and in order to hear me and understand what i &apos;m saying , you need to process about 60 bits per second .
now , this man doesn &apos;t need to go to a place like this , which is also — this place , this arena , which is built like a greek amphitheatre , is a place for ecstasy also .
so if you override the hunger signal , you can have a disorder , which is called anorexia .
of course not .
i want to start with this slide , because this slide sort of tells the story the way science magazine thinks of it .
so we know how to do this in many of the ways that are up there .
however , there &apos;s more to know about your parent star than just how much light you receive overall .
i &apos;m showing here venus , earth and mars — three planets in our own solar system that are roughly the same size , but only one of which is really a good place to live .
now then we get the great depression and world war ii .
we circle around flags , and then we can trust each other .
i want to make paintings about that .
don &apos;t do that .
can we stand to have more relationships ?
i am powerful , and i am strong .
you want a dirty magazine ?
it &apos;s a lot harder than you might think .
here &apos;s a couple related examples .
what are they concerned about ?
perk up .
if you get a little baby , and you abuse it verbally , its little brain sends out chemicals that are so destructive that the little part of its brain that can tell good from bad just doesn &apos;t grow , so you might have yourself a homegrown psychotic .
better than lamb produced in new zealand , frozen and shipped to the u.k. ?
i often talk to refugees : &quot; &quot; why was it that the west didn &apos;t realize that famines are caused by policies and politics , not by weather ? &quot; &quot; and this farmer said to me , one day , something that was very profound .
and , since this is coming from a moral philosopher , the fourth would be that it &apos;s part of god &apos;s plan for the universe .
that &apos;s a bono , this is a bono .
now , all over the world , there is one word that people who have affairs always tell me .
and nick , he needs to hold vigil for the relationship .
not anymore .
by creating wealth ?
and that whole thing — it &apos;s two languages both working at the same time .
let me point out some that i really like .
so consider this .
this shows you , for text that many people are editing , when a change was made , who made it , and what the change is .
the before and the after .
where would it go ?
there &apos;s an immense amount of poaching as well , and so possibly the same amount .
but by the same token , you can get your hope back again .
that &apos;s a lot of food .
what if we taught them to work with their appetite instead of fearing it ?
it &apos;s like having an app without having a smartphone .
the people for whom it was a lifesaver could have still taken their medicine .
we published the idea in the journal foreign affairs .
we lament the existence of human smugglers , and yet we make that the only viable route to seek asylum in europe .
but that black line shows what a food supply should be in a country if they allow for a good , stable , secure , nutritional diet for every person in that country .
at the moment , europe depends on importing millions of tons of soy from south america , where its production contributes to global warming , to deforestation , to biodiversity loss , to feed livestock here in europe .
eventually , i created a whole structure based on symbolic programming and so on that let me build mathematica .
but actually i think the most exciting thing about this is that it really gives one the chance to democratize programming .
and so all of these proteins can get basically recycled and used all over again .
why ?
there was a time not very long ago when the discovery of unknown organisms was something that held incredible awe for us .
so during the last 15 years , i &apos;ve been working to actually study the earlier interface here — what i &apos;ve labeled &quot; &quot; viral chatter , &quot; &quot; which was a term coined by my mentor don burke .
but if you think about real life , it &apos;s not like that at all .
so this is a picture of me holding one of the first watercolor paintings i ever made .
now , any of you who are watching anything about politics lately might say , &quot; &quot; okay , great idea , but really ?
so i thought , well , why can &apos;t we do something like that and create a clean energy jobs race to the top ?
now , let me connect the dots .
there &apos;s a huge upskilling challenge ahead of us .
her muscles bulging in her forehead when she winces like that .
then , instead of looking like a plaster mannequin , it actually looks like it &apos;s made out of living human flesh .
one thing that you shouldn &apos;t blame is being a left-brained or right-brained learner , because again , this is a myth .
your brain creates patterns from the randomness .
some people think that we &apos;re going to solve the urban water problem by taking water from our rural neighbors .
now , you might think that this idea of drinking wastewater is some sort of futuristic fantasy or not commonly done .
there are so many things you can do , but ultimately this is about something really simple .
we took the corner of the car park in the station that you saw , and we made vegetable beds for everybody to share and pick from themselves .
i like that one : namibia serving as a model to africa , and africa serving as a model to the united states .
most african stories these days , they talk about famine , hiv and aids , poverty or war .
all of this is driving exponentially growing economic progress .
it took us three years to double our price performance of computing in 1900 , two years in the middle ; we &apos;re now doubling it every one year .
so while they &apos;re having their comebacks on each other — and yours is slightly short because you slightly overran — i need two people from either side .
so if we get that through , then mark will solve these problems . thanks chris .
and i did what every single teenage girl would want to do .
and when i was older , i would use guitar lessons and theater plays .
now one out of three americans is obese , and a second third of the population is overweight .
the carbon mapping of america , where is the co2 being emitted , for many years only hammered this argument in more strongly .
go to a local vertiport , plug in your destination , delivered almost like a passenger .
and that has — you run into situations where you have this great acceptance of what you &apos;re doing , and a lot of rejection of the same kind of thing .
and he &apos;d made the case in a number of papers and done a number of studies , but nothing had really stuck .
and that was the last time that london has seen a cholera outbreak since .
procuring software usually takes a couple of years .
so you agree to dig it out when it snows .
and i wonder how often that happens .
he &apos;s worked for ge , and he &apos;s had a fantastic career .
looks beautiful , right ?
the equatorial regions are warm because there &apos;s more sunlight .
it understands our surrounding world and whispers to me in voice or sends a vibration to my fingers .
ev : you gained 5 pounds since yesterday ; take apple instead of chocolate .
a group of 20 eukaryotic microbiologists published a paper two years ago erecting opisthokonta — a super-kingdom that joins animalia and fungi together .
my foot is covering approximately 300 miles of mycelium .
matty was inspired by that secret to start his own website , a website called ifoundyourcamera .
you can see my wife struggling to stack a brick of postcards on a pyramid of over a half-million secrets .
so all you need to do is snap a blue to a green and very quickly you can start making larger circuits .
but there &apos;s a main difference : the transistor was only for experts .
we have liberia . we have congo .
make it a local issue . and do prevention at each place , in the way it can be done there .
so my goal soon was to discover new places that nobody had jumped before .
jc : right . now is there anything you don &apos;t do ?
and it &apos;s only when it goes wrong that we start to realize the importance of families to children .
it is the model for all future relationships with friends , with partners and with their own children .
i hope that one day , it will be .
i had that moment right about the 10-year mark , and luckily , that &apos;s also when i learned that this idea actually exists , and it might be just what the aid system needs .
she isn &apos;t a citizen of the world , but a citizen of worlds .
olu , who looks nigerian , needs a visa to visit nigeria .
now , what we want to do with our software is allow our surgeons to have a tool .
the ai isn &apos;t good enough to simulate a full human body .
from these interludes come deep insights and amazing new approaches to solving the problems that had them frustrated just moments before .
this is the exact moment that i started creating something called tinkering school .
and write to me on kiranbedi.com , and i &apos;ll respond to you .
so i &apos;m going to move on .
so , when i was in art school , i developed a shake in my hand , and this was the straightest line i could draw .
and instead of telling each other to seize the day , maybe we can remind ourselves every day to seize the limitation .
some call it &quot; &quot; the invisible utility . &quot; &quot; so , turning on a wave bubble might not just cause inconvenience .
these three red dots represent the tracking points that try to keep themselves centered on that peak .
but in the regards to using sustainability as a parameter , as a criteria for fueling systems-based solutions , because as i &apos;ve just demonstrated with these simple products , they &apos;re participating in these major problems .
we could start with the crisper drawer and the size .
all these medications , nothing seems to be working .
i showed some people a picture of tom , and a picture of jerry .
mw : it &apos;s not always easy .
and you know what ?
first : do the unnecessary .
thank you .
( applause )
teacher : now move it either side . see what happens .
we have our edgier sides , too .
it &apos;s peer respect that drives us .
in mexico , nike has run a campaign recently called , literally , bid your sweat .
the economist said a few years ago that there are actually more unredeemed air miles in the world than there are dollar bills in circulation .
and these were the results of the swedish students .
so we can see a lot happening in data in the coming years .
( laughter ) she was basically threatened to be expelled from school .
it is deeper , it is a process , it is acute awareness that we are all utterly inter-bended , and one action by one being in one tiny town has consequences everywhere .
it could be a recent one , or it could be one that you &apos;ve been carrying around for a really long time .
but here &apos;s the thing : no one can tell us what our experience means .
these seem to be natural human aspirations .
the second one is be active .
this has evolved over the years in a lot of different iterations .
or this could represent a college green .
( applause ) chris anderson : shaffi , that is a really exciting business idea .
i guess we seem to be doing at least a few things right .
so what happens , if you want to sustain desire , it &apos;s that real dialectic piece .
but novelty isn &apos;t about new positions .
then we can start to use cells .
but as we age , our organs tend to fail more .
this is desktop gene sequencer .
( applause )
help witness give cameras to the world .
now , the reason i say that , because , afterwards , i was thinking — well , i went back into the school — i felt dirty ; i felt betrayed ; i felt ashamed , but mainly — mainly , i felt powerless .
he uses tiny bottles , the glass is tinted , he tops the olive oil off with an inert gas .
that &apos;s right .
for now , more than ever , is not the time to be blindly following , blindly accepting , blindly trusting .
first , we &apos;ve got to be ready and willing to take experts on and dispense with this notion of them as modern-day apostles .
it &apos;s this entire ecosystem of low-cost parts and supplies that are produced all over the world , literally , and then redistributed to basically service this industry , and you can even buy salvaged parts .
luminosity was an issue , when you have too much bright sunlight outside .
i also did — and i don &apos;t want to start a little fight in the next panel — but i did a google share analysis of evolution and natural selection .
the columbia blows up , suddenly there are a lot of searches on columbia .
js : again .
js : now , there &apos;s now a real fancy invention , it &apos;s the one where you wave your hand and it kicks it out .
and i felt very troubled .
but two weeks later , i was in this little town , anandpur sahib , outside chandigarh , the capital of the punjab , and the temple and also next to it the fortress that the last guru of the sikhs , guru gobind , died in as he wrote the khalsa , which is their holy scripture .
and doing that in the u.s.
well , there are other cancer tumors in the abdomen — quite lethal , very lethal actually — pancreas , liver , kidney .
it is a voice of experience .
they inspect it , they check it for cracks , for drill damage , for spalls , for chips .
thank you .
so the culture , the northern aboriginal culture , traditionally has been highly seasonal .
which is appropriate , because actually , this approach is not innovative .
and a couple of things struck me about this .
he looks like this .
we even created a seven-week curriculum on emotion intelligence , which we jokingly call &quot; &quot; searching inside yourself . &quot; &quot; it &apos;s less naughty than it sounds .
( music ) amanda palmer ( singing ) : ground control to major tom , ground control to major tom , take your protein pills and put your helmet on .
tell my wife i love her very much she knows . &quot; &quot; ground control to major tom , your circuit &apos;s dead , there &apos;s something wrong .
never has this number been so high , but actually this is good news , because what it means is people stop dying .
his son will soon be 14 years old .
i started seeking out triathletes because i found that lifelong swimmers often couldn &apos;t teach what they did .
you could jump off the end into the deep end .
it turns out this holds true for other species as well .
and perhaps because these ukrainian women were schooled under the soviets and versed in the russian poets , aphorisms about these ideas slip from their mouths all the time .
meaning , there &apos;s a 99 percent chance that they &apos;ll get away with it .
thank you .
clay shirky , that great chronicler of everything networked , has captured the assumption that this challenges in such a beautiful way .
and it goes on and on .
we &apos;re effectively co-designing their product .
people clearly don &apos;t want to walk all the way around the edge .
now what that tells us is that wall tissues are doing so much more than just covering the vascular tissues .
i tried a bunch of different stuff .
we &apos;ve evolved with tools , and tools have evolved with us .
so the question is , how can we use this ?
i teach at the science leadership academy , which is a partnership school between the franklin institute and the school district of philadelphia .
it asked them to create for themselves , and it allowed them to fail , process , learn from .
and it is about the dirty word &quot; &quot; compromise . &quot; &quot; compromise is not bad .
our emotions are complex .
as we did some of our subsequent expeditions , i was seeing creatures at hydrothermal vents and sometimes things that i had never seen before , sometimes things that no one had seen before , that actually were not described by science at the time that we saw them and imaged them .
but , it struck me how much this dive , these deep dives , was like a space mission .
we witnessed the eruption of violence in the streets .
and i understood , this was their election , and they weren &apos;t going to let anyone take it away from them .
and that is the same reef ; that &apos;s the same reef 15 years ago ; that &apos;s the same reef today .
it was when i was on holiday last early autumn in france .
the earthquake destroyed the capital of port-au-prince , claiming the lives of some 320,000 people , rendering homeless about 1.2 million people .
government institutions were completely decapitated , including the presidential palace .
every single color , dot , every single line , is a weather element .
what i love about this work is that it challenges our assumptions of what kind of visual vocabulary belongs in the world of art , versus science .
song : before god destroyed the people on the earth , he warned noah to build an ark .
because we ’ re far from home , we ’ re very tired . &quot; &quot; and the old lady said , &quot; &quot; oh yes , come on in . &quot; &quot; it was come dark and rain , will make you weary and tired .
not a lot of other diseases have that profile . and you can see here — this is a graph of death rates by age in botswana and egypt .
people really like to have sex .
we so rarely note how different it is from moment to moment , with clouds coming and going .
it opens our hearts , and makes us realize we are a part of nature and we &apos;re not separate from it .
how cheap ?
we say never again , and yet it happens again and again and again .
but we don &apos;t see it on social media , right ?
and i don &apos;t know what the solution is .
and we hope that when we act on global problems in the future we will not only have the heart , we will not only have the money , but we will also use the brain .
hiv has a peak three to six weeks after infection and therefore , having more than one partner in the same month is much more dangerous for hiv than others .
finally , there &apos;s one of evening primrose that bjorn rorslett from norway sent me — fantastic hidden pattern .
i think there &apos;s something poetic here , that these pictures taken with ultraviolet filter , the main use of that filter is for astronomers to take pictures of venus — actually the clouds of venus .
( applause )
and their whole life will be spent taking pieces of many different places and putting them together into a stained glass whole .
and that prompted people to make maps like this , with all kinds of wonderful detail on the land , but when you get to the waters edge , the ocean looks like one giant puddle of blue paint .
he &apos;s like an underwater spiderman .
i &apos;ve been wondering for a long time , since i &apos;ve been thinking about memes a lot , is there a difference between the memes that we copy — the words we speak to each other , the gestures we copy , the human things — and all these technological things around us ?
we &apos;re so used to thinking in terms of biology , we think about genes this way .
and this is happening right now , today .
so in march , 2012 , just one month ago , some researchers reported in the journal nature how they had tried to replicate 53 different basic science studies looking at potential treatment targets in cancer , and out of those 53 studies , they were only able to successfully replicate six .
and that is , there are mirror neurons , just as there are mirror neurons for action , there are mirror neurons for touch .
and i claim that what happened was the sudden emergence of a sophisticated mirror neuron system , which allowed you to emulate and imitate other people &apos;s actions .
who would have thought that two young guys and a start-up would beat out google video ? why ?
the incorporated side , the company , is doing things that it does really well .
i couldn &apos;t leave the story , and i couldn &apos;t leave the topic either , because everywhere i went i met more of these women who no one seemed to know about , or even wish to .
if you see the word &quot; &quot; microfinance , &quot; &quot; what comes to mind ?
like , just a couple of weeks ago , neuroscientists at mit figured out how to break habits in rats just by controlling neural activity in a specific part of their brain .
when the headlines rolled , what happened was , the marketers came calling .
turns out there &apos;s some exceptions to that rule .
well , here &apos;s one possibility .
i never did it .
she &apos;s an active presence in their lives , as well as mine , and is instilling in them the same values that she taught me and my brother : things like compassion , and integrity , and confidence , and perseverance — all of that wrapped up in an unconditional love that only a grandmother can give .
xl : oh . that &apos;s true . so it looks like , hmm , indeed we need to find a better way to impact the brain at the speed of light .
we are trying to shoot lasers into the brain .
and i like this phrase : &quot; &quot; scratch your own itch . &quot; &quot; if you have an idea , you just go and you make it .
so this one is a quadcopter .
( laughter ) this sound colors our first impression of any room ; it can &apos;t be helped .
take-out sandwich shops , film processing drop-offs , peep-shows and necktie stores .
but how do we do that ?
a real airplane that we could finally present .
and he can return to the location where he parked by moving so as to find where it is that best matches the firing pattern of the place cells in his brain currently with the stored pattern where he parked his car .
so if we take some outbound path — perhaps we park and we wander off — we know because our own movements , which we can integrate over this path roughly what the heading direction is to go back .
i also experienced this lesson in sports .
one organization gave them goats and chickens .
and so six years ago , i changed the direction of my career .
so how does multispectral imaging actually work ?
there &apos;s a reason for this , as there is a reason that waldo is hiding . ( laughter )
sliced , diced , peppered , chunked , topped , capped , and covered . ( laughter )
the question is how .
and that is a lot of water .
we have not learned every single rule .
except , i &apos;m not .
i waited to see what he would pull out .
i &apos;ve been a full-time writer now for 34 years .
but let me illustrate that fourth factor by looking at qatar .
so what we can conclude is you don &apos;t have to get rich to have few children .
it was about 115 degrees .
what i mean is with the profits from the first quarter acre , the farmers could buy a second and a third and a fourth .
ca : certainly in the u.s. , you &apos;ve got political gridlock on most issues .
the answer lies over there , in cutting off supply and demand . &quot; &quot; and it hit me : everybody involved in this thought the answer lay in that area about which they knew the least .
it was ubiquitous .
ladies and gentlemen , gather around .
now david attenborough is really a plant lover ; he did some of the most beautiful movies about plant behavior .
you know very well about professors .
and let me say just one more thing before i leave this area of governance .
( applause ) we — as a result , we decided to liberalize many of our markets .
who here knew that &quot; &quot; motel &quot; &quot; was a blend word ?
this is called functional shift .
if some glorious angel suddenly descended through my living room ceiling and offered to take away the children i have and give me other , better children — more polite , funnier , nicer , smarter — i would cling to the children i have and pray away that atrocious spectacle .
and he had a very large head , which she thought might indicate hydrocephalus .
we gradually reduce and eventually stop watering the forest .
the natural system produces by bringing elements together , atom by atom .
it &apos;s a bit like a huge jumping jack , and they have used this in every harbor in the world as a breakwater .
like you &apos;ve heard the other economists say , we are at the point where china was when its boom years began , and that &apos;s where we &apos;re going .
to thrive and survive in my profession , you really have to be a hopeless optimist .
as we humans continue to maintain our role as the leading predator on earth , i &apos;ve witnessed and photographed many of these ripple effects firsthand .
i &apos;m going to suggest that to integrate consciousness into science , some radical ideas may be needed .
science , by its nature , is objective .
and in this context , you can only talk about the probability of finding a certain value of the higgs mass .
our calculations showed that the measured value of the higgs boson mass is very special .
this is a robot that can climb structures .
every day in the morning , the first thing i do before my first cup of coffee , before i brush my teeth , i open my notebook .
( applause )
from eric mazur , i learned about peer instruction , that peers can be the best teachers , because they &apos;re the ones that remember what it &apos;s like to not understand .
i could imagine beautiful housing going up along there without tearing down another tree .
now , retrofits are often accused of being examples of faux downtowns and instant urbanism , and not without reason ; you don &apos;t get much more phony than an astroturf town green .
dm : so , the last example i have time to show you today is a music sequencing and live performance tool that we &apos;ve built recently , in which siftables act as sounds like lead , bass and drums .
so , as you can see , my passion is for making new human-computer interfaces that are a better match to the ways our brains and bodies work .
after a few years , he &apos;s so frustrated he &apos;s ready to give up , but he has an epiphany one day .
and imagine , just consider this idea , if you would : what if we could connect ourselves in this world through a vast network of air and glass ?
that &apos;s more than the emissions from all electricity and industry , or from all the world &apos;s planes , trains and automobiles .
this is work that we &apos;re doing to try to highlight places in the world where we could improve yields without harming the environment .
no more , &quot; &quot; charge before use . &quot; &quot; so why am i telling you this ?
maybe there &apos;s a way to get rid of those . &quot; &quot; so my last piece of advice is to think younger .
now , a quick primer on dna .
if you think about antarctica , it &apos;s technically a desert , it gets so little precipitation .
as many of you know , ibm has always been considered for the last hundred years to be one of the most innovative companies .
the first is what we called sinking skill ladder , and now i &apos;m going to go back to where i started my conversation with you , which was about the flight of jobs .
the difference in the quality of medical care received by people with mental illness is one of the reasons why they live shorter lives than people without mental illness .
well , i think all of you can guess that 12 years on , we &apos;re still nowhere near that goal .
bad enough we had to see j. edgar hoover in a dress .
but then i read in &quot; &quot; dear abby &quot; &quot; that that was rude .
the usual suspects , like saturated fat and sugar , nicotine , opiates , cocaine , too much alcohol and chronic stress .
thank you .
well , according to the governments of the world , yes we can .
bg : thank you very much .
it will actually happen by the powerful coming together and making treaty-based systems , treaty-based agreements , to govern that global space .
for power is not just moving laterally from nation to nation .
holograms are examples of a machine interacting with an environment from an output perspective .
jeff norris : hey , alex .
it &apos;s way above everything that we have ever seen before .
and if you manipulate the speed of this rotor , you are actually able to crack the rotor and eventually even have the centrifuge explode .
and i want to tell you about a project to save plants .
and we decided that what we want to store first of all , are the species that are most under threat .
the reason that they gave about american bombing wasn &apos;t all that far off .
so how did a cambodian family end up in vietnam in 1977 ?
and when we run experiments , we usually hope that one group will behave differently than another .
in my mind , i was actually a knight trying to help science move along .
now , just by being able to go outside on your balcony or on the third floor roof terrace , you can be connected to the outdoors , even when you &apos;re way above the ground plane .
tall buildings don &apos;t necessarily lend themselves to being social buildings .
but let &apos;s just look at sudan , the second-largest country in africa .
you had the creation of new states in eastern europe , the former yugoslav republics and the balkans , and the &apos; stans of central asia .
we &apos;re actually going to make the left , left payoff for the matcher a little bit higher .
the chimps are playing better than the humans , better in the sense of adhering to game theory .
in fact , what they &apos;re suggesting is , stare at awesome black people .
i mean , you just have to do it .
i &apos;m sure there are a lot of data nerds here .
we couldn &apos;t solve this problem with 50 percent of the population on the sidelines .
( applause ) all right , we still have a little ways to go with that , but i think it shows the promise .
my family and i bought our first and only home on december 13 , 2001 , a fixer-upper in a beautiful spot of los altos hills , california , from where i am speaking to you now .
he &apos;s the greatest young conductor in the world .
he has given us the possibility to have dreams and to make true the dreams .
so , we all know about the narmada river , the tragedies of dams , the tragedies of huge projects which displace people and wreck river systems without providing livelihoods .
you &apos;ve all heard , perhaps , of project tiger which started back in the early &apos; 70s , which was , in fact , a very dynamic time for conservation .
let me show you one more .
strings attached to dancers .
the european 20-20-20 plan is an amazing breakthrough , something that should make all of us feel that hope is on the horizon .
their fitness for creating pandemics we are unaware of , but we are ripe for zoonotic-borne , emerging communicable diseases .
snipers , loyal to the government , started firing on the civilians and protesters on institutskaya street .
glory to heroes . &quot; &quot; thank you .
my name is tom , and i &apos;ve come here today to come clean about what i do for money .
( music ) ( applause ) i got way too much time on my hands .
well , we &apos;re working on it , but here is a challenge .
like , the reason that i asked you to do that is because you really feel your brain cringing , right ?
then what the hell are you , what are the hell are we doing ?
it &apos;s the politics that &apos;s hard , indeed impossibly hard , because this reform would shrink k street , and capitol hill , as congressman jim cooper , a democrat from tennessee , put it , has become a farm league for k street , a farm league for k street .
( applause )
is it really just us ?
and what &apos;s really important about dental calculus is that it fossilizes just like the rest of the skeleton , it &apos;s abundant in quantity before the present day and it &apos;s ubiquitous worldwide .
many of you may know it by the term tartar .
single mother , hiv positive .
when she got up to make tea , she placed him in my own lap and i had never felt a child that was that emaciated .
the original is typically the product of a creative act , the forgery isn &apos;t .
sufferers of capgras syndrome believe that the people they love most in the world have been replaced by perfect duplicates .
( applause )
this is another case where a theoretical paradigm in biology really worked — was the germ theory of disease .
&quot; charlie , why are you so pessimistic ? &quot;
three out of 10 . that &apos;s not good .
how do sharing and transactions go together ?
i think about this every time i see a red miata go by .
( laughter ) ( applause ) thank you ! thank you !
as a body architect , i fascinate with the human body and explore how i can transform it .
there &apos;s so little compromise on this , you can &apos;t see it .
what &apos;s incredible about this , and the way i love to come back to it , is this is taking something that you hate or bores you , folding clothes , and if you can actually do this — who can actually do this ? anybody try to do this ?
it lasts forever . it &apos;s a very strange medium .
i &apos;m , like , how did this happen , kind of thing ?
( laughter ) well , this is a deep-sea version of women &apos;s lib .
that terminology has stuck , but it doesn &apos;t actually refer to specific chemicals because these chemicals come in a lot of different shapes and forms .
a lot of my work draws on the scientific research , so this pays homage to the maze experiment but in a different way .
quite clever .
that was john kerry &apos;s home state .
here is the same data on a map .
person a : ivy league , 4.0 , flawless resume , great recommendations .
i know a lot about this because i am a scrapper .
and hopefully inspire people to go to that website .
so originally i was going to go to india .
a child in malawi , for example , she might have 12 episodes of malaria before the age of two , but if she survives , she &apos;ll continue to get malaria throughout her life , but she &apos;s much less likely to die of it .
they had so much faith in their tools that they stopped doing malaria research .
an enormous number .
sixty-five percent of these fisheries , globally , are badly managed .
and it reminded me that — to keep in the present , to look out for these kinds of things .
it &apos;s a comment on the way in which we deal with public seating in the city of new york .
you take a nozzle and you create 10 random variations on the nozzle .
i do not want to have my conclusions tested . &quot; &quot; it feels so much more comfortable simply to lay down the law .
it &apos;s quite interesting , isn &apos;t it ?
but they did recover quite fast afterwards .
afghans have become deeply internationalist .
i think we can make it , and the reason we can make it is because of the people .
conversely , there is no concentration at which the sulfur compound will smell like vodka .
the lush heart note , melaleuca bark note — which does not contain any melaleuca bark , because it ’ s totally forbidden .
and the studio executives , they would say , &quot; hey , look at shekhar . he &apos;s so prepared . &quot;
it doesn &apos;t come into my frame of reference . &quot; &quot; so , how far does eternity go ?
the next show that i &apos;m going to work on — and i &apos;ve been bugging a lot of you about this here — is about the relationship between design and science .
and other examples : this was marti guixe about working on the go , and hella jongerius , my favorite , about how to work at home .
so this goes on in the formal economy as well as the informal economy , so it &apos;s wrong of us to blame — and i &apos;m not singling out siemens , i &apos;m saying everyone does it . okay ?
so procter &amp; gamble says , &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t care whether a store is incorporated or registered or anything like that .
in some way , god must feel the anguish , and grief , and physical pain that we feel .
i very much relate to this idea of god .
we talk about the curse of information overload .
so right now , in this world , we think about data as being this curse .
so we have portal because you shoot walls in order to create new spaces .
i would like to do the same with video games .
but , that said , something kind of peculiar has happened recently in my life and in my career , which has caused me to have to recalibrate my whole relationship with this work .
and , if this is true , and i think it is true , the question becomes , what now ?
one , two , three , four children per woman : six , seven , eight children per woman .
they get samsung , how can they be &#91; a &#93; developing country ?
the challenge , of course , is to answer this question : what permits this extraordinary performance of animals that allows them basically to go anywhere ?
so , in conclusion , i think the message is clear .
we build on that and we take people , hopefully , to the operating room where they learn to be an assistant .
and i think that we can develop some tools to do so .
these were all undetected by normal thresholds which would be applied to data .
so what we did is we took a data system which we run every two weeks of the year in formula 1 and we installed it on the hospital computers at birmingham children &apos;s hospital .
when the architects came , they brought us these things , and you &apos;ve probably seen things like this .
the beautiful canvas and rubber skylights got eaten by the sun in six months .
this is a provocative question .
so let &apos;s try another test .
but the truth is nobody really knows , and that &apos;s the point .
there are no 72 virgins in the koran .
he was home alone a lot .
my brother , henry , he died tragically when we were teenagers .
all : one-two-three-four , one-two-three-four , one-two-three-four , ah .
a-rhythm-etic .
interpreter : by making myself invisible , i try to explore and question the contradictory and often inter-canceling relationship between our civilization and its development .
because global temperatures rise , the sea level rises , and it is said thatvenice will disappear in the coming decades .
i don &apos;t think this is the answer he was looking for .
so the story that the media told about the 36 questions was that there might be a shortcut to falling in love .
( laughter ) ( applause ) you &apos;re very charitable , generous people .
now , a single trematode is tiny , microscopic , but collectively they weighed as much as all the fish in the estuaries and three to nine times more than all the birds .
long legs that allow heat to escape .
i don &apos;t know why that would be , but it works for them .
one of the other ideas that comes around is that you have a different type of time on every single device that you use .
whether you like it or not , you &apos;re starting to show up online , and people are interacting with your second self when you &apos;re not there .
let me start again .
and we sort of started talking about what it is that they wanted .
for most africans today , where you live , or where you were born , and the circumstances under which you were born , determine the rest of your life .
i mean , we need a whole conference just devoted to telling the good stories about the continent .
and this was the first thing she did .
they are 12 ft. long , a thousand pounds .
ss : but since i &apos;m advised not to do what i normally do , i haven &apos;t told you that these apes have language .
( music ) video : narrator : by raising bonobos in a culture that is both bonobo and human , and documenting their development across two decades , scientists are exploring how cultural forces ( laughter ) may have operated during human evolution .
( applause )
the infinity burial project , an alternative burial system that uses mushrooms to decompose and clean toxins in bodies . the infinity burial project
next step in my process .
so this little slide here shows you an optometrist and the little blue person represents about 10,000 people and that &apos;s the ratio in the u.k.
but we &apos;ve kind of lacked imagination in how we could do that well or interestingly .
it is in your interests that i &apos;m healthy , happy , well-fed .
and at the same time , alcohol is highly flammable .
it goes really fast , and it &apos;s not that impressive .
but scientists should surely be precautionary about experiments that generate conditions without precedent in the natural world .
within a few decades , millions will have the capability to misuse rapidly advancing biotech , just as they misuse cybertech today .
if i could start , this is the enigma decoding machine .
spectroscopy , that was another one .
you can have me as a farmer , or in leathers , and no one has ever chose farmer .
she did it for three years .
the finished project is meant to be more than just a power station .
jc : thank you , thomas .
so this was television , this was all different types of media saying , &quot; we are saving a place for you . &quot;
these trees helped us demobilize 331 guerrillas , roughly five percent of the guerrilla force at the time .
and that &apos;s the powerful men . we have to meet and to talk to them .
we heard that now from the east again the war started , and it &apos;s going fast .
he wrote about my strengths , weaknesses , and gentle suggestions for improvement , quoting specific incidents , and held a mirror to my life .
there are times when i want to trade all those years that i was too busy to sit with my dad and chat with him , and trade all those years for one hug .
so you see the massive increase of the black dots representing the new neurons-to-be .
and what we &apos;ve known already for very long , is that this is important for learning , memory , mood and emotion .
we &apos;re not doing anything to the cells here .
remember you have these 10 times or more bacterial cells in you or on you , keeping you healthy .
now , my second example is for a slightly younger crowd .
the first is 4shbab .
anyway , i &apos;m blabbering on here .
it was a big thing for us , and now all my sisters are off having babies and the boys are all getting married , so we &apos;re staying close to home for , i guess , another couple of weeks .
you can see how old this stuff is .
that &apos;s david letterman .
so we came up with a radical , almost insane idea .
what would you do here ?
now i started drawing in the middle of a lot of chaos .
my parents got divorced , and my sister was arrested .
people say we should call it the fiscal slope , or we should call it an austerity crisis , but then other people say , no , that &apos;s even more partisan .
but that system has tons of problems .
but it wasn &apos;t that simple . because by the time i got out of that unit , i was not functional at all .
and he asked to meet with the senior staff , and they agreed to meet with him because he was very well thought of in that place .
for me , a place to begin healing the souls of those affected by war and disease is by creating comfortable and affordable interfaces for their bodies .
thank you very much .
and because of those words , i would wake up at the crack of dawn , and because of those words , i would love school more than anything , and because of those words , when i was on a bus going to school , i dreamed the biggest dreams .
she was the kind of person who got to be the way she was because she was a single mom with six kids in chicago .
so , you start with the darkest one .
and the idea was to create some self-moving benches in the main exhibition room .
with brainstorming we make you happy , we play games , and we say , &quot; &quot; no criticism , &quot; &quot; and you get all these weird , neat ideas .
now i &apos;m going to put the plank 300 feet in the air — and i &apos;m not going to go near it , thank you .
so when designers are working on ideas , they can start building stuff whenever they want .
but a place , i think , where the effort is really worthwhile is where people are wrestling with quite serious problems — things like education or security or finance or health .
imagine that that earth is at the center of the universe , and surrounding it is the sky projected onto a sphere .
thanks very much .
but there are still over 650 million indians , pakistanis , sri lankans , bangladeshis , nepalese , who remain washed up on the shores of poverty .
we are but two threads cut from the same cloth .
i &apos;ve also learned so much from these interviews .
he passed away very suddenly a few days later .
just know that it is enough sometimes to know that it is difficult . &quot; &quot; of course , talking about goats makes me think of sheep , and not in good ways .
but when we were in lisbon , in the airport , about to fly to england , this woman saw my mother wearing this dress , which had been washed so many times it was basically see through , with five really hungry-looking kids , came over and asked her what had happened .
none of the haikus were written by the same person .
i mean — no , i mean like in the ted sense ?
but the new yorker only can take 16 or 17 cartoons , and we have 1,000 cartoons .
actually , that &apos;s ridiculous , because when it comes to humor , 75 percent is really absolutely the best you can hope for .
to put that in perspective , a 23 percent increase is like trading in your 1980 chevy citation for a 1980 chevrolet corvette .
we added weights to their ankles that amounted to 15 percent of their body weight .

and so if you looked at my brain , or any brain that &apos;s infected with a viral memetic infection like this , and compared it to anyone in this room , or anyone who uses critical thinking on a regular basis , i am convinced it would look very , very different .
pp : ♪ they believe . ♪ ( screams ) ( music ) ( applause ) jt : ohhhh . what was that ?
the audience is willing to say , &quot; &quot; oh , i know that &apos;s not a real sun .
both models improve .

and think about what they might be telling you .
and this is a commercially available device .
the shared spaces are also treated in the same manner , where walls are decorated in faux marble patterns .
there are the retail shops , the cafes and the restaurants , and the community is this community of coptic christians , so you &apos;ll also find a church , along with the scores of religious iconographies throughout the area , and also all the everyday services like the electronic repair shops , the barbers , everything .

muzetta &apos;s family give the lie to this .

it manifests in each individual differently , hence why remi is so different from sam .
the country — the home of biological . and putting them together .
shoes for nike , where the uppers are polyesters , infinitely recyclable , the bottoms are biodegradable soles .
&quot; why did we want to meet her ? &quot;
and i saw phyllis , and i watched her .
so a young girl , a 23-year-old student , boarded a bus in delhi with her male friend .
three , i realized for the first time that my voice mattered .
i woke up in the middle of the night with the sound of heavy explosion .
she said , &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s not fair , because there is only one life , and there should only be one death . &quot; &quot; we have been only seeing one side of war .
women who think they &apos;re overweight — again , regardless of whether they are or are not — have higher rates of absenteeism .
these six things are crucial starting points for anyone serious about delivering body-confidence education that works .
it only takes a few minutes to put on and for the signals to settle .
but with the limited time we have available , i &apos;d like to show you the cognitive suite , which is the ability for you to basically move virtual objects with your mind .

now , what has bonded our team over the years is the idea of democratizing access to satellite information .
what &apos;s the problem ?
a protease that had eluded determination for over 10 years was solved was by three players in a matter of days , perhaps the first major scientific advance to come from playing a video game .
the imperative is not to figure out how to compute , but what to compute . how do you impose human intuition on data at this scale ?
a 1930s ship &apos;s lifeboat , which i &apos;ve been restoring in the garden of my beach house in england .
she was with me on my lifeboat .
but the day after he got an lfc , he hopped in it , rode that kilometer , opened up his shop and soon after landed a contract to make school uniforms and started making money , started providing for his family again .
so as a wet-behind-the-ears student , excited , our team made a prototype , brought that prototype to tanzania , kenya and vietnam in 2008 , and found it was terrible because we didn &apos;t get enough input from users .
self-study , self-exploration , self-empowerment : these are the virtues of a great education .
courage , according to churchill , is the ability to go from one defeat to another without losing enthusiasm . ( laughter ) and &#91; joyce &#93; said that mistakes are the portals of discovery .
plasticity means that there was always hope for our reason — hope for our ability to rebuild that function .

you don &apos;t master feeling lousy about one thing .
so i don &apos;t really know that . i don &apos;t really — actually i do my own kind of research , you know .
in summary , instead of our students learning about the techniques of calculus , i think it would be far more significant if all of them knew what two standard deviations from the mean means . and i mean it .
on the other hand , statistics — that &apos;s a subject that you could , and should , use on daily basis . right ?
have you ever made a small , weird sound when you remembered something embarrassing ?
( laughter ) has your phone ever run out of battery in the middle of an argument , and it sort of felt like the phone was breaking up with both of you ?
so office workers became programmers of spreadsheets .
it feels the force , understands that chris is there and doesn &apos;t push through him and hurt him .

let &apos;s have a chat later .
raise your hand if you are a snake .
we &apos;re going to bring on the neuro-revolution .
do you feel that a little bit ? mg : nope .
why didn &apos;t you just call it the constitution so i knew what you were talking about ?
it &apos;s wonderful .
but the trouble is , it kept on tipping over , but — ( laughter ) ca : designed by philippe starck perhaps ?
ca : post-napster , you &apos;re looking like a bit of a genius , actually , for that as well .
and in most information boxes , there &apos;s data .

many students , k-12 and in universities , don &apos;t want to just sit there and listen to somebody talk .
and hopefully from that i get to learn something .
more on that later .
