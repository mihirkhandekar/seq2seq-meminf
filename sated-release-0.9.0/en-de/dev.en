i &apos;d like for you to picture it in your mind .
so the next time you &apos;re faced with something that &apos;s unexpected , unwanted and uncertain , consider that it just may be a gift .
now of course , all this data — and one of you is going to do this , right ?
what if there was an app for that ?
since there is no real retribution possible that would make any difference , since there are people willing to actually give up their lives in order to do a lot of damage to us , it becomes apparent that the whole notion of this mutually assured destruction would not work .

all of that occurs within working memory .
in my organization we now do this on a regular basis to identify the causes of outbreaks that are unclear exactly what causes them .
beijerinck and his kind provide an important lesson for the next generation of explorers — people like that young girl from beloit , wisconsin .

the white lines are what &apos;s called an advance fuel cycle , where you reprocess .
and then when you look at this , you say , &quot; &quot; that &apos;s a tooth .

this is one of my favorites .
and if you want to go back and read the book again , you just fold it back up and put it back on the page .
three million set aside , 62 billion dollar liability — much worse than the car companies .

they can grow so big , blocking all daylight , making it very dark and ominous standing under them .
what really excites me about these storms is their movement , the way they swirl and spin and undulate , with their lava lamp-like mammatus clouds .
and excessive use of antibiotics , in particular in children , has been shown to be associated with , again , risk factors for obesity , for autoimmune diseases , for a variety of problems that are probably due to disruption of the microbial community .

in 1962 , buckminster fuller presented the particularly audacious proposal for the geoscope .
it keeps playing out in all of our minds .

that three-year-old girl is still part of you .
they settled in a shady suburb about an hour east of toronto , and they settled into a new life .
it just all depends on one &apos;s perception .

it was the worst winds i &apos;ve ever seen .
genes send the instructions to make proteins .
and then we find some outliers , some things that lie beyond the cloud .
each of these is about a relationship , and this is a 24 / 7 connected world . once you get my cell phone number , you can literally be in touch with me 24 hours a day .
what does that mean ? what &apos;s the next big idea from that ?
and so it &apos;s really important not to use the term gmo because it &apos;s scientifically meaningless .
for this reason , farmers plant rice varieties that carry genes for resistance .
when that ice melts , sea level rises by six meters .

make sure you still have them .
mm : the medium does things to people and they are always completely unaware of this .
talk about a shot in the arm for the computer industry .
i took this picture because this turns out to be the first coffeehouse to open in england in 1650 .
you would drink a little beer with breakfast and have a little wine at lunch , a little gin — particularly around 1650 — and top it off with a little beer and wine at the end of the day .
and we can walk through the reasons for that , but basically the small cell took on the order of one to two months to get results from , whereas the larger , faster-growing cell takes only two days .
so early on , we developed the notion of putting in watermarks in the dna to absolutely make clear that the dna was synthetic .
and so abc and sony have devised this new thing where when you step in the line in the supermarket — initially it &apos;ll be safeways . it is safeways ; they &apos;re trying this in three parts of the country right now — you &apos;ll be watching tv .

it turned what could have been seven of the grimmest years of our life into seven of the most glorious .
i mean , let me clarify something right here .
well , the really cool thing is that most ceos are .
but this is transforming 99 percent of the kids who get this .
no more are we going to accept this . &quot; &quot; and we want to tell our grandchildren that there was a terrible time in history where up to a third of the children had brains and bodies that were stunted , but that exists no more .
as they do so , they transport fertilizer in the form of their feces from places that have it to places that need it .
unfortunately , many people still think that whale conservationists like myself do what we do only because these creatures are charismatic and beautiful .
first of all , because we can &apos;t shape what we don &apos;t understand , and what we don &apos;t understand and use ends up shaping us .
&#91; &quot; &quot; paper speakers &quot; &quot; &#93; what we &apos;re seeing here is just a piece of paper with some copper tape on it connected to an mp3 player and a magnet .
and we could have been born 100,000 years ago .
lower left is day-of-the-dead toys .
the three of us take this class together .
this is the complication .
but you know , at a local level , you scale ; everybody in this room is scaled .
this is just european countries , but you do it in japan or china or colombia , always the same with the same kind of economy of scale to the same degree .
now , if life had originated on europa in the ocean , it could also have moved out onto the surface .
none of these things is likely , but my , my philosophy is , look for what &apos;s detectable , not for what &apos;s probable .
the modern sailplane is superbly efficient .
it &apos;s part of a long-term program nasa sponsored .
in the question of consciousness and artificial intelligence , artificial intelligence has really , like the study of consciousness , gotten nowhere . we have no idea how consciousness works .
gas , you can &apos;t see that .
people would keep talking about it for weeks .
so i think we should shatter some of our utopian assumptions and actually start doing something about it .
taking my arm , leaning lightly against me .
weightfully this self which graced the world yet never wholly itself .
and this is something , by the way , that i think is going to be a challenge for our entire field .
let &apos;s try something different . and here &apos;s the rub .
now , bad weather comes in , just land , fold up the wings , drive home .
still , we very much wanted to see the aircraft that we &apos;d all helped build in the air , off the ground , like it was supposed to be .
and i was scared . ( laughter ) really scared . scared of these students with their big brains and their big books and their big , unfamiliar words .
and when you &apos;re describing your science , beware of jargon .
you begin to look at things having to do with your tensions .
and what i need , in effect , is a focus .
i loved her , and then she went out into that strange , alien land .
( laughter ) but it was also the tone of how she asked the question : apropos of nothing , like she didn &apos;t even care about the answer , as though she just wanted to talk to me .
and this requires a stable hand , so this is why i decided to do it onstage in front of a thousand people .
it &apos;s edible , so you can do smart packaging around food that you can cook with the food .
so all of these wi-fi – enabled robots actually learn from each other .
this allows you to drag and drop these blocks of semantic code and create any behavior for this robot you want .
don &apos;t you in the front row worry or anything .
so let &apos;s start with care anywhere .
wherever we look , it &apos;s observable : in the biosphere , in the atmosphere , in the ocean , showing these super-exponential trajectories characterizing an unsustainable path and announcing a phase transition .

it &apos;s called &quot; &quot; untitled &quot; &quot; and i think that &apos;s appropriate .
see , they were connected around something , just like our ancestors who evolved their social cognitions telling stories around the campfire .
now what you &apos;re seeing is called augmented reality , but to me , it &apos;s part of a much more important story — a story of how we can begin to extend our bodies with digital devices , instead of the other way around .
third , someone has something you &apos;ve never even heard of before .
your voice is small , but don &apos;t ever stop singing .
( applause ) it &apos;s a &quot; &quot; feel the fear and do it anyway &quot; &quot; kind of thing .
it &apos;s called &quot; &quot; tembererana . &quot; &quot; and the song is based on what i think was my first childhood attempts to think about invisible forces .
they were opening biohacker spaces , and some of them were facing much greater challenges than we did , more regulations , less resources .

no one wants to go on flolan .
a few days after arriving , i met this wonderful , old conductor who started casting me in all of these roles .
the u.n. ran headfirst into a problem that the majority of the world &apos;s populous faces : not having detailed maps .

why did they go ? the cynical answer is they went because president kennedy wanted to show the soviets that his nation had the better rockets .
why choose this as our goal ?
i become the hat after my own gigs , but i have to physically stand there and take the help from people , and unlike the guy in the opening band , i &apos;ve actually had a lot of practice standing there .
we sign with a major label .
weird , no one dances . we &apos;re two guys doing this . ( laughter ) i think that &apos;s uncomfortable for everyone .

( laughter ) ( applause ) &quot; &quot; house of cards &quot; &quot; gets a 9.1 rating on this curve , so it &apos;s exactly where they wanted it to be .
( audience : &quot; &quot; alpha house . &quot; &quot; ) yes , &quot; &quot; alpha house , &quot; &quot; but it seems like not too many of you here remember that show , actually , because it didn &apos;t turn out that great .
you can ask people about their likes and dislikes , their basic preferences .
it transforms our preferences .
my friend andy cavatorta was building a robotic harp for bjork &apos;s biophilia tour and i wound up building the electronics and motion control software to make the harps move and play music .
i mean , our hands and our minds are optimized to think about and interact with tangible objects .
pharmaceutical production is already under way in major laboratories using microbes .
most people don &apos;t realize it , because they &apos;re invisible , but microbes make up about a half of the earth &apos;s biomass , whereas all animals only make up about one one-thousandth of all the biomass .
i took up the little baby , massaged her , forced her to drink until she finally started breathing normally .
that changed my life quite dramatically , and as of today , i have almost 1,000 babies in my two centers .
bob &apos;s on the table , and we take this sort of small needle , you know , not too big .
and we have a flexible , powered catheter with a special wire loop tip that stays inside the crunchy part of the marrow and follows the contours of the hip , as it moves around .
but if you got attacked , that was something you could do something about .
because i could go on for about two hours with evidence of people &apos;s inability to estimate odds and inability to estimate value .
the younger face gets happier and happier , saving nothing .
they &apos;re making more money while retired than they were making while they were working .
it seems to me that there is this latent potential everywhere , all around us .
and so this basically led me to a subject called cymatics .
&quot; &quot; on the other hand , i don &apos;t have to get up at four every single morning to milk my labrador . &quot; &quot; this is a recent cover of new york magazine .
after the breathtaking green-haired rosa is murdered , the doctors preserve her with unguents and morticians &apos; paste .

he stayed late at night every day .
the book designer &apos;s responsibility is threefold : to the reader , to the publisher and , most of all , to the author .
the stories can be anything , and some of them are actually true .
they have to — typically , they come three times .
and you &apos;d plug it in there .
now the video games industry is far and away the fastest growing of all modern media .
at the other end of the scale , the game farmville that you may well have heard of , has 70 million players around the world and most of these players are playing it almost every day .
but then our leader , pete , set the vision , and talked to us just like we were his new team .
no , i don &apos;t think anybody would blame me , but pete has inspired us to wake up every morning and be positive and proactive .
we respond to stories more than data .
and we rely on others . we rely on proxies .
not to mention , there &apos;s a patent battle going on , so even if you do invent something , the broad institute and uc berkeley are in this incredible patent battle .
i &apos;m starting to get emails from people that say stuff like , &quot; &quot; hey , can i come to your open night and , like , maybe use crispr and engineer my genome ? &quot; &quot; ( laugher ) like , seriously .
a thousand years from now , people are still doing this .
she was a grad student in the library sciences department .
and this is an analogy for today &apos;s construction and manufacturing world with brute-force assembly techniques .
this is a completely programmable and adaptive pipe on its own .
and the fellow in the vest there , craig toten , he has pushed forward to get documentation out to all the groups that are doing this .
to make sure these buildings are safe , it &apos;s not going to take policy — it &apos;s going to take reaching out to the masons on the ground and helping them learn the proper techniques .
imagine what we all could do if we all came up with simple solutions .
so he told me , &quot; well , let me show you how i do it . &quot;
babies are born to interpenetrate into mom &apos;s mind and to download what they find — their models of how to understand reality .
the unconscious mind hungers for those moments of transcendence , when the skull line disappears and we are lost in a challenge or a task — when a craftsman feels lost in his craft , when a naturalist feels at one with nature , when a believer feels at one with god &apos;s love .
and right at the top , faith and patience .
and i wanted them to be able to shoot from the outside .
so everywhere we went , we auditioned amateurs .
my challenge to the rest of the world is please , start using positive middle eastern images in your stories .
probably too much — i probably obsess over it .
imagine you gave this different premium shelf space on app stores .
we &apos;ve created a tool kit which also lives at brigade.codeforamerica.org , and we will support you along the way .
so keep that in mind .
common injuries can lead to decades of pain , until our joints quite literally grind to a halt .
thank you very much .
and the americans who are in the room , are you not afraid that your presidents are going to govern on the basis of what they said in the primary elections ?
the content doesn &apos;t matter anymore , the problem is the media .
it &apos;s going to be machine-readable .
but there &apos;s a unity of some sort that &apos;s starting to emerge .
one day , my daughter tybee , tybee came to me , and she said , &quot; &quot; i have so much love for you in my body , daddy , i can &apos;t stop giving you hugs and kisses .

we &apos;ve lost a lot of paradise .
there &apos;s some magical amount . i don &apos;t know what it is .
third : escalation of expectations .
or if you are a teacher , you &apos;ll love unesco , and so on .
but it &apos;s not really that easy , that it &apos;s all a good story .
these are tools and techniques that date to the bronze age , and it &apos;s why many farmers are still very poor .
let &apos;s engage our collective passion for problem-solving and figure out what those levers are .
nt : yes , that was a big mistake .
on a dark and stormy night — really ! — it was the 10th of july , 1856 .
i remember march the 15th , 2000 .
it was taken by kevin carter who went to the sudan to document their famine there .
why are we spending $ 135 billion ?
bosnia and kosovo were signal successes , great successes .
and it &apos;s serving 52,000 villages , which represent about 80 million people .
it empowered authorities , and , as a result , marginalized citizens .
you will have come in contact with some of them .
and , just to kind of tear down a myth here , lots of people think that when you get infected with a computer virus , it &apos;s because you went to a porn site .
and so i &apos;m thinking , right , great , it &apos;s going to keep going down .
turns out we kind of do a reasonable job .
dna researcher andrew hessel has pointed out quite rightly that if you can use cancer treatments , modern cancer treatments , to go after one cell while leaving all the other cells around it intact , then you can also go after any one person &apos;s cell .
they had access to satellite imagery .
having made that decision they came to the united states , home of liberal arts education , to talk with some of us most closely identified with that kind of education .
that is where you come in .

it &apos;s just the persians who aren &apos;t fully human and don &apos;t deserve to be treated very nicely .
2,500 years ago , members of one greek city-state considered members of another greek city-state subhuman and treated them that way . and then this moral revolution arrived , and they decided that actually , no , greeks are human beings .
voice 2 : it &apos;s coming again ?

he too was broke , and he had no connections to international terrorist groups .
never another attack on american soil .
and so my plan , and unfortunately i haven &apos;t been able to get my partners at this point to let me announce them , but is to do this with a stationary satellite .

i don &apos;t have to be paying attention to what i hear .
and learning modulation and control is deteriorating .
you wouldn &apos;t want to say something off-the-cuff that might be used against you . &quot; &quot; this is a doctor , whose life is caring for people .
but the direct costs are really only the tip of the iceberg .
now , that kind of slavery is , again , pretty much what slavery has been all through human history .
so , i began to do a research project of my own .
at 4 : 04 the next day , we gave out $ 404 in cash .

and we were able to dig up , when we got old enough , fossils such as this , a slender-snouted crocodile .
but i think , with ingenuity we could see desalination , i think we could reinvest in energy , so that we can actually get better outcomes .
it &apos;s really essential here that we understand that fundamentally the critique is not for economic growth per se but what has happened to capitalism .
why ? because of poor emotional hygiene .

those females , they &apos;re not trying to .

when we submitted it for the swedish competition we thought it was a really cool scheme , but it didn &apos;t exactly look like something from the north of sweden .
and there is an automatic irrigation system that makes sure that this sort of landscape of gardens , in one or two years it will sort of transform into a cambodian temple ruin , completely covered in green .
and third , layers of those rocks must be naturally exposed .
thank you .
and it &apos;s just limestone , nothing really special about it .
nature didn &apos;t need to because , unlike the abalone shell , the survival of a species didn &apos;t depend on building those materials , until maybe now when it might just matter .
in umar &apos;s home country of nigeria , a 95 percent reduction in the number of children paralyzed by polio last year .
so it was a massive effort .
but i &apos;ll have to backtrack a little first .
in what language ? certainly not the language of mathematics , in which , galileo rightly said , the book of nature is written .
it &apos;s great . lots of no is released .
very complex processes with very complex chemicals that fit into very complex receptors .
it &apos;s over 300 million molecular weight .
so , this is the publication we had just a short while ago .
thank you .
play &apos;s essential .
my family was on a road trip and we were in the grand canyon .
because what stem cells are — they &apos;re these phenomenal cells that really have the ability to differentiate into any type of tissue .

there &apos;s a high stakes in the two possibilities of having a dishonest officer or an honest officer .
one way of thinking about it is to imagine what it would be like if language — where it could only be used literally .
they can perform gymnastic maneuvers like no robot we have yet .
the animals rapidly invert and disappear in less than 150 milliseconds — you never see them — using the same structures that they use to run , their legs .
can we see it in full 3d ?
so , superman can fly .
there &apos;s a world of beauty and efficiency to explore here using nature as a design tool .
the idea is we create this long hedge of greenhouses facing the wind .
we use this phrase &quot; &quot; workarounds &quot; &quot; a lot , sort of , looking around us . i was actually looking around the ted and just watching all of these kind of things happen while i &apos;ve been here .
these guys are using this very successfully .
one is in nomadic , hunter-gather societies that often shift camp and that are physically incapable of transporting old people who can &apos;t walk when the able-bodied younger people already have to carry their young children and all their physical possessions .
their old people had to do it to their own parents , and the old people know what now is going to happen to them .
you prune away the weaker branches so that the remaining , important branches , can grow stronger , and this process , which effectively fine-tunes brain tissue according to the species-specific environment , is happening in prefrontal cortex and in other brain regions during the period of human adolescence .
so if you have a teenage son or a daughter and you sometimes think they have problems taking other people &apos;s perspectives , you &apos;re right . they do . and this is why .
but they are ours for the taking — simple examples of the vast under-utilized healthcare resources that , if we reclaimed and redeployed , could realize our most basic aspiration of healthcare .
how is it that if for decades we had a pretty straightforward tool for keeping patients , and especially low-income patients , healthy , that we didn &apos;t use it ?
bg : i would like your comment on something that was in newspapers this morning .

this delusion is a kind of prison for us , restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us .
chris and i were really amazed by the potential now with modern web browsers , where you have html5 audio and video and the power of javascript to render amazingly fast .
it &apos;s that an interface can be a powerful narrative device .
each of us , of course , contains two human genomes — one from our mothers and one from our fathers .
but we do find it in papua new guinea and in other islands in melanesia and the pacific .
we &apos;re harming ourselves around the world , as well as harming the animals , as well as harming nature herself — mother nature , that brought us into being ; mother nature , where i believe we need to spend time , where there &apos;s trees and flowers and birds for our good psychological development .
didn &apos;t they know what was happening ?
so , we &apos;ve been doing this experiment for 15 years , and we see the stars go all the way around .

photography has been my passion ever since i was old enough to pick up a camera , but today i want to share with you the 15 most treasured photos of mine , and i didn &apos;t take any of them .

the second reason is because of our technology .
but wait — wasn &apos;t the paper that sparked the controversy about autism and vaccines debunked , retracted , and branded a deliberate fraud by the british medical journal ?
for most of the 20th century , autism was considered an incredibly rare condition .
when you change your mind about stress , you can change your body &apos;s response to stress .
how about a moderate amount of stress ?
this is stephen hawking &apos;s universe .
and let me end by saying that sound moves in all directions , and so do ideas .
so the problem is : as you add more features , where are they going to go ?
it could be the design of the thing you &apos;re using .
so this is telling us that the fermentation is in full swing .
and i use a heat mat to sit the bath on and a thermostat to regulate it .
she &apos;d lie beside me and say , &quot; &quot; auntie , i wish to be well .
this young woman wished for other things to happen , it happened for her .
( laughter ) now that is true . that is what homeopathy is all about .
what is homeopathy ?

( cheering ) my parents were radicals — ( laughter ) who became , well , grown-ups .
let us turn to afghanistan .
it was black or white .
and every time they do that , they get a tiny little packet of energy .
and speed of activity , which is something that we face in our work with sub-surface organisms , because they grow very , very slowly .
so , let &apos;s see .
and the way that they did this was they would only feature girls on the boxes or in the commercials , and there would be flowery prints all over the ovens and it would be in bright pink and purple , very gender-specific colors to females , right ?

here is a box filled at one and a half atmospheres of atmospheric pressure , with a cloud and with very bright light .
they need your empathy .
we , as a society , we have phds in victimizing a victim .
so we have achieved an awful lot relative to the 20th century , and yet far too little relative to the gravity of the crime that is unfolding as we sit here , as we speak .
and recently , or now not that recently , about six months ago , the authorization of a peacekeeping force of 26,000 that will go .
we used the stone plates as a grid for our little piece .
after two weeks , three weeks , four weeks , five weeks .
like the first two industrial revolutions , the full implications of the new machine age are going to take at least a century to fully play out , but they are staggering .
if anything , all these numbers actually understate our progress , because the new machine age is more about knowledge creation than just physical production .
the truth of social entropy .
here you see submissive gestures from two members of very closely related species .
look at that beautiful thing chiho showed us . she scared us with the lava man .
i feel it &apos;s sort of like the vimalakirti sutra , an ancient work from ancient india in which the buddha appears at the beginning and a whole bunch of people come to see him from the biggest city in the area , vaishali , and they bring some sort of jeweled parasols to make an offering to him .

the one-eyed monkey recognized the woman , a sekhri .
there is , in fact , another stage .
now , again , we don &apos;t often deal with stage one .
we also are going to need political innovation .
this set off a cycle of what we can call political innovation , which led eventually to the idea of consent of the governed — which was implemented for the first time by that radical revolutionary government in america across the pond .
( applause )
thank you very much .
because i could build a pop-up metropolis .
people like my grandparents .

when the last of the survivors were finally picked up by two passing ships , less than half of the men were left alive , and some of them had resorted to their own form of cannibalism .
they weren &apos;t sued because there was carcinogens in the chicken , but they were sued because of california &apos;s proposition 65 , which stated that if there &apos;s anything dangerous in the products then the companies had to give a clear warning .
good plan .
local conflicts fuel violence in most war and post-war environments , from afghanistan to sudan to timor-leste , and in the rare cases where there have been comprehensive , bottom-up peacebuilding initiatives , these attempts have been successful at making peace sustainable .
well , the reason why militias had attacked isabelle &apos;s village was because they wanted to take the land that the villagers needed to cultivate food and to survive .
well , first thing we do , we get showers working .
and these are the results we can get with our 7,500 dollars .

hello , come in , earth .
déclassé consumption is the whole idea that spending money frivolously makes you look a little bit anti-fashion .
and then they did a recent report i thought was fascinating .

let me just say that every unsecured transaction is a good example of a prisoner &apos;s dilemma .
it &apos;s like 96 percent .

we want male leaders to become role models and change agents within their own institutions .
we were hungry .
now sand is not only on earth , but sand is ubiquitous throughout the universe . in fact , outer space is filled with sand , and that sand comes together to make our planets and the moon .
an amazing array of incredible things exist in sand .

why don &apos;t we know these stories ?
but saying her name is not enough .
it &apos;s not just going to disappear .
this is the hang seng index for hong kong .
and naturally , i encounter a lot of resistance , because it &apos;s considered to be anti-intellectual and counter to serious learning .
because doodling is so universally accessible and it is not intimidating as an art form , it can be leveraged as a portal through which we move people into higher levels of visual literacy .
how many people are trying to learn english worldwide ?
okay , religious mania : there &apos;s rapture , there &apos;s weeping , there &apos;s visions .
and the most important thing you can do , i think , is to use your personal power and your rolodex to lead your business , your institution , in going green .
and we &apos;re encouraging others to do it as well .
this has crucial implications for what the universe is going to do in the future .
a low entropy configuration is one in which there &apos;s only a few arrangements that look that way .
real nobel laureates hand you the prize .
in the u.s. alone , a billion birds die in collision with glass buildings .
ed boyden : that &apos;s right .
now over the last couple of years , we &apos;ve gone back to the tree of life because we wanted to find ways to turn circuits in the brain off .
and you find this whether it &apos;s world history , or mathematics , or science , or whatever it is .
it &apos;s , you know , sailing upon some land , and thinking , &quot; i think i &apos;ll draw that bit of land , &quot; and then wondering , &quot; &quot; maybe there &apos;s some more land to draw . &quot; &quot; and that &apos;s when learning really began for me .
aydah al jahnani also took risks and put herself out , to compete in the poet of the millions competition .
this has opened up the door , particularly for women .
dr. v : supposing i &apos;m able to produce eye care , techniques , methods , all in the same way , and make it available in every corner of the world .
now , each year we perform about 300,000 surgeries .
more than three and a half thousand photos go up onto facebook .
and 60 seconds is the amount of time it took for it to travel 250 kilometers to managua .
now , that early universe was incredibly dense , like a metal , way denser , and if you hit it , it would ring , but the thing ringing would be the structure of space-time itself , and the hammer would be quantum mechanics .
but it &apos;s not exactly 2.7 degrees .
so they &apos;re skin cells that can be tricked , kind of like cellular amnesia , into an embryonic state .
did i mention they &apos;re gorgeous ?
but that &apos;s not just with autistic people , either .
you don &apos;t have the urge to do that .

( applause ) thank you .
and he called this part of the course the x factor , the potential of the human will .
see , all you really need is one person to show you the epiphany of your own power , and you &apos;re off .
but you get the sense of the hall in section .
p for palladio .
so it comes from the southwest . it &apos;s a southwest monsoon .
now , what i said was , you get the southwest monsoon going one way , and then it changes and you get the northeast monsoon going the other way .
her first marriage did not survive , nor did her second marriage .
so if these young girls know that there are laws that protect them , they will be able to stand up and defend themselves because they will know that there is a law that protects them .
fn : thank you ted . and thank you chris , for having us .
it &apos;s twice the range of any electric motorcycle .

and the children , we teach during six months how to separate their garbage .
in the mornings it is terrible , and the afternoon is worst .
and i know you feel it .
why does the universe exist ?
let &apos;s find out .
so do babies care whether the tiny bit of evidence they see is plausibly representative of a larger population ?
so if we take a long-term perspective , we explore .
i think it &apos;s difficult because there are so many traps that keep us where we are .
then , we tried our combination superweapon .
second , this layer contains molecules which bind specifically to our tumor cell .
we need variety . we need surprise .

it has 10 variations . ( typing noise ) ( typing noise ) there &apos;s a shift .
they started saying , &quot; &quot; this is interesting .
you may also know that actually a line of therapy has been coming along based on that fact .
there are lots of people shaping decisions and so if we want to predict correctly we have to pay attention to everybody who is trying to shape the outcome , not just the people at the pinnacle of the decision-making pyramid .
he is on the way down .
every week , the man would bring bread with raisins , with all sorts of good things , put it into the ark .
and the poor man said , &quot; &quot; and you mean god didn &apos;t answer my pleas ? &quot; &quot; and the rabbi said , &quot; &quot; you &apos;ve misunderstood me .
if i turn this wheel , you can see that number over there going minus and positive .
but we couldn &apos;t create 1,000 new teachers this summer to save our life .
it &apos;s a great honor today to share with you the digital universe , which was created for humanity to really see where we are in the universe .
and to be able to see our context in this larger sense at all scales helps us all , i think , in understanding where we are and who we are in the universe .
the soviet union collapsed , iraq was defeated , and a new environment was created in the region in which both of them felt more secure , but they were also now left unchecked .
the iranians built a special tarmac at the airport in tehran , far away from the central terminal , so that no one would notice the large number of israeli planes shuttling between tel aviv and tehran .

and as was typical with the norden bombsight , the bomb actually missed its target by 800 ft .
and he &apos;s a swiss engineer , carl .
mars is incredibly cold because it has a very thin atmosphere .
ask any 10-year-old girl if she wants to go to mars .

so basically , no one would accept family planning if their children didn &apos;t survive .
history always does it .
and guess what ?
the one thing about this is it gives us extraordinary leverage .
and that &apos;s one of the fundamental reasons that this problem is so hard to talk about , and , in general , i think it &apos;s the underlying reason that it &apos;s been politically unacceptable to talk about this .

there &apos;s a flip side as well .
it means that the police are going to have a tougher time catching bad guys .
whatsapp , which is now owned by facebook and used by hundreds of millions of people around the world , also has built strong encryption technology into its product , which means that people in the global south can easily communicate without their governments , often authoritarian , wiretapping their text messages .
it was the liberalization of international financial markets .
there has , however , been no concomitant increase in the resources available to police forces .
one of these mechanisms is transparency , telling people what you are going to do with their data .
to test that , we did an experiment on carnegie mellon university campus .
it evolves .
so we &apos;ve seen that this can happen in animals .
imagine you get to 123 meters .
i get something of a shock at the very moment when i decide to go up .
it &apos;s my first year as a new high school science teacher , and i &apos;m so eager .
here , this cloaked , secret agent virus is slipping his dna into the bacterial cell , but here &apos;s the kicker : it doesn &apos;t do anything harmful — not at first .

the gap between shanghai and the united kingdom and the united states is as big as the gap between the u.k. and the u.s.
some designers don &apos;t design objects , products , things that we &apos;re going to actually use , but rather , they design scenarios that are object-based .
because it &apos;s not anymore mom , dad , the flowers and the bees , and then there &apos;s the baby . no , it can be two moms , three dads , in-vitro — there &apos;s the whole idea of how babies can be made today that has changed .
harry cliff : i was very lucky that i joined the experiment i work on at the lhc in 2008 , just as we were switching on , and there are people in my research group who have been working on it for three decades , their entire careers on one machine .
i was wondering how you and your colleagues welcome the news .
and she said , &quot; &quot; why wouldn &apos;t i thank it , even though they &apos;re supposed to do it ? &quot; &quot; so , the question is , why was i blocking it ?
i know a woman who &apos;s good at this .
you know , this way you could go to the container store and buy one of those metal sheets that they hang on the back of your door , in your closet , and you could literally stick your shoes up instead of using a shelf .
again , it &apos;s perfectly safe for people . it puts out the fires , doesn &apos;t hurt anything .
they wear nice dresses , high-heeled shoes .
i wanted to become a teacher .
we see projects which are much beyond any single research team can do , and this is really new for the humanities , which very often take the habit of working in small groups or only with a couple of researchers .
in my lab , we develop tools to travel not only in space but also through time .
superfluids are one of the most fragile things we &apos;ve ever discovered .
i remember thinking , my friend could have explained that entire experiment with a dance .
we called the project face 2 face .
&quot; oh , you know , we &apos;re just doing art . &quot; &quot; art ? &quot;
we want to get out of this thing where the young people have all the ideas , and the old people have all the power and decide what science gets done .
in the 20th century , we saw the independent development of two big themes in science .
they often lead to the acceleration of much-needed reforms .
and he ended his life selling companies to venture capitalists .
so rio , like so many cities across the global south , is a place where you can go from northern europe to sub-saharan africa in the space of 30 minutes .
obrigado . thank you .
this isn &apos;t about the biology of people ; this is now about the brains , the psychology of people , and innovation needs to continue all the way through the last mile .
i want you to do it fast , and say it out loud with me , and do it quickly . i &apos;ll make the first one easy for you .
anyone who thought that misinterprets the purpose of the interface .
now , this is a bit surprising , because to the extent that we think about vision at all , we think of it as like a camera .
another reason jane is not so happy is because she &apos;s worried .
she doesn &apos;t look the happiest .
it &apos;s about as mysterious as the liquidity of water .
well , think about the distinction between feeling a pain and engaging in pain behavior .
5.5 — almost twice as much .
to a psychologist .
with this , i was faced with a dilemma : do i tell the dying that they are about to face death , or do i lie to them to comfort them ?
the dying need to know that their life had meaning .
so why might we want to do this ?
the implication is that microbes can affect mammalian behavior .
they engage in many practices thought to confer good health and survival to an advanced age .
and there are increasing signs that he is about to depart on his own journey for puya .
we said , so we &apos;ll put in a stent , but we &apos;re not going to put in a stent that we &apos;d put in people .
and computers don &apos;t go to sleep .
( laughter ) it can also learn from you about the quality of its jokes and cater things , sort of like netflix-style , over longer-term to different communities or audiences , children versus adults , different cultures .
thank you .
but in a world of conservation reliance , those stories have very real consequences , because now , how we feel about an animal affects its survival more than anything that you read about in ecology textbooks .
he says , &quot; &quot; i feel bad about the polar bears .
( applause )
it was significant for another reason . this is an international mission , and this event was celebrated in europe , in germany , and the celebratory presentations were given in english accents , and american accents , and german accents , and french and italian and dutch accents .
384,000 women , american women , last year went in for elective breast augmentation surgery .
and the reason that i do this , it &apos;s because i have this fear that we aren &apos;t feeling enough as a culture right now .
this is the nest of the mature colony , and there &apos;s the nest entrance .
in the beginning you see the ants just kind of engaging with the fiber optics microscope .
now , society hasn &apos;t advanced all that much .
but then supermarkets started selling smaller , 11-centimeter pies , and suddenly , apple fell to fourth or fifth place .
so , this was told to me in a setup of elders .
all of a sudden i passed the national examination , found myself in a very beautiful high school in kenya .
by applying a strict process , we give them less control , less choice , but we enable more and richer social interactions .
companies can give people more control , but they can also give them less control .
and here is our first footage of these biofluorescent swellsharks .
sharks .
and you &apos;ll see , just now , a nurse coming back to the tray , which is their sort of modular station , and dropping the syringe she &apos;s just used back in the tray for it to be picked up and used again .
and that job is that they go around and pick up syringes from the back of hospitals , wash them , and in the course of this , obviously picking them up they injure themselves .
it &apos;s just like our english and dutch example .
languages contain patterns .
you &apos;ve got to go in there and hang out at the barbershop , you &apos;ve got to attend that black church , and you &apos;ve got to view those folks that have the power to engage and just take notes on what they do .
now , how do you teach it ? you teach it by allowing people
i teach chemistry .
( applause )
first of all , as i explained , to ask a computer &quot; &quot; is that number prime ? &quot; &quot; to type it in its abbreviated form , and then only about six lines of code is the test for primacy , is a remarkably simple question to ask .
now a few things you might like to know about prime numbers .
maharaja : nothing to worry about , not a thing .
now movies proved to be the ultimate medium for magic .
he could tell a story about an event , and so you felt you were absolutely there at the moment .
and to think that in 30 , 40 years they could become extinct .
mahalakshmi is chasing me , i am keeping in the back pocket .
i don &apos;t even use that cloth to clean my two-wheeler .
the industry average is about 65 percent .
and with centralized manufacturing , you can control the quality control , and you can hit that $ 80 price point with profit margins built in .
thank you .
it was grey and black , and he thought it looked cheap .
but does it just happen over there ?
our first campaign was investigating the role of illegal logging in funding the war in cambodia .
( laughter ) ( applause ) and as it turns out , lots and lots of men wanted to date me .
and as it turns out , content matters a lot .
when i say that country x is the goodest country on earth , and i mean goodest , i don &apos;t mean best .
but actually , aren &apos;t most of us not really so very good at empathy ?
the central commercial district of kabul , afghanistan at the end of the civil war , shortly before the city fell to the taliban .
in 1981 , i went to northern ireland .
( applause )
this is a real thing .
and there &apos;s not just one of these , there &apos;s many of them .
it could do the &quot; &quot; if then &quot; &quot; for basic programmers , and that fundamentally made it into a computer .
do not do that .
it &apos;s what i now have the privilege of saying to twentysomethings like emma every single day : thirty is not the new 20 , so claim your adulthood , get some identity capital , use your weak ties , pick your family .
for example , you could plot the flow of carbon through corporate supply chains in a corporate ecosystem , or the interconnections of habitat patches for endangered species in yosemite national park .
i &apos;m an ecologist , and i study complexity . i love complexity .
i was confused .
how could they do this to me ?
again , like i said , my life has been about being fascinated by objects and the stories that they tell , and also making them for myself , obtaining them , appreciating them and diving into them .
and again , i kept on going , looking for more reference , every bit of reference i could find — drawings , beautiful photos .
it &apos;s easy to say what we don &apos;t want .
it &apos;s also interesting to think about what other things are — so if these all enabled great values , why should we think that evolution has happened to provide us with all the modalities we would need to engage with other values that there might be ?
imagine if your life depended on this package , somewhere in africa or in new york city , after sandy .
many of those nations have excellent telecommunications today without ever putting copper lines in the ground .
you &apos;re a brilliant young neuroscientist .
rs : i hope they do . and i think they probably won &apos;t .
and it &apos;s not just a lot of people , it &apos;s a really diverse group , people from a wide range of ages , from 18 to late 80s , a wide range of incomes , education levels , people who are married , divorced , widowed , etc .
and yet it &apos;s not clear what the relationship is between our use of this ability and our happiness .
they have been watching us for much longer than we have been watching them .
why is it that killer whales have returned to researchers lost in thick fog and led them miles until the fog parted and the researchers &apos; home was right there on the shoreline ?
so this is true .
but how does it work ?
her family has eight generations in a town called whitesville , west virginia .
and i think because early on , frankly , my programs were just a little bit ahead of their time .
i couldn &apos;t use my locker for weeks because the bolt on the lock reminded me of the one i had put on my lips when the homeless man on the corner looked at me with eyes up merely searching for an affirmation that he was worth seeing .
it is feeling your flaws gut-wrench guillotine your tongue .
and the other one has arthritis of the shoulder joint , you know , it &apos;s not working very well , so it &apos;s walking like this , and we can move the arm , you know , that way .
these are the rovers up here that you have on mars now .
i started building this project when i was about 12 or 13 years old .
for hundreds of dollars , i &apos;ve developed a system that exceeds the sensitivity of detectors that are hundreds of thousands of dollars .
but i hope that you are at least partly convinced that it is not impossible to build a brain .
the reason why the moon is huge on the horizon is simply because our perceptual bubble does not stretch out 380,000 kilometers .
this will find its own place .
so i said , i &apos;m going to do something else .
thank you .
&quot; why do you say such things , aboody ? &quot;
now while those in power , old and new , continue to cling to business as usual , millions are still pushing back , and pushing forward to what they hope will be a better life .
but sex , everybody is doing it , but nobody wants to talk about it . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) ( music ) ( in arabic ) sef : i want to give you a piece of advice , which if you follow it , will make you happy in life .
her name is yahli .
we have no chance of competing against machines on frequent , high-volume tasks .
it &apos;s going to get into your drinking water , into your food , into your immediate surroundings .
and if you &apos;re living in fecal material and it &apos;s surrounding you , you &apos;re going to get sick .
that means that those of us in this room who are less than 50 or 60 years old will see how these paradoxes are resolved , and those of us who are over the age of 60 may not see the resolution , but our children and grandchildren certainly will .
going through the same checklist : human environmental impacts ?
now the impulse to notate , or , more exactly i should say , encode music has been with us for a very long time .
turns out it was capable of expressing emotions beyond the ability of words .
he would , i imagine , first of all express very strongly his sorrow for the misfortune of that unhappy people .
on the contrary , it produces pleasure .
it &apos;s the females , i think , that lay the eggs , and then the males fertilize them .
would that ever happen ? &quot; &quot; and i said , &quot; &quot; oh , no , no .
it &apos;s population-based .
you can go to orcatech.org — it has nothing to do with whales , it &apos;s the oregon center for aging and technology — to see more about that .
i &apos;m going to take on the naysayers , because they &apos;ll make my argument better and stronger .
she remembered , for example , when her mother had broken a leg and went into the hospital , and she had a lot of x-rays , and two of them were leg x-rays , which made sense , but six of them were chest x-rays , which didn &apos;t .
and she had to go along just to be with her sister for company , and in that process , she made a number of decisions .
and we had a conversation , and then i asked her this unthinkable question .
and right off the garage he has his own trophy room where he can sort of bask in his accomplishments , which is another sort of important part about a manspace .
it had everything i needed . it was quiet .
( applause )
so these images are the work of my friend and colleague , mark boyer , who is here in the audience today .
now when i got out , i was diagnosed and i was given medications by a psychiatrist .
&quot; &quot; okay , josh , why don &apos;t we give you some — why don &apos;t we give you some zyprexa .
so as part of the demonstration , what i have is a pair of gloves , and we &apos;ve coated one of the gloves with the nanotechnology coating , and let &apos;s see if you can tell which one , and i &apos;ll give you a hint .
and it has billions of interstitial spaces , and those spaces , along with the nanoparticles , reach up and grab the air molecules , and cover the surface with air .
we launched school education and workplace interventions .
it was true of aids .
and this is why i have been looking into solar cells and solar panels .
a solar cell absorbs light and converts it into electrical energy .
some recent stories : nanobees zap tumors with real bee venom ; they &apos;re sending genes into the brain ; a robot they built that can crawl through the human body .
it &apos;s a project by the long now foundation , which was founded by tedsters including kevin kelly and stewart brand .
we were like , &quot; &quot; we &apos;re home , we &apos;re here . &quot; &quot; then somebody took us to rundle mall .
i went home and said to my mom , &quot; you did something . &quot;
and i &apos;m not here to be the poster girl for the homeless .
i hadn &apos;t changed . my i.q. hadn &apos;t dropped .
that &apos;s an american c-17 cargo plane that flew us from new zealand to mcmurdo in antarctica .
and just to give you an idea , they have spent 20 million over 20 years .
and there it entered into the alchemy community as geomancy : divination through the earth .
in some cases , there would actually be algorithms , and very sophisticated algorithms .
what emerged was a beautiful and complicated portrait of america .
i &apos;m a blogger , a filmmaker and a butcher , and i &apos;ll explain how these identities come together .
i didn &apos;t know that the first stage in any domestic violence relationship is to seduce and charm the victim .
conor first physically attacked me five days before our wedding .
but if you become the president of zimbabwe , and you say , &quot; &quot; you know , i really like this job .
i experienced my first coup d &apos;état at the age of four .
so what is the next revolution likely to be ?
so what is the next window into our universe ?
thank you very much .
then pollution takes its toll , mainly due to untreated sewage and chemical dumping from crafts such as tanning .
when was the last time your physician asked you where you &apos;ve lived ?
now how about controlling other elements ?
we deal in milliseconds .
now fast forward to just three years ago .
as these caves form and melt their way up into the ice , they make these artifacts rain down from the ceiling and fall onto the cave floor , where we end up finding them .
around this half of the country , most of your caves are made of limestone .
so the music had been my therapy for me .
first time i &apos;m feeling like a human being .
it &apos;s ok . you start to be in the territory of intelligence , we can say .
and if we don &apos;t deeply understand , if we don &apos;t integrate that we are mutants , we completely miss the story .
there is no other reason to have a brain .
so the old days before digital radio when you were tuning in your radio and you heard &quot; &quot; crrcckkk &quot; &quot; on the station you wanted to hear , that was the noise .
but for ratings , a crucial element of our economy , we really do not know what all the different ingredients are .
but we also have to ask the question , who is cultivating the economic soil of a country , right ?
it &apos;s one of those ideas that &apos;s so simple , yet brilliant , you wonder why it &apos;s never been done before .
these three systems are coming together , allowing people to share resources without sacrificing their lifestyles , or their cherished personal freedoms .
now , one of the ways you can make them not fly is with ddt .
so , that &apos;s what i have . thanks very much .
let me just try to draw some conclusions from what has happened .
in germany , we have a system where you are not allowed to bribe a civil servant , but you are allowed to bribe a deputy .
but i believe now that we &apos;re moving into a new age , and that age the new york times dubbed recently as &quot; &quot; the age of behavior . &quot; &quot; how i define the age of behavior is a period of transnational allegiances , where identity is defined more so by ideas and narratives .
an identity was defined primarily by religion .
take the emotion of fear , for instance . it keeps us away from doing things that are really , really risky .
but one thing that i am fairly certain about is , at the very least , what we can do with this research is point to what questions we ought to ask in the first place .
they died of massive infection .
it has to be able to come off of the centerline and then be able to work back toward that centerline .
so i went to sleep , and that was it for me .
because you &apos;re not in the middle east .
lightly pigmented skin evolved not just once , not just twice , but probably three times .
well he didn &apos;t write anything about it in the origin of species .
and the bacteria synchronize quite well at this scale , but because the molecule that synchronizes them together can only travel so fast , in larger colonies of bacteria , this results in traveling waves between bacteria that are far away from each other , and you can see these waves going from right to left across the screen .
we started using probiotic bacteria which are safe bacteria that have a health benefit , and found that when orally delivered to mice , these probiotics would selectively grow inside of liver tumors .
we steamed up the windows permanently , and every hour we had a different designer come in and write these things that they &apos;ve learned into the steam in the window .
this is a projection that can see the viewer as the viewer walks by .
so , given that kind of video input , with just about six or seven minutes worth of video , dylan can begin to extract patterns that include faces .
this simple idea has far reaching implications .
here is the video .
you know , these days , you always get images during the winter , when they take the roof down , of people who have been there and said , &quot; &quot; they demolished the building . &quot; &quot; no , they didn &apos;t demolish it , just when it goes down , the architecture almost disappears .
i &apos;m not saying instead of , i &apos;m saying as well as , aids , tb , malaria , typhoid — the list goes on .
decide which instruments , stock it up with consumables .
we &apos;re in this together . &quot; &quot; may nguyen , a family physician in houston : &quot; &quot; my colleagues are astounded by what i &apos;m doing .
just one generation ago , this was the norm in the u.s. as well .
it is down-cycled and turned into lesser things , while a glass bottle can be a glass bottle again or can be used again — a plastic bottle can never be a plastic bottle again .
i guess what i want to say to everybody here — and i know that you guys know a lot about this issue — is that this is a huge problem in the oceans , but this is a problem that we &apos;ve created as consumers and we can solve .
being run over is never easy .
that &apos;s one of the most dangerous horse stunts , certainly .
and the world &apos;s population expected to top out at something hopefully a bit less than 10 billion , late this century .
but a declining population is going to have at least two very beneficial economic effects .
and if you plot them , you must choose some system .
the eiffel tower has a fractal aspect .
( laughing ) so the tedtalk laid out in very simple terms , a charter city is a place where you start with uninhabited land , a charter that specifies the rules that will apply there and then a chance for people to opt in , to go live under those rules or not .
imagine half the people who wanted to be in apartments already had them ; the other half aren &apos;t there yet .
so , if you are a fan of the game of thrones , you definitely know how important a big wall is for an old kingdom .
but on the other hand , they want to keep the server in beijing so they can access the data any time they want .
if you do the calculations on the ballistics , on the stopping power of the rock fired from david &apos;s sling , it &apos;s roughly equal to the stopping power of a &#91; .45 caliber &#93; handgun .
when david lines up — and he &apos;s not 200 yards away from goliath , he &apos;s quite close to goliath — when he lines up and fires that thing at goliath , he has every intention and every expectation of being able to hit goliath at his most vulnerable spot between his eyes .
kinsey thought it was bunk , so he got to work .
alright .
how can we do that ?
what was once a burundian problem becomes an african problem .
raise your hand , and we &apos;ll try to get you a microphone .
we &apos;ll all be better off if good music is played rather than terrible music .
they &apos;re experiencing that rawness there .
if i just simply let go and allow my hand , my arm , to be more of a support system , suddenly i have more dynamic with less effort . much more .
our forest in brazil , that antique forest that was the size of california , is destroyed today 93 percent .
brazil was starting to urbanize , industrialize , and i knew the politics . i became a little bit radical , i was a member of leftist parties , and i became an activist .
i was more interested in the things in between , you know , because you can leave an enormous range for ambiguity there .
but once they &apos;re applied to numeric structure , then you can feel more comfortable .
ca : there isn &apos;t . i &apos;ll tell you what .
and he &apos;s a wonderful musician , so it &apos;s cool .
( applause )
why haven &apos;t we done that ? why is that hard ?
but we wanted to make the economic case , because if we could make the economic case , then the value of doing this would be completely compelling .
and this creates a structure through which they can combine .
and eventually , over time , i didn &apos;t have to play the stage fright song at all .
but i took a deep breath , and i signed up to play , and i felt pretty good .
don &apos;t be fooled . there &apos;s nothing new about id .
why does this far more substantial minority not make a move to exercise its political muscle ?
but it &apos;s now your turn .
i not only play at the prestigious classical concert halls like carnegie hall and kennedy center , but also hospitals , churches , prisons , and restricted facilities for leprosy patients , just to mention a few .
and all of the colors come out one central port at the bottom .
is that relevant to your work ?
i also tell it because it tells a larger contextual story of what aid is and can be .
and i &apos;m thinking , no , this is not possible .
( singing ) yesterday , mallika sarabhai showed us that music can create a world more accepting of difference than the one we have been given .
then things get tense .
the fact that they have stuck here with this kind of performance has been , well , you know , you win the war in 12 minutes ; why do you need something better ?
the first industry will be a high volume , a lot of players .
and the coal industries and the oil industries spent a quarter of a billion dollars in the last calendar year promoting clean coal , which is an oxymoron .
video : ♪ ♫ frosty the coal man is a jolly , happy soul .
it &apos;s worked for diseases like leukemia .
we &apos;ve thought about personalization of medicine very much in terms of genomics .
this is deeply democratizing .
but this is being announced today .
beauty can be found anywhere .
which is to say , of course , it was badly designed .
i had christian bibles .
how should we view the bible ?
so instead of being grand opera , this opera will turn into what we &apos;re thinking of as personal opera .
and we started by making instruments for some of the world &apos;s greatest performers — we call these hyperinstruments — for yo-yo ma , peter gabriel , prince , orchestras , rock bands . instruments where they &apos;re all kinds of sensors built right into the instrument , so the instrument knows how it &apos;s being played .
and the most studied silk line of them all : major ampullate silk .
this is a rugged and barren landscape , yet there are quite a few spiders here .
armani — who said armani ? you ?
( applause ) but also the other hand is good , if all the other guys have good hands too .
you needed to know that .
but it &apos;s not a cri de coeur about man &apos;s hubris in the face of the elements .
as recently at last decade , most of the media that was available for public consumption was produced by professionals .
the 10th one was kittens on a treadmill , but that &apos;s the internet for you .
you should have seen the looks .
silly at a level that i hadn &apos;t yet understood silliness to be .
at the eighth stop , a girl came in with a giant duffel bag and announced she had pants for sale for a dollar — like you might sell batteries or candy on the train .
a lot of them made jokes about trying to get us to go to the back to get heavy television sets for customers .
grandma ruby &apos;s stepfather gramps was one of few black men to retire from carnegie &apos;s mill with his pension .
an industrial suburb , braddock is home to andrew carnegie &apos;s first steel mill , the edgar thomson works .
i could see what you &apos;re applying for .
it was autumn . it was cool . it was damp . it was getting dark .
and our organization helps women across that bridge .
the care doesn &apos;t stop when the baby &apos;s born — we deal with the ongoing health of the mother and baby , ensuring that they live healthy , successful lives .
so in a way , i &apos;ve created sort of a genetic network , a genetic social network , really .
( applause )
and they all seemed to be ok .
( laughter ) and we had to take action . now our kids found out about it .
thank you .
and even at this point , i started to move away from the need to replicate human-ness as the only aesthetic ideal .
so you ’ ve got that covered .
you should also keep your blood pressure down , because chronic high blood pressure is the biggest single risk factor for alzheimer ’ s disease .
it &apos;s self-assembling .
and like , knock like a woodpecker on my door until i opened it up .
so i would drag myself into my dance studio — body , mind and spirit — every day into my dance studio , and learn everything i learned when i was four , all over again , reworked , relearned , regrouped .
she was also called simhanandini , the one who rode the lion .
and i &apos;ll just hook up the forward arrow .
so i started right away . i was at mit media lab , and i was studying the maker movement and makers and creativity .
and for 18 years , those 57 meters of concrete stayed grey .
and when he saw i was painting in arabic , he got so mad — actually , hysterical — and he asked for the wall to be erased .
reporter : israeli border police were sent to disperse the crowd .
so they kept on going .
first thing to notice is , half of them do not even have access to a 401 ( k ) plan .
twelve percent do .
so we decided to change our fighting-bigortry- with-delightful-posters campaign and turn it into the fighting-bigotry- with-a-delightful-lawsuit campaign .
i &apos;m an iranian-american muslim female , like all of you .
there was cell phone service way out in the middle of nowhere .
for them , it was such a surprise — they had never , ever been interrupted before — that it was such an impressive event for them , that we &apos;ve heard from our partners they have not been back since .
why not buy his book ? tweet it . share it .
we can choose to take time back .
( laughter ) okay , we &apos;re going to start that verse again .
i became very curious about the poets after spending six years with them , and started to research their lives , and then decided to write a book about it .
and now take a look at the death rates from lung cancer in women over time .
today , we know that women are 70 percent more likely to experience depression over their lifetimes compared with men .
it is a one-button operation that you can do for free .
the classic answer is to form an institution , right ?
this is the most devastating epidemic of our time .
but there is a fundamental problem that is killing the efforts in fighting this disease , because if you keep throwing drugs out at people who don &apos;t have diagnostic services , you end up creating a problem of drug resistance .
so you have men and women flexing and posing in this extraordinary spotlight .
the human drama in which each one of us plays a part is a great story , a story that encompasses the whole world and that came to unfold in the three stages of the painting in the sistine chapel .
and this is what the young generation says .
this message is given as a public service .
they &apos;re going to make all that stuff go away .
what are the exact instructions that are making it do that ?
( applause ) i am wearing the al gore in-ear monitors he wore on the larry king show and i &apos;m hearing that transmission and not mine .
it &apos;s completely fucked up and can only be explained in song .
( laughter ) these are expressions of truth as awe-full things , by meaning they are things you can worship .
and think about some of the things that we &apos;re learning about cellular mechanics .
we &apos;re beginning to explore what it means to communicate with something that isn &apos;t just another person .
sue savage-rumbaugh : can you play a grooming song ?
stepping onto the sidewalk , i then heard the sound of a steel chair slide across the concrete sidewalk in front of me .
the space between buildings will be well-balanced between people and cars .
more than cars or the internet or even that little mobile device we keep talking about , the technology you &apos;re using the most almost every day is this , your tush .
( applause )

and that showed me such a fundamental truth , that music making and other forms of creativity can so often go to places where mere words cannot .
i know you &apos;re going to say to me , &quot; &quot; t doesn &apos;t exist in music . &quot; &quot; well ladies and gentlemen , there &apos;s a time-honored system , which composers have been using for hundreds of years , which proves actually that it does .
these are unrelated machines , right ?
here , we have a whole bunch of disparate images .

it only got a 500 , it could have gotten as high up as a 1,000 . &quot; &quot; and this seatbelt would have passed with flying colors into being approved as a car seat .
and then here &apos;s the six-year-old in the seatbelt , and in fact , they get exactly within , you know , within one or two points of the same . so really , for the six-year-old , the car seat did absolutely nothing whatsoever .
( laughter ) but we &apos;d be rich ! ( laughter )
this was 50,000 years ago , so it may have wiped out a few buffalo or antelope , or something like that out in the desert , but it probably would not have caused global devastation .
so in the search box i typed in &quot; mother &apos;s day , &quot; and i was surprised and delighted to see a list of dozens and dozens of mother &apos;s day cards that showed up on the scratch website , many of them just in the past 24 hours by procrastinators just like myself .

now the idea of having new perspectives of our planet and actually being able to get that message out gets me out of bed every day with a spring in my step .
what i mean by that , and let me use this example , the country of south africa , because i was just there , therefore i &apos;m a little bit familiar with some of the challenges they have .
because it was felt that a school day would last at least eight hours , and you wanted the child to have the ability to use the laptop for at least one full day without having to recharge it .

all of my relationships have failed .
i don &apos;t think that we can not anthropomorphize .
she would hide in the closet .

he developed an interesting outsourcing model for sexual services , ( laughter ) no longer tied to a single monopoly provider , in many cases , sourcing things locally , and of course , the ability to have between one and three girls delivered at any time led for better load-balancing .

this sort of ability to do everything in new ways unleashes potential , not least in the area of medicine .
now , the gift is very nutritious , and the female eats it during and after mating .
the allure of another world is something that people say is part of why they want to dabble in the paranormal .

and the spider &apos;s web is for the reins on the horse .
and finally a girl explaining in marathi what it is , and said , &quot; &quot; there &apos;s a processor inside . &quot; &quot; so i started publishing .
there &apos;s only one granny who manages health and safety .
and as soon as i found that word , i realized that i wanted to devote much of the rest of my life to it .
the rivers changed in response to the wolves , and the reason was that the regenerating forests stabilized the banks so that they collapsed less often , so that the rivers became more fixed in their course .

millions have lived , and global health has been transformed .
it changes the life of the person who receives it , and it changes the life of the person who expresses it .
what they all do is important .
most days looked like this .
some of them were pitchpole capsizes , flipping her end over end , and rowing became impossible .
but you also have to provide usable evidence that you are trustworthy .
the aim is to have more trust .
and what it basically implies is that , in houses now , we don &apos;t need drapes or shutters or blinds anymore because we can sheath the building with these things , as well as control the amount of air conditioning you need inside that building .
great , right ? well , we have similar problems in buildings .
after all , online course content has been available for a while .

i think none of these is the problem .
we need gandhis .

this is a mapnificent map that shows me , in this case , how far i can get from my home in 30 minutes using public transportation .

designing .
so before i talk about what is , i think , the critical difference between lolcats and ushahidi , i want to talk about their shared source .
and if you spend a lot of time in hospital , you &apos;ll see a lot of types of irrationalities .
no bill ever disappeared .
meet wael .
first , financial .
ca : gary , i think you &apos;ve done a spectacular job of bringing this to the world &apos;s attention in your book and right here today .

as gamers we are now living by the same laws of physics in the same cities and doing many of the same things we once did in real life , only virtually .
well , no , actually it &apos;s 30 years old .
it &apos;s only four by four by seven millimeters in size .

so i went to colombia . and i reproduced the experiment .

the mashup is owned by lucas .
letter after letter attacking youtube &apos;s refusal to be more respectful of fair use with their extraordinary notice and take down system , that led his campaign so many times to be thrown off the internet .
so if you look , you can see a lot of different machines come out of this . they all move around .
( applause ) so , we &apos;ll move forward to a different idea .
have you guys seen those ?
now , at some point i was in hawaii — i like to hike and surf and do all that weird stuff , and i was making a collage for my ma .
probably the biggest change was understanding that the generational difference , the ages , had changed so much .
and then when it &apos;s time to go , a green light goes and the jumpmaster goes , &quot; &quot; go . &quot; &quot; the first guy goes , and you &apos;re just in line , and you just kind of lumber to the door .
and also , they are in emerging countries where you can see the cities literally growing .
the second example is a master plan of 2,000 apartments and facilities in the city of tunis .
( applause ) tom rielly : so sangu , of course , this is strong rhetoric .
but why pan-african ?

we &apos;re not real people . we are there to inspire .
i want to live in a world where we value genuine achievement for disabled people , and i want to live in a world where a kid in year 11 in a melbourne high school is not one bit surprised that his new teacher is a wheelchair user .
( laughter ) and every year there &apos;s research done on self-reported shyness among college students .
jane mcgonigal told us last year that by the time a boy is 21 , he &apos;s played 10,000 hours of video games , most of that in isolation .
this is the carbon intensity of economic growth in the economy at the moment .
it looks harmless enough .
so , to make the point , these guys had actually built their boat out of plastic trash , 15,000 empty water bottles latched together into two pontoons .

dp : memory . ao : your memory is truly amazing , and every concert we do , we ask the audience to participate , of course , by suggesting a piece derek might like to play .
( piano notes ) etc .
and my score on the narcissism personality index , or the npi-16 , is a reassuring 0.31 .
the rest of it is the bedside console ; just for reference , this is a sleep tracking system from just a few years ago — i mean , really until now .
and i think the main thing that i &apos;m interested in is trying to find a way of making the computer into a personal mode of expression .
this will take about 30 seconds or so .
so this building actually celebrates the water as it comes out of the recycling plant and goes into the reed bed so that it can be filtered for the final time .
that really involves designing behaviors and personality into products .
so if you want recipes to work — for virtually anything — health , education , government politics and education — you have to go to these places .
here , there isn &apos;t really an option .
you &apos;re not going to defy gravity .
and then what ?
we might just say , well , what are the most popular talks out there ?
what &apos;s trending now ? what &apos;s the popular talk now ?
that problem started when the gaza tunnel was being built .
when it &apos;s cold , we make a fire on the front or on the roof of our homes .
in the winter of 2004 , it rained in death valley .
it &apos;s a human system .

the power and coherency that comes from one person hearing , perceiving and playing all the voices makes a very different experience .
today we know they &apos;re made from protein molecules .
everyone with a brain is at risk .
a lot of work from the ground up is needed .
we don &apos;t want cities that are built for cars .
and that doesn &apos;t just work for me in terms of abstract numbers — this overload of health information that we &apos;re inundated with .
god forbid we should use that same standard that we make cap &apos;n crunch live by and bring it to drug companies .
and i , of course , don &apos;t have time to go into all of them .
as i mentioned last year , i grew up with no religion at all .
about once a year , i get a ballot that asks me about whether new uses , new pronunciations , new meanings , are acceptable .
just think about the phrase &quot; look it up in the dictionary , &quot; which suggests that all dictionaries are exactly the same .
we feel much the same way about other conflicts around the world .
they do not need this kind of help .
they made sure that younger teachers get a chance to watch master teachers at work .
how would i know what i was doing differently ?
a person who is self-centered , secluded , excluded , someone who doesn &apos;t participate or even examine public affairs .
so how then do we reunite the two halves of the agora ?
it doesn &apos;t have a particular purpose , and that &apos;s what &apos;s great about play .
and our committee , which consisted of a lot of hard scientists , did feel at the end of that study that the absence of play and a progressive suppression of developmentally normal play led him to be more vulnerable to the tragedy that he perpetrated .
it sounds sort of like &quot; &quot; tweeeeeet . &quot; &quot; like that .
you sound very nearby .
i &apos;ve come to understand the sentiments of george burns , who was performing still in las vegas well into his 90s .
now i have to confess , when i was a college undergraduate , i thought , okay , sex / death , sex / death , death for sex — it seemed pretty reasonable at the time , but with each passing year , i &apos;ve come to have increasing doubts .
so i think that actually step two , that i called a step a moment ago , isn &apos;t a step at all .
but irrespective of that age , i &apos;m claiming that the first person to live to 1,000 — subject of course , to , you know , global catastrophes — is actually , probably , only about 10 years younger than the first 150-year-old .
what happens at ground level , far from the halls of power , happens to ordinary citizens one by one .
their images fuelled resistance to the war and to racism .
during 41 years of teaching biology at harvard , i watched sadly as bright students turned away from the possibility of a scientific career or even from taking non-required courses in science because they were afraid of failure .
when something new is discovered , it &apos;s logical then that one of the follow-up steps is to find the mathematical and statistical methods to move its analysis forward .
and it &apos;s also beautiful .
and when i look at this building and then think about hospitals today , what amazes me is this building &apos;s ambition .
sounds so simple .
understand it .
but , you know , if people saw the results of this smart aid , i mean , they &apos;d be going crazy for it .
but these conferences are going on , and i know people get skeptical and cynical about the big global summits and the promises and their never being kept , but actually , the bits that are , are making a difference , and what the politicians need is more permission from the public .
other boy bands , country singers , gospel music , funk and rap and stand-up comedy , and there &apos;s even a whole section around drugs and jokes .
it &apos;s an incredibly rich set of data that we have about cities now , maybe even richer than any data set that we &apos;ve ever had before .
so changing our workplaces and building infrastructures of care would make a big difference , but we &apos;re not going to get equally valued choices unless we change our culture , and the kind of cultural change required means re-socializing men .
his friends may praise his decision , but underneath , they &apos;re scratching their heads .
so , that &apos;s very intuitive , and that &apos;s what we want .
think of a hamster in the pocket .
now when you see these mountains , most people think of garbage .
and i hope that you stop looking at yourself as a consumer — that &apos;s a label i &apos;ve always hated my entire life — and think of yourself as just using resources in one form , until they can be transformed to another form for another use later in time .
and you may ask : can we use this also to reveal politicians &apos; emotions ?
and before we leave the room , we tell them not to peek at the cards .
now , what do we do when we find a match ?
it would be like 36,000 people staring at 36,000 monitors each and every day , without so much as a coffee break .
and this is because hackers are only one element in a cybercriminal enterprise .
and if they did , he then passed on the money to the vendor and the stolen credit card details to the purchaser .
so where are we headed from here ?
the government is not successful on these things .
i want to say a word for the soil and the bees and the plants and the animals , and tell you about a tool , a very simple tool that i have found .
we &apos;ve been evolving just as long , just along different paths .
tatooine from star wars .
here , this animation is zooming in onto our solar system .
how does it feel to be a person using a zipcar ?

we offer a two-year diploma to talented students who have successfully completed their high school education .
and i called it the zimbabwe institute of vigital arts .
you can show a slogan , or a symbol , or a sign that stands for democracy .
here &apos;s what i mean . politics and — let &apos;s focus on the political system in particular question here , which is the system of democracy .
it converted these emotions into physical symptoms .
this was not just lightning .
given the access to technology , even a school in a tiny rural hamlet could project a dvd onto a white board .
we are inveterate storytellers .
one reviewer called elliott &apos;s story &quot; &quot; twitter fiction done right , &quot; &quot; because she did .
think about episodes that happened live on radio .
( applause )
but still , will the society , would they accept such a radical idea ?
and one idea comes from lessons from chewing crabs .
now , how does this compare to a fly ?
we &apos;ve been at it for 15 years already , but it &apos;s not at all done .
cr : which is a second thing about corporations .
and they don &apos;t mean it takes lots of experience to learn how to mop floors and empty trash cans .
well , not always .
i didn &apos;t say goodbye to anybody , not my mother , my father , my sisters , my brothers , my aunts , my uncles , my cousins , my grandparents , nobody .
it was the primary purpose of the social worker , the aim , to get the woman at her most vulnerable time in her entire life , to sign the adoption papers .
behind the headlines that lay behind these buildings is the fate of the often-indentured construction worker .
let &apos;s not forget these men , who are truly dying to work .
what we &apos;ve done so far is we have a few surrogate talkers from around the u.s.
rp : so now , samantha can say this .
they are going to think about it as this glorious instant when we laid down the very foundations of their lives , of their society , of their future .
humanity is going to go down this path .
it means that no building is too small for innovation , like this little reindeer pavilion that &apos;s as muscly and sinewy as the animals it &apos;s designed to observe .
everything is different now .
ohhhh .
and of that , only a tiny percentage ever goes viral and gets tons of views and becomes a cultural moment .
instead , it &apos;s folks getting together to do something for fun , rather than because they were told to , or because they were expecting to make a mint off of it .
and it &apos;s no longer just a &quot; &quot; i don &apos;t know . i couldn &apos;t get there . i guess i &apos;ll move on , &quot; &quot; but suddenly a collective consciousness about what is blocked and censored where online .
and b , i hate them and i &apos;m terrified of the power they hold .
tr : thank you so much .
in ethiopia , 70 percent , that &apos;s 7-0 percent of the population , depends on rainfall for its livelihood .
and how will they cope in a foreign land ?
is all of our brain going to start to shrink and atrophy like that ?
on the one hand , we can choose between a new golden age where information is more universally available than it &apos;s ever been in human history , where we all have the answers to our questions at our fingertips .
that &apos;s all . zuzana wanted hers to look like that .
i would sometimes make , i don &apos;t know , three or four different versions of a difficult letter like a lowercase a , and then stand back to choose which was the best .
man : just arrest yourself , sergeant .
i &apos;m trying to protect my face too .
watch to the right as someone jumps out of this truck at us .
we tested it a lot , but it could still fail .
a group of artists decided to paint a life-size tank on a wall . it &apos;s one to one .
thank you . ( applause ) ( applause ) thank you . shukran . ( applause )
let &apos;s get back to that . and the idea , too , of jews , christians and muslims — these traditions now so often at loggerheads — working together to create a document which we hope will be signed by a thousand , at least , of major religious leaders from all the traditions of the world .
these doctrines seemed unproven , abstract .
roger 2.0 : oprah , i can &apos;t tell you how great it is to be back on your show .
( laughter ) google him and he will make you laugh .
( laughter ) just a thought .
and we still don &apos;t know why this is happening .
they barricaded the place , and the teenagers were evicted , and the teenagers decided to fight back , not with bank cards or slogans but with constructing a critical process .
with shovels in hand , they started to dig .
now , china dramatically demonstrates both the potential and the challenges of working with rules .
so we can change — we as humans can change the rules that we use to interact with each other , for better , or for worse .
so she belongs to our family tree , but within that , of course , you do detailed analysis , and we know now that she belongs to the lucy species , known as australopithecus afarensis .
but if this species , ancient species , would travel in time and see us today , they would very much be very proud of their legacy , because they became the ancestors of the most successful species in the universe .
so we had a dance , and girls and their fathers came in multitudes .
( laughter ) they acted silly .
so it &apos;s not that it &apos;s untrue completely .
there are some .
i went down there in the winter time .
this problem has continued to grow each year since i was there .
( laughter ) but i recited a cheer . i recited a cheer along with everybody else .
just like the rest of my family , my grandfather &apos;s favorite thing to do in the whole world was to read .
we &apos;ve got to start building cities and human environments where a 150-pound person can go a couple of miles in a dense , rich , green-space environment , without being in a 4,000-pound machine to do it .
because technically i &apos;ve got motors ; i &apos;ve got wheels — i &apos;m a motor vehicle .
and on a macro level — some of the speakers have inferred that even health should be privatized .
but as human beings , we also want to see each other , and we want to be heard by each other , and we should never forget that .
( murmuring ) pardon ?
at the age of 70 , he is linking up something very creative .
you &apos;ve heard this too , i can tell .
and what &apos;s amazing is , even though we flew very high above this forest , later on in analysis , we can go in and actually experience the treetrops , leaf by leaf , branch by branch , just as the other species that live in this forest experience it along with the trees themselves .
i went into a clean room with a fresh silicon wafer , and then i just cranked away at all the big machines for about 100 hours .
because if everything is made up of little particles and all the little particles follow quantum mechanics , then shouldn &apos;t everything just follow quantum mechanics ?
and they didn &apos;t die because they didn &apos;t have anthrax anymore .
you &apos;ll notice they all lived , the ones on the top line — that &apos;s a 100 percent survival rate .
put your arms straight down at your side , look up , open your eyes , stare straight ahead , and speak out your question loudly so everybody can hear .
and i watched my own young grandchildren now come along and they &apos;re , much to the distress of my children , they are acting just like we did . you know ? you imprint them .
let me just end by saying that this is what happens when you put africa in a piano , ok .
and i thought to myself , this cpu really has to work like crazy just to keep all this data moving through the system .
what that means is that each reading can be automatically transmitted to servers to be mapped in real time .
this will make it possible for anyone to collect life-saving information and to monitor water quality conditions as they unfold .
nonviolent activists can neutralize the military by causing soldiers to defect .
which means that no matter how destructive and terrible violence is , if people see it as their only choice , they will use it .
and we &apos;ve got a production unit in oxford , or just south of oxford , where we actually produce these mosquitos .
so for the mosquito , it &apos;s a dead end .
and the police estimates that we seize only five percent of what &apos;s being trafficked .
so , i say , &quot; &quot; let &apos;s study more , let &apos;s shed light on this issue , let &apos;s do whatever we can . &quot; &quot; i &apos;m devoting my career to that .
now , there &apos;s a reason why privacy is so craved universally and instinctively .
it &apos;s only those who are dissidents , who challenge power , who have something to worry about .
and in fact , we are in the era of what i would call &quot; &quot; massive-passive &quot; &quot; data collection efforts .
this is a map of eight million phone users in a european country .
so it led us to using design solutions that created as few filters between the viewer — as we said about the families &apos; platform — and the experience as possible .
and also the complexity and length of time they really take to do .
and i &apos;ll tell you , any citizen who wants to be seen and heard not as a prop , not as a talking point , but as a participant , as a creator .
it &apos;s about this passion .
they bring them to the hospital , and they put them in a big jar .
well .
and we showed it to a group of people whose decisions affect the lives of millions of people .
and because of that , you feel her humanity in a deeper way .
the bop is a type of social dance .
now you might recognize this one .
now we have instant neighborhoods outside .
they cram them onto cots , put all your personal belongings in a plastic garbage bag , stick it underneath , and put you on the floor of an entire sports arena , or a gymnasium .
they can literally create water out of thin air .
it allows thousands of people to walk into a mom and pop store and in just five minutes activate the service that gives them two products : an international bank account number and an international debit card .
i mean , our new islamic galleries are a case in point , opened 10 years , almost to the week , after 9 / 11 .
there was a lot of skepticism . on the opening night , i overheard one of the senior members of staff saying , &quot; this is going to be a bomb . &quot;
if you ask people about what part of psychology do they think is hard , and you say , &quot; &quot; well , what about thinking and emotions ? &quot; &quot; most people will say , &quot; &quot; emotions are terribly hard .
so i think the future , main problem of psychology is to classify types of predicaments , types of situations , types of obstacles and also to classify available and possible ways to think and pair them up .
a lot of kids were being referred to me for adhd , or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder , but when i actually did a thorough history and physical , what i found was that for most of my patients , i couldn &apos;t make a diagnosis of adhd .
and then if i were to ask how many folks had a parent who maybe drank too much , or who really believed that if you spare the rod , you spoil the child , i bet a few more hands would go up .
so how far can we go ? one last little bit and i &apos;ll stop .
so we have an ironic problem — good teachers don &apos;t want to go to just those places where they &apos;re needed the most .
this seems most likely .
this is an inorganic tube .
and the only way to do this , because it &apos;s illegal , is to have absolute control of the geographic corridors that are used to transport drugs .
the only thing that the cartels are doing is that they &apos;re trying to protect their business .
so a couple of things i &apos;ve created are , there &apos;s a poster over here that you can play drums on .
it was in far western new south wales .
well , i &apos;m involved in other things , besides physics .
and in western europe mostly try to stay away from any long-distance relationships , big groupings , groupings that go back a long time , longer than the familiar families .
so as i started reading more maslow , what i started to realize is that maslow , later in his life , wanted to take this hierarchy for the individual and apply it to the collective , to organizations and specifically to business .
let me say one thing we can just start doing ten years from now , at least in this country .
how did i get dragged deeper and deeper into an attempt to communicate , giving talks in 10 countries , getting arrested , burning up the vacation time that i had accumulated over 30 years ?
most of the things mentioned in our 1981 paper were facts .
he &apos;s the shaman of the huaorani , and he said to us , you know , i &apos;m an older man now ; i &apos;m getting tired , you know ; i &apos;m tired of spearing these oil workers .
you know , violence as a political tool is all the rage right now .
here &apos;s another example from another piece , and then its realization .
let &apos;s watch a little bit of this , and please notice the instrumentation .
essentially they &apos;ve simulated a city for urban combat , and this is one of the structures that exists in that city .
so i create these two poles .
and the answer is : nothing . there &apos;s nothing in it for the ant .
in jared diamond &apos;s wonderful book , &quot; &quot; guns , germs and steel , &quot; &quot; he talks about how it was germs , more than guns and steel , that conquered the new hemisphere — the western hemisphere — that conquered the rest of the world .
this is a man who terrorized the very vicinity we &apos;re in many years ago . he was known as the santa cruz strangler .
and the strangler says very matter-of-factly , &quot; &quot; oh no . if i &apos;d felt the distress , i could not have done it .
and you &apos;re waiting for your girl .
and when i see all these hexagons and complex things , which i also have , in visual migraine , i wonder whether everyone sees things like this , and whether things like cave art or ornamental art may have been derived from them a bit .
one of the most pervasive problems in the world today for people is inadequate access to clean drinking water .
we can use it for drinking and agriculture .
in essence , could we &quot; &quot; app &quot; &quot; chemistry ?
and if that doesn &apos;t seem fanciful enough , where do you think we &apos;re going to go ?
and in this particular case , this is the climax of the movie , and , you know , the weight of achieving it was simply take a model , throw it out of a helicopter , and shoot it .
i got the feeling that my brain wanted to basically see it come back to life .
mathematical models are used to continuously re-plan a cooperative strategy 50 times per second .
mathematical models tell us exactly when and why this is possible .
now , not only do we have much more education , and much of that education is scientific , and you can &apos;t do science without classifying the world .
he talked to the head man of a person in rural russia .
often what happens is you &apos;re planning so hard for like , &quot; how do i get through the hardest part ? how do i get through the hardest part ? &quot;
you &apos;re climbing on little dimples and nubbins in the rock .
these are extraordinary landscapes , but few of us ever get to see them .
and it &apos;s also estimated that there is going to be twice as much meat and dairy consumed .
we love farmers &apos; markets , we love small family farms , we talk about local food , we eat organic .
i asked him how he became such an expert on fish .
i &apos;m now going to show you the first autonomous generation of power by every child &apos;s favorite plaything .
as you can tell , you need to be a robot to fly this thing for thousands of hours .
so that &apos;s definitely going to get through those 200 nanometer holes .
and how much does it cost ?
that format of forum , at that time , was not well-known outside of japan .
what &apos;s the commercial picture here ?
( laughter ) nk : did you hear that , really ?
it &apos;s something like life , that once you get in it you can &apos;t get out .
so that &apos;s open-source and it can be used in any country where there is some kind of freedom of information law .
and i &apos;ve got to tell you , i wasn &apos;t that hopeful , because i &apos;d seen the establishment . i thought , it always sticks together . i am out of luck .
you see the skeletal structure of it .
ak : and once we put katherine through that particular brand of hell , we knew that we might be able to make a horse , which could be ridden .
it is the market for all those people for whom there is no other market coming .
people are yearning to measure the full distance of their potential on behalf of the causes that they care about deeply .
people aren &apos;t simply projecting identity , they &apos;re creating it .
or what we call the &quot; &quot; sweet gravy , stop me before i kill again ! &quot; &quot; that is actually the device .
we signed the first panel just a few weeks after that , had a great signing ceremony , leading to people hopefully using these products across the world .
we happened to win , just recently , the green product of the year for &quot; &quot; the re-invention of drywall , &quot; &quot; from popular science .
despite centuries of animosity , decades of violence and thousands of people killed , 1998 saw the conclusion of an historic agreement .
leadership needs to be capable , determined and visionary in its commitment to peace .
it &apos;s like a personal flying pet .
that &apos;s kind of the way you communicate .
and when we do have the occasional european success story , even those , then , typically end up being sold to the united states .
maybe you can do it together with other countries .
and , you know , i &apos;m just thinking , &quot; &quot; oh , my god , my whole family got in a van and drove down here from pennsylvania . &quot; &quot; and , you know , i was the only female u.s. sprinter .
so , here we are , a week after the olympics and down at atlanta , and i &apos;m just blown away by the fact that just a year ago , i got out on a gravel track and couldn &apos;t run 50 meters .
( laughter ) and she was like , &quot; &quot; well , it &apos;ll be about you . &quot; &quot; i mean , that &apos;s just incredible humility . ( laughter )
mandela said often that the gift of prison was the ability to go within and to think , to create in himself the things he most wanted for south africa : peace , reconciliation , harmony .
we see it with the openness in cuba .
you know how much turkey would love to have neighbors like that ?
fortunately , we find millions of their remains strewn across the permafrost buried deep in siberia and alaska , and we can actually go up there and actually take them out .
thank you very much .
he didn &apos;t mention the speed . your eye is constantly in motion , moving around , looking at eyes , noses , elbows , looking at interesting things in the world .
it &apos;s a feature-length documentary on consciousness .
( applause ) ew : the full monty .
the johnson sea-link — ( whirring noise ) — which you can probably just barely hear here , uses electric thrusters — very , very quiet .
suppose you &apos;re the cosmic designer .
and the moon is only two seconds away , so if you take a picture of the moon using ordinary light , it &apos;s the moon two seconds ago , and who cares .
and howard is very interested in measuring things .
and it comes out in january , and i hope you all buy it in triplicate .
it &apos;s natural connective tissue .
animals are not just raw materials .
it also has a pneumatic cuff that holds it on , so the more they put themselves under load , the more it attaches .
said he was lucky , because he had his good arm , and then he pushed himself back from the table . he had no legs .
or i could do what i think we &apos;ve all always wanted to do .
i &apos;ve gone too far . so i had to backpedal a little .
that compassion is actually an inherent human quality .
( applause ) if compassion is so good for us , why don &apos;t we train our health care providers in compassion so that they can do what they &apos;re supposed to do , which is to really transform suffering ?
and women grew willing to sham and to bluff .
i only stopped because i thought if i got caught , what would happen to my mother .
so all of this will transform farmers .
in 1984 , in what can only be considered one of the greatest crimes of humanity , nearly one million people died of starvation in my country of birth , ethiopia .
so i couldn &apos;t handle it .
we need to learn how to take this step together .
i &apos;m well aware of the irony of telling you that we will be blogging and tweeting . you &apos;ll be able to live vicariously and virtually through this journey in a way that no one has ever before .
if you cannot understand that there is something in man which responds to the challenge of this mountain and goes out to meet it , that the struggle is the struggle of life itself upward and forever upward , then you won &apos;t see why we go .
that &apos;s exhilarating if you &apos;re doing well , and very crushing if you &apos;re not .
it &apos;s an escape from our own competition , and our own dramas .
here &apos;s that same pupation process , and you can actually see the mites running around in the cells .
now , bees are the most sensitive when they &apos;re developing inside their brood cells , and i wanted to know what that process really looks like , so i teamed up with a bee lab at u.c. davis and figured out how to raise bees in front of a camera .
the results have been nothing short of spectacular .
it &apos;s pretty amazing , isn &apos;t it ?
and one of the things i can do is make it bigger if i want to emphasize it and make it more important .
so i kind of have a — this is bumptop .
now , why is that ? anyone knows , by the way ?
and again , the same story .
and i have been fortunate enough to find things like the first eggs in the western hemisphere and the first baby dinosaurs in nests , the first dinosaur embryos and massive accumulations of bones .
then i just pick things up .
ruby bridges helped to end segregation in the united states .
ask yourself , who &apos;s responsible ? adults .
this is what happens when you route these electrical storms to a loudspeaker and you listen to a hundred brain cells firing , your brain will sound like this — my brain , any brain .
and if she &apos;s doing that , because every time she crosses that target with the little cursor , she gets a drop of brazilian orange juice .
another really surprising part of this picture is that it &apos;s not just the poor who are affected by inequality .
correlation in itself doesn &apos;t prove causality .
there &apos;s an environmental component .
luckily still , it seems to be out of harm &apos;s way of the recent oil spill .
&quot; &quot; like we &apos;re a bunch of elitist , morally-corrupt terrorist-lovers . &quot; &quot; well , she was shocked .
if we &apos;re blind to this simple biology , imagine what we &apos;re missing at the smallest subatomic level right now and at the grandest cosmic levels .
and so guess what , scientists around the world and in the labs are racing to convert aging adult cells — aging adult cells from you and me — they are racing to reprogram these cells back into more useful ips cells .
but the moral controversy surrounding embryonic stem cells — the fact that these cells are derived from five-day old human embryos — has encouraged research into other types of stem cells .
a tremendous amount of ice has been let out of these valleys as it &apos;s retreated and deflated , gone back up valley .
you can stand up there your whole life and you would never see this , but the camera records it .
okay ? no more missing .
grave 15 , what we noticed , was a grave full of women and children , 63 of them .
the air is so rare in this place for me that i can barely breathe .
and i am happy .
but it was so cool because i could write these stories , i could come up with these ideas , and they &apos;d be published in the school paper , and people who i didn &apos;t know could read them .
and we sat in silence for that brief moment , and he said to me , &quot; &quot; you &apos;re really talented . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) &quot; &quot; you &apos;re really good . you know , the school newspaper needs a new cartoonist , and you should be the cartoonist .
he described this expedition as 10 times as dangerous as everest .
i dialed my girlfriend . i dialed the ceo of my sponsor .
and of course , i went to see the rebels in the north .
this was so sickening ; people died because of cartoons .
so unfortunately i &apos;m not smart enough to have a solution for the patent troll problem .
you need to know that the average patent troll defense costs two million dollars and takes 18 months when you win .
the voice is the instrument we all play , and yet how many of us are trained in using our voice ? get trained ; learn to sing , learn to play an instrument .
if you look at these two , eye contact , facing each other , possibly both talking at the same time .
we &apos;re living through one of those moments .
it &apos;s a fantastic example of how technology is creating a market for things that never had a marketplace before .
and he does that every day , and every day , probably , that guy in the picture walks on by , because he sees that little boy , but he doesn &apos;t see him .
and you might think it &apos;s just good karma to see these guys stirring shit , but it &apos;s also good economic sense , because they &apos;re saving a million dollars a year .
we know that if you stimulate the temporal lobe , you can produce a feeling of out-of-body experiences , near-death experiences , which you can do by just touching an electrode to the temporal lobe there .
or you can do it through loss of consciousness , by accelerating in a centrifuge .
what if we could study people from the time that they were teenagers all the way into old age to see what really keeps people happy and healthy ?
and i &apos;m the fourth director of the study .
so i wanted people to really get the sense that they had received something that could have been a love letter to them .
this is a piece that i did for the guardian newspaper in the u.k.
and i want you to really watch closely these little white dots on the screen , because , over the five-day period , what they do is extend out and through this material , using the energy that &apos;s contained in these seed husks to build this chitinous polymer matrix .
and because they &apos;re made of natural materials , they are 100 percent compostable in you own backyard .
less is not always more .
place your foot just so , mind how you turn : too swift a swivel can bring you down .
titus was so bitter .
in one of the first studies we did , we used suggestion , a method inspired by the psychotherapy we saw in these cases , we used this kind of suggestion and planted a false memory that when you were a kid , five or six years old , you were lost in a shopping mall .
thanks to my ancestors for robbing me of my invention . ( laughter ) through bowmaking , i came in contact with part of my heritage .
did it strike you ?
the second thing that could happen is that some young genius will arrive , and say , &quot; &quot; i &apos;ve found it .
there is only one circumstance in which they always , all of them , walk on two legs , and that is when they are wading through water .
pickles ?
and even in poughkeepsie , my hometown , we thought about old industrial infrastructure .
so , naturally , i had my vest and my identification .
i would not have my new hip for ted2008 .
you will basically not be able to distinguish them , and the exception , of course , will be guinness .
and then , what level of inequality do we want to have ?
now how do we cope and deal with that ?
he adds some more . he adds some more . and then something weird happens .
the three plants are areca palm , mother-in-law &apos;s tongue and money plant .
and the study showed that , compared to other buildings , there is a reduced incidence of eye irritation by 52 percent , respiratory systems by 34 percent , headaches by 24 percent , lung impairment by 12 percent and asthma by nine percent .
yet , despite all the advances in medical technology , the diagnosis of brain disorders in one in six children still remained so limited .
and another program called statistical probability mapping then performs mathematical calculations to determine whether any of these abnormalities are clinically significant , allowing us to provide a much more accurate neurological diagnosis of the child &apos;s symptoms .
several times we can repeat that .
let &apos;s see . yeah , it worked .
the overlong ears , the overlarge feet , helps us to picture , to feel intuitively , what it means to limp and to tremble .
so what you have is an atmosphere of vulnerability and tension .
like i said , pollen carries the male sex cells .
here are some examples — they &apos;re very smooth if you look at them — of tree pollen that is meant to be carried by the wind .
( laughter ) i cut stories .
and it &apos;s still growing .
after a very bad stroke , his ageless soul watches the changes in the body with tenderness , and he is grateful to the people who help him .
( applause )
i was one of the only kids in college who had a reason to go to the p.o. box at the end of the day , and that was mainly because my mother has never believed in email , in facebook , in texting or cell phones in general .
i blogged about those letters and the days when they were necessary , and i posed a kind of crazy promise to the internet : that if you asked me for a hand-written letter , i would write you one , no questions asked .
dear brothers and sisters , when malala was born , and for the first time , believe me , i don &apos;t like newborn children , to be honest , but when i went and i looked into her eyes , believe me , i got extremely honored .
thank you very much .
but how do you do that ?
these economics i &apos;m proposing , it &apos;s like 20th century medicine .
it could perhaps be a self-organizing system , so that was the second bit that i wanted to tell you , that children can self-organize and attain an educational objective .
so i leave you with this third question .
i have strategically cut matt &apos;s head out of this photo , because he would kill me if he knew i was using it because of the sweatsuits .
the entire county is home to just 20,000 people , and they &apos;re very sparsely distributed .
it was unacceptable .
we went about getting evidence of what was going on .
see , the problem wasn &apos;t that i didn &apos;t have any interests — it &apos;s that i had too many .
idea synthesis , rapid learning and adaptability : three skills that multipotentialites are very adept at , and three skills that they might lose if pressured to narrow their focus .
i have laid down my life fighting the infidels . &quot; &quot; then god will look at my intention .
how do the taliban in your area get people to join them ?
so what we need to know to even address this mystery is , number one , how are minds are put together in the brain , and , number two , how selves are constructed .
so in order to have a conscious mind , you have a self within the conscious mind .
but universally , these people that had been through this had astounding attitudes , and just the fact that people care makes a huge difference to them .
i literally could not sleep thinking about , &quot; &quot; i wonder how you &apos;d roll over with no shoulders . &quot; &quot; so , i decided we &apos;ve got to do this .
stay tuned for that .
and the individual has 2 billion of these nano-size split ends .
what you can see is there &apos;s about six different colors , and each color represents a type of wood to be cut , a piece of wood to be cut .
you &apos;re underneath it , looking up into the lens of the camera obscura .
what happens when you have a star that &apos;s right on the edge of that mass ?
now that &apos;s an incredible phenomena , because it &apos;s a star that sits there .
and this year , the us team is in great shape .
but behind , the average team is trying to catch up .
remove the second tv .
you need also to increase reciprocity , by removing the buffers that make us self-sufficient .
and industry can accelerate too , doubling its energy productivity with a 21 percent internal rate of return .
plus better lights and office equipment and such cut the maximum cooling load by a third .
so i thought , &quot; &quot; i wonder what &apos;ll happen if i put the two together ? &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) ( applause ) and the underwater wheelchair that has resulted has taken me on the most amazing journey over the last seven years .
( applause )
you have to give to receive .
adam ii is the humble side of our nature .
public bathrooms .
but they do for sure make the world more dangerous for some of us .
so , he had to focus each tube just to get the memory up and running , let alone having , you know , software problems .
it &apos;s a world that von neumann himself envisioned .
( applause ) thank you . ( applause )
eventually , after a period of six months of brutal war and a toll rate of almost 50,000 dead , we managed to liberate our country and to topple the tyrant .
i need help , and i can &apos;t help diana . &quot; &quot; so that was at eight o &apos;clock at night .
you &apos;d think you &apos;d be singing leonard cohen &apos;s &quot; &quot; hallelujah &quot; &quot; out in the majesty of the ocean , not songs about heroin addiction in new york city .
we get so little news about the developing world that we often forget that there are literally millions of people out there struggling to change things to be fairer , freer , more democratic , less corrupt .
you can start to know where things are .
this photograph , which i took at the orphanage of one of the classrooms , shows a sign which i had translated when i got home .
something is said in the gaps between all the information that &apos;s collected .
there is a new face of kilimanjaro without ice .
we have to believe what we know .
they &apos;re reminiscent , of course , of wires .
we have many , many images as babies and we get told , &quot; &quot; this is a bird ; this is not a bird . &quot; &quot; and over time , through iteration , we solve for w , we solve for those neural connections .
it is a very difficult battle .
in fact , it &apos;s not just a matter of equity .
and , of course those are the remains , and they &apos;re so labeled .
the idea was — and it was a brilliant idea — was to have 10 posters distributed throughout the city &apos;s subway system so every time you got on the subway you &apos;d be passing a different poster , all of which had a different idea of what art is .
that &apos;s a guess .
i &apos;ll get the nitwit on the network news saying , &quot; we &apos;ll be back in a moment with more on the crisis . &quot;
the light blue is refugee camps these volunteers had spotted from the &#91; satellite images &#93; .
yes , certainly you can do it over here .
i think of this woman named islan nettles .
gender has always been considered a fact , immutable , but we now know it &apos;s actually more fluid , complex and mysterious .
they made bigger guns to shoot them down with .
well , these guys measured all of those things .
but it was very labor intensive .
so now i &apos;m not specifying a single ratio anymore to fold it , but instead i &apos;m establishing a rule , i &apos;m establishing a link between a property of a surface and how that surface is folded .
i have a little cuban mother — she &apos;s about that big .
&quot; oh , jesus . &quot;
all right .
and so , i don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve ever had this , but when i close my eyes sometimes and try to sleep , i can &apos;t stop thinking about my own eyes .
so , in a way , the different structure is that we &apos;re partners , it &apos;s a partnership . we can continue to work and dedicate ourselves to this project , and then we also share in the rewards .
but when nicholas negroponte — and he has spoken about this project a lot , he &apos;s the founder of olpc — came to us about two and a half years ago , there were some clear ideas .
true land plants arose , leafless at first .
but there were witnesses , survivors in the dark .
i &apos;m a contemporary artist with a bit of an unexpected background .
those are actually all real butterfly specimens .
well one of them is , they say , you need to get the basics first .
well , another issue people bring up is somehow that hand calculating procedures teach understanding .
and tiger woods , for a long time , the perfect brand ambassador .
so this says that it &apos;s impossible , by definition , to measure exactly the state — i.e. , the position — and the momentum of a particle , because the act of measuring it , by definition , changes it .
and they actually do .
he could not move his body , but he could imagine the movements needed to kick a ball .
my story begins right here actually in rajasthan about two years ago .
so it says , &quot; &quot; place your fingers upon each light . &quot; &quot; and so — ( music ) it says , &quot; &quot; this box belongs to ... &quot; &quot; and so i type in my name .
it gives it information . by adding information to matter , it gives it a function that &apos;s different than without that structure .
life — and this is the secret trick ; this is the magic trick — life creates conditions conducive to life .
it &apos;s a 50 / 50 shot of a thousand or 2,000 , or just 1,500 dollars with certainty .
sometimes he gives no loss , so the monkeys are really psyched , but sometimes he actually gives a big loss , taking away two to give the monkeys only one .
to make the future rather than wait for it .
( applause )
and you know who we love ? jack .
but i am here to tell you , no matter what your walls are made of , a closet is no place for a person to live .
at the end of the season , you actually don &apos;t want it to rain , because rains then can damage the crop .
we devise agronomic algorithms which tell us how much rainfall a crop needs and when .
and this is good because it means we should be able to strike a balance , to come up with plans and rules to protect ourselves from unrealistic optimism , but at the same time remain hopeful .
if we expect the future to be bright , stress and anxiety are reduced .
i &apos;d never seen anything like that .
i directed a movie two years ago called &quot; &quot; step up 2 : the streets . &quot; &quot; anybody ? anybody ? yeah !
as one grad put it , in cuba , &quot; &quot; we are trained to provide quality care with minimal resources , so when i see all the resources we have here , and you tell me that &apos;s not possible , i know it &apos;s not true .
by 2020 , we will be short 45,000 primary care physicians .
we &apos;re going to see this evolution really in two phases , i think . the first phase of the open government revolution is delivering better information from the crowd into the center .
we &apos;ve heard talk here at ted about people biohacking and hacking their plants with arduino , and mozilla is doing work around the world in getting young people to build websites and make videos .
i have a problem .
it &apos;s more than making nice sounds , and it &apos;s more than making nice songs .
take , even , osama bin laden .
i don &apos;t know the people who wrote all the books and articles that i read in preparation for this talk .
but in 2007 , at the height of the sub-prime and all the complicated financial structures , it was quite opposite to the reckless risk-taking behaviors that we saw on the market .
what does that mean ?
a coconut tree that is 90 feet tall , and has coconuts that weigh two pounds that can drop off at any time .
that if you wear your socks on the outside rather than the inside , you &apos;re much more likely to survive and not slip and fall .
will we be quick enough to react before millions die ?
and that would create a universal hiv vaccine .
i grew up watching whoopi goldberg , roseanne barr , ellen , and all of these women had one thing in common : they were comedians .
suddenly , my disability on the world wide web is fair game .
and it &apos;s a project that we &apos;ve actually been now joined by hundreds of people around the world , who are doing it with us . indeed thousands of people have actually been involved in this project , in many of its different aspects .
it causes these vast bleaching events that are the first signs of corals of being sick .
he was a college professor at a state school ; he knows what paperwork looks like .
would they give me charts and graphs that i could color ?
there &apos;s a sweet spot where originals seem to live .
yes , that &apos;s an actual term .
will never gather up all the plastic and put the ocean back together again .
notice that the bottles here have caps on them .
when you put them together , they behave like one high-performance quadrocopter .
it can move anywhere it wants in space irrespective of where it is facing and even of how it is rotating .
( laughter ) so at the end of this , he sent us an email , and this is what the email said : &quot; &quot; that was the first time i &apos;ve drawn anything for seven years .
and we &apos;ve got such a long way to go with this .
and i don &apos;t know about all of you , but i have trouble keeping 100 things in my head at once .
i mean , it could be somebody &apos;s health , it could be somebody &apos;s career , something important to them .
thank you .
one of the best ways of killing mosquitos is not to wait until they fly around like adults and bite people and transmit disease .
nobody really expected much from people at work or in society because all the expectations then were about home and family responsibilities .
&quot; what is england and why am i going there ? &quot;
in contrast , asian-american children performed best when they believed their mothers had made the choice , second best when they chose for themselves , and least well when it had been chosen by miss smith .
during the very first session , which was run in russia , one of the participants made a comment that really caught me off guard .
some of the firemen told me that they were also inspired to do better because they were so pleased to get thank-yous rather than brick bats .
paradoxically , when i let go of these objectives , and worked from a place of compassion and purpose , looking for excellence , rather than the results of it , everything arrived on its own , including fulfillment .
but out there , those lowest of the lows are so often contrasted with the highest of the highs .
if we could build an economy that would use things rather than use them up , we could build a future that really could work in the long term .
they &apos;d buy it from the shop as raw ingredients .
and two of the most expensive tissues in our human body are nervous tissue and digestive tissue .
that means improvise .
i don &apos;t do special physical training .
( applause ) ( music ) ( applause ) angella ahn : thank you . ( applause )
and he insisted on beautiful music .
it &apos;s also about thinking about the creative spirit and nurturing it , and imagining , particularly in urban america , about the nurturing of the spirit .
harlem now , sort of explaining and thinking of itself in this part of the century , looking both backwards and forwards ...
this is me now . and you can see the ecg .
so this is the moment-by-moment , or minute-by-minute sleep .
vexillological .
( music ) now , milwaukee is a fantastic city .
there are many ways in which i &apos;m doing feminism wrong .
when i drive to work , i listen to thuggish rap at a very loud volume .
once upon a time , he told me , all animals on earth were one .
( applause )
so once those cells are on the patient they will stick where they need to be .
and then finally you &apos;re able to get that structure out .
one of the most unique things that bats do as a mammal is that they fly .
your genome is made up of your dna , your dna codes for proteins that enable you to function and interact and be as you are .
be advised , we &apos;re leaving taji right now .
i later heard that iraqi casualties were not to be treated in taji .
the walls are made of absorptive surface , half absorptive , half reflective , which is not very good for concert sound .
but what i wanted to do was take a couple of seconds that i have left to just talk about the hall itself , which is kind of where we &apos;re really doing a massive amount of work .
do you even need a brain at all just to synchronize ?
a computer is , in a way , just another experiment .
( laughter ) there &apos;s a whole programming language and robotics tool , so if you want to teach someone how to program , kid , adult , whatever it is .
bought him this .
our oceans are sacred .
the deepest red i &apos;ve ever seen in my life lives underwater .
what &apos;s happening is that , because the boat changes shape , the position of the front sail and the main sail are different to the wind .
less than one week after , this is a team in eindhoven , it &apos;s a school of engineering .
darwin &apos;s laws don &apos;t change , but now there &apos;s a new kind of player on the field and things begin to look very different .
so within the team , their interests are actually pitted against each other .
but that was not the end of the story .
and so this is just a regular video of the animal just smashing the heck out of this load cell .
( noisy conversation ) this study in germany found the average noise level in classrooms is 65 decibels .
so office sound is a huge area , and incidentally , noise in offices has been shown to make people less helpful , less enjoy their teamwork , and less productive at work .
we give them a friendly face and a reassuring voice .
now he &apos;s asleep . let &apos;s wake him up .
now language &apos;s subversive power has been recognized throughout the ages in censorship , in books you can &apos;t read , phrases you can &apos;t use and words you can &apos;t say .
now you might say , well , this is just natural .
now , some of you might hear this and feel sad .
so i ask these questions by way of a few generations of struggle .
when it asked people to rate it on terms of the quality of the working alliance , people rated the robot higher and they trusted the robot more .
( applause )
would more people show up ?
we tell the story at the exact time during the night .
so on that frame , the children who are typical are watching this , the emotion of expression of that little boy as he &apos;s fighting a little bit with the little girl .
the caregiver seeks the baby .
which is why i was surprised a few months later to see her back in our own town , getting her subsequent care with her private oncologist .
and tate asked fildes to paint a painting of social importance .
it doesn &apos;t have to be .
and i have a little sign on my fridge , and it says , &quot; because i &apos;m the daddy , that &apos;s why . &quot;
and it &apos;s not a banal story — after the liberation he continued to make false papers until the &apos; 70s .
and while my half brother and sister thought they &apos;d been abandoned , orphaned , my father was making false papers .
this is actually a direct quote from an epidemiologist who &apos;s been in field of hiv for 15 years , worked on four continents , and you &apos;re looking at her .
let &apos;s just stop treating people . &quot; &quot; of course not , of course not .
and they always overheat the hotels in korea terribly , so during the day i always left the window open .
so , my friend gene flew over with his son , tim .
you &apos;re actually seeing and hearing quantum information flow .
the white dots are the probability wave that will show you where the electron is in any given point of time and space in this particular three-orbital configuration .
unlike an aircraft carrier or an atomic bomb , you don &apos;t need a massive manufacturing system to build robotics . a lot of it is off the shelf . a lot of it &apos;s even do-it-yourself .
a robots revolution is upon us .
so , that &apos;s the second path .
what you get out of that is not smiley-ness .
if antoine de saint-exupery , the author of &quot; &quot; the little prince , &quot; &quot; were here , he would have drawn three holes inside that box and told you your sheep was inside .
in the art of today , we become scientists .
this was , at a distance , realizing that someone was feeling something , wanting to affect them in a particular way , using media to do it , putting it online and realizing that there was a greater impact .
( laughter ) but this was the emotional moment .
that is what i need for my characters in my books : a passionate heart .
but given a choice , i would rather have the warrior hearts of wangari maathai , somaly mam , jenny and rose mapendo .
and then our relationship stopped .
we didn &apos;t make phone calls like normal human beings do and say , you know , &quot; &quot; this is over . &quot; &quot; we walked the great wall of china to say goodbye .
how important is this ?
so you have an image , a retina , and a brain .
anyway , we had a major cultural issue .
now , i work in acute care .
this is the point when people started asking me , &quot; andrew , can you make body parts out of apples ? &quot;
but here &apos;s the thing , for me , garbage is just a chance to play , to be creative and build things to amuse myself .
there was this whole fancy diplomatic system , this negotiation process about the future of kosovo , and the kosovars weren &apos;t part of it .
and we use naive experts who may know nothing about the countries we &apos;re dealing with , but may know something about something else to try to inject new thinking into the problems that we try to address for our clients .
and it doesn &apos;t just end in fifth grade .
perfection or bust .
now , i don &apos;t know if any of you have had the opportunity to go to mt . everest , but it &apos;s quite an ordeal getting up there .
instead of swimming crawl , swim breaststroke .
so when one-liners were really popular , everybody stole them from one another .
for fashionistas , they want to stay ahead of the curve .
but it &apos;s taken all stakeholders , working together — teachers and principals on one-year contracts , working over and above and beyond their contract hours without compensation .
so even though teachers were against it because we employ one-year contracts — you can &apos;t teach , or you don &apos;t want to teach , you don &apos;t get to be at my school with my kids .
( laughter ) no , they were really big geeks , and they didn &apos;t know much about art .
and they said you have to say bye to her , you have to do what you have to do .
just this one example is worth a lot of work .
i used to be a fan of bach .
it doesn &apos;t matter what your religion is ; even if you &apos;re an atheist , you don &apos;t raise your kid telling him , you know , &quot; make sure you lie three times a day . &quot;
then there &apos;s a group that believes the koran is a living , breathing document , and i captured that idea within these stones that self-update .
( laughter ) but it raises the question : are we just trying to hide away these extra dimensions , or do they tell us something about the world ?
in our era , a new approach to unify the laws of physics is being pursued by physicists such as myself , many others around the world , it &apos;s called superstring theory , as you were indicating .
and we , as now the elite , parents , librarians , professionals , whatever it is , a bunch of our activities are , in fact , in trying to get the best we have to offer within reach of those around us , or as broadly as we can .
if we can have mars rovers , you &apos;d think you could turn pages .
they ran the code .
so it &apos;s not really a clear win for pass phrases .
they package it with the red ribbon that reminds us of hiv , put it in boxes that remind you who paid for them , show pictures of your wife or husband and tell you to protect them or to act prudently .
it might just save their lives .
they use his rhetoric .
and it filled this old imam , it filled him with great sadness .
we had a car that came by , same identical car as described by the teenagers , right ?
that &apos;s 30 feet away .
we can do more work to really bring it down so that by the end of the century , it &apos;s not much more than there is now .
we do still use fortran .
remember when this blue box was all alone , leading the world , living its own life .
child survival is the new green .
the world is likely to lose one third of its arable land by the end of the century .
in a period of unprecedented population growth and increased food demands , this could prove disastrous .
the main purpose was to control the society .
the cheka was an instrument of the communists to establish their regime by terrorizing the population and executing their enemies .
and they are exaggerated , and especially things we &apos;re afraid of .
that &apos;s you .
thank you .
so everything you see within the finished piece is exactly where it was in the book before i began .
and because bacteria can pass their dna to each other like a traveler handing off a suitcase at an airport , once we have encouraged that resistance into existence , there is no knowing where it will spread .
there are companies working on novel antibiotics , things the superbugs have never seen before .
most of our planet is in eternal darkness .
we were looking for something and found something else .
it &apos;s called regulation .
but it is a world that &apos;s going to exist , and it is going to be a better world .
well , it turns out that the data shows a four percent increase in repayment among people who consistently communicate with a few close contacts .
she &apos;s lived her whole life believing that there was a part of the world that was closed off to her .
i started to build a prototype like that .
how do you cast mud ?
simple .
there &apos;s not a food today that &apos;s more maligned than foie gras , right ?
we can turn it up or down , on or off .
we started using this technique in other problems , and i &apos;m going to tell you about a fascinating problem that we encountered , a case of dystonia .
and amy did what any of us would : she filmed it .
they were praising dr. king as his style of activism was branded as terrorism if done in the name of animals or the environment .
( music ) thank you . thank you .
so all of this is pretty innovative , if you consider that the hurdy-gurdy appeared about a thousand years ago and it took two people to play it ; one to turn the crank , and another person — yes — to play the melody by physically pulling up large wooden pegs .
why is it important now ?
they &apos;re frequent travelers .
would we return to a better state of creation ? &quot; &quot; so we looked for that biblical material , that fruit-bearing fruit tree kind of material , and we found it .
in our next project , we explore the possibility of creating a cape and skirt — this was for a paris fashion show with iris van herpen — like a second skin that are made of a single part , stiff at the contours , flexible around the waist .
somi .
hey , yeah !
so how do we bring that to something that we understand ?
it &apos;s a miracle that we feed seven billion people with just a few of us involved in the production of food .
most of them don &apos;t pick up a rifle .
international organizations , non-governmental organizations , private voluntary organizations , contractors .
the green line is the number of bike lanes .
they changed signals , they changed lanes , everything they could do to make times square work better .
will we all become slaves to algorithms and utility functions ?
bitcoin is the most ubiquitous cryptocurrency , but there are hundreds of them .
it &apos;s a natural antibiotic .
how much is it going to take to contaminate humans ?
it &apos;s pretty hot .
and as we try to lift billions of people out of poverty in the third world , in the developing world , we &apos;re using energy faster and faster .
instead of staining all of the cells inside of a tissue , it somehow only stains about one percent of them .
and that &apos;s because today we can see what &apos;s inside of the brain , rather than just looking at its overall shape .
we justify the burning , as scientists , because it does remove the dead material and it allows the plants to grow .
what are we going to do ?
she told us that her symptoms had improved by 90 percent .
health is not just a personal responsibility or phenomenon .
man 2 : you have the back legs ? no , you have the front legs , my friend .
so we were the first to actually name a bird from the famous series that later exploded onto the pages of science and nature .
what we do , we &apos;re a pay-it-forward kind of group , where it &apos;s composed of gardeners from all walks of life , from all over the city , and it &apos;s completely volunteer , and everything we do is free .
for instance , the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times higher than , say , beverly hills , which is probably eight , 10 miles away .
there are now a couple of security doors , so you won &apos;t see it quite like this .
and my final thought is that we , of course , by conserving wheat , rice , potatoes , and the other crops , we may , quite simply , end up saving ourselves .
but wigler , besides looking at cancer cells , looked at normal cells , and made a really sort of surprising observation .
i mean , big piece at the molecular level .
by giving kids a free school meal , it gets them into school , which is obviously education , the first step out of poverty , but it also gives them the micronutrients and the macronutrients they need to really develop both mentally and physically .
it &apos;s the thirtieth anniversary of gmo crops and the big gulp , chicken mcnuggets , high fructose corn syrup , the farm crisis in america and the change in how we &apos;ve addressed agriculture internationally .
myself and other women had a seat at the table .
i decided to use their defense as my offense , and i began to cite and highlight islamic scripture as well .
there &apos;s this thing called the law of physics , and part of the law of physics is the thing called the diffraction limit .
one has opened our eyes to a completely new universe , and the other attacks long-held beliefs .
ad hominem attacks will get you nowhere .
you can send them an email .
so there &apos;s about 130 million books that have been written since the dawn of time .
so what kind of historical mechanism can produce that ?
it &apos;s about industry as opposed to the survival of a people .
and it &apos;s very inspiring to hear you say you &apos;re going to fight to the end to try to preserve the nation in a location .
we &apos;ve actually tried to turn it into an electrical engineering lab .
and they &apos;re great . we can make great little sculptures with these .
now , it &apos;s no secret , because i like collecting things , that i love the natural history museum and the collections of animals at the natural history museum in dioramas .
so i decided to create a piece which is a self-portrait piece .
what we did was essentially canceling gravity and controlling the movement by combining magnetic levitation and mechanical actuation and sensing technologies .
at mit media lab , along with my advisor hiroshi ishii and my collaborator rehmi post , we created this one physical pixel .
they were not eaten , they were thrown away because they were dead .
and he was here , as you well know , in &apos; 35 .
it &apos;s called the worldwide telescope , and i want to thank ted and microsoft for allowing me to bring it to your attention .
in 1920 , for example , you weren &apos;t allowed to drink ; if you were a woman , you weren &apos;t allowed to vote ; and if you looked up at the stars and the milky way on a summer night , what you saw was thought to be the entire universe .
so this is a first indication that the &quot; &quot; all brains are made the same way &quot; &quot; scenario is not quite right .
i &apos;ve been digging through the literature for the original reference for that number , and i could never find it .
remarkably , the answer is yes .
valence means good or bad , positive or negative .
and you know , the funny thing about this is that it &apos;s hard to see .
in 1915 , it &apos;s not like newspapers were sweating a lot about their civic responsibilities .
we started to publish every week sessions on the internet .
vm : i think you break it with your body , more than with your knowledge .
but i believe we &apos;re on a path now , when we get to data , that we can distill styles , and templates , and formulas , and all these kinds of things , again , that you &apos;ve seen happen in the computer graphics world .
we have a process where we , you know , kind of put it into the computer and digitize it , and then a whole lot of analysis .
so someone who says they hate immigrants , i try to imagine how scared they must be that their community is changing from what they &apos;ve always known .
political persuasion begins with being emotionally correct .
things die when there &apos;s no food .
here &apos;s a female that &apos;s in a hurry . she &apos;s got food .
can it change the footprint that you &apos;ll ultimately leave on the world ?
a restaurant with an open-air kitchen .
it &apos;s really just the structure that we &apos;re talking about .
now , one in three people living in cities today actually live in a slum .
and that &apos;s what comes to the first step here .
that &apos;s why in negotiations , often , when things get tough , people go for walks in the woods .
let &apos;s see if they might actually understand what that means .
now the mother you see here is mugsy .
and it &apos;s not to go out and buy 100 or 1,000 , though , i invite you to do that , and 10,000 would be even better .
and we hope if you have eg two years from now , or whenever you have it again , i won &apos;t have bad breath , and i will be invited back , and will have , hopefully by then , maybe 100 million out there to children .
and the students wanted to speak to the government , and police answered with bullets .
so it was on the 10th of june , and they came , and they surrounded the house , and my grandmother switched off all the lights in the house , and opened the kitchen door .
why did he do all this ?
but for the past eight years , i &apos;ve done something completely different .
and at that time two years ago i mentioned that we were speculating that these jets might in fact be geysers , and erupting from pockets or chambers of liquid water underneath the surface , but we weren &apos;t really sure .
this region seen here for the first time in the cassini image taken in 2005 . this is the south polar region , with the famous tiger-stripe fractures crossing the south pole .
is it metabolized in the liver ?
but mucus is actually very important .
and so i come to my wish .
you really can make this change happen .
which is curious as we debate all this stuff . but as you think of coal , this is what burned wheat kernels look like . not entirely unlike coal .
managing this system .
he experienced weightlessness and re-entry months before the first human being to do it , soviet cosmonaut yuri gagarin .
something between 20 and 25 percent of all life forms on the planet , including plants , are beetles .
matters of principle aside , practically speaking , these laws drive hiv underground .
and i think the severity of that punishment tells you how bad you are as a person .
and when i place the superconducting disk on top of this rail , it moves freely .
so , this is quantum locking — actually locking — three-dimensional locking of the superconductor .
gbm affects about 10,000 people in the u.s. each year .
( video ) robert dill-bundi : my quality of life , i rate what i have today a bit different than what most people would assume .
and the consensus was : it really worked .
and it &apos;s very powerful because everyone gets to see everything else .
it also doesn &apos;t need a lot of land , something that &apos;s in short supply , compared to other protein sources .
saving the oceans can feed the world .
nature feeds the heart cells in your body with a very , very dense blood supply .
what does this mean for us ?
one was a passion for rodents .
just as an indication , whereas a microscopist can process 40 samples in a day , a rat can process the same amount of samples in seven minutes only .
you &apos;ll find a stair that &apos;s the same length as the supreme court .
but we took the air conditioning out of the tower .
you have to hire people who know what they &apos;re doing .
software has done this in a way that &apos;s been very visible , because it &apos;s measurable . but the thing to see is that this actually happens throughout the web .
the biosphere is the size of the earth .
we know that .
let &apos;s say they do 30 miles per gallon .
but there used to be a whole load of people .
and i think there &apos;s a point between simplicity and ambiguity which can allow a viewer to perhaps take something from it .
the next piece i &apos;ll show you is a much more conceptual thought , and it &apos;s a little piece called &quot; &quot; cory &apos;s yellow chair . &quot; &quot; i had this image in my mind , when i saw my son &apos;s little chair , and i saw it explode up and out .
and no one can get more than $ 100 a month .
and in six months they can become solar engineers .
( laughter ) three women together , be careful , it &apos;s adultery .
the symbol of the door looks like a pair of saloon doors in the wild west .
in 2009 , tuhin and i were pursuing our postgraduation in design .
we feel awkward and shameful talking about it .
and they have about 110,000 people spread out over 33 islands .
sea levels are rising , and kiribati , along with 42 other nations in the world , will be under water within 50 to 100 years due to climate change and the associated sea-level rise from thermal expansion and the melting of freshwater into the ocean .
now you put water into a cup .
it didn &apos;t look indian anymore .
and of course , our change in standards can outpace the change in behavior . one of the reasons violence went down is that people got sick of the carnage and cruelty in their time .
well , let &apos;s click the zoom lens down one order of magnitude , and look at the century scale .
well , there are primarily two ways .
to look at the financials of your business , understand the story that the financials tell , and either take appropriate action or make appropriate recommendations ? &quot; &quot; and to a man , they said , &quot; that &apos;s a given . &quot;
( laughter ) huh ? maybe google would hire this .
( applause )
it &apos;s far from perfect , obviously .
my family and i were lucky ; our place is still standing .
yes , they chose a cartoon , ok ?
and i didn &apos;t want them to grow up with a secret .
i am going to cite the possibility of being whole , which is within our experience , everybody &apos;s experience .
and there is no way of your being not limitless too .
that , under all circumstances , they have pushed the boundary .
these are some of the images and the characters of the film .
and i don &apos;t think it should , because a lot of the movie , i don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve seen it , but a lot of the movie takes place in this embassy where men and women are hiding out during the hostage crisis .
it has not yet caught on and caught fire , but maybe today we will start a movement .
my true love lives up the river ; a few more jumps and i &apos;ll be with her .
( laughter ) she said , &quot; &quot; would you put them to work ? &quot; &quot; well , that must have seemed like a funny idea to that foreman : put these two middle-class little white boys out in a cotton field in august in texas — it &apos;s hot .
you cannot separate the buildings out from the infrastructure of cites and the mobility of transit .
the library of the free university , which opened last year , is an example of that .
my right leg will be unburdened , my right foot will freely meet the wire .
one solution was to rehearse a machine gun delivery in which every syllable , every second will have its importance and hope to god the audience will be able to follow me .
first they have cleaned the society , then it will be hyderabad , and soon india .
for our auction we have some wonderful paintings for you , for a very good cause , the money you give us will be used to buy hearing aids .
this was a tragedy , but it really forced us to refocus what it is that we were doing .
they send him to iraq .
how do you decide what is important ?
and it &apos;s a community around it that has decided to build this .
when viruses infect a cell , they inject their dna .
bg : there &apos;s a big meeting happening in december that you and your colleagues are calling , together with the national academy of sciences and others , what do you hope will come out of the meeting , practically ?
they fly 65,000 kilometers in less than a year .
many species are headed through this region , which is why there &apos;s been so much attention put into conservation of the eastern tropical pacific seascape .
and another idea that i had as well , that was brought forward by an ecologist — he basically did a calculation where he took one liter of gas and said , well , how much carbon it would take , and how much organic material ?
and then the third one is this idea of the end of oil , this entropic end , where all of our parts of cars , our tires , oil filters , helicopters , planes — where are the landscapes where all of that stuff ends up ?
and i came up with these .
all of these are extracted directly from my bank accounts , and everything pops up right away .
and there &apos;s a very unique sense of pessimism that &apos;s moved in .
so one reason is obviously economic or structural .
and so when i was first living in new york city a few years back , i was thinking a lot about the familiar architectural forms that surrounded me and how i would like to better relate to them .
it physically carves out conversation space for one .
i think we can afford to be optimistic .
in our liberal democracies , we have a semblance of democracy .
it &apos;s the continents that moved them .
and it turns out , there &apos;s lots of new cavefish species out there .
after some time , however , we had a tentative answer .
was there a neurological cause for their condition ?
because they are so expensive , there aren &apos;t very many of them .
and a new generation of engineers and scientists , mostly out of universities , began launching these very small , breadbox-sized satellites called cubesats .
so i &apos;ve been up here a little over 10 minutes , i &apos;ve already lost three papers .
so we have this remarkably efficient system for beating any interest in science out of everybody &apos;s head .
it was the first computer animation any of us had ever seen .
and then the whole room was clapping .
i was lying on a thin , hard spinal bed .
he said , &quot; &quot; would you like to have a go at taxiing ? &quot; &quot; that &apos;s when you use your feet to control the rudder pedals to control the airplane on the ground .
but i decided that i wanted to go and see if i could affect change there .
but my great grandfather , henry ford , really believed that the mission of the ford motor company was to make people &apos;s lives better and make cars affordable so that everyone could have them .
well , a few things .
the middle class is spending more on schooling too , but in the global educational arms race that starts at nursery school and ends at harvard , stanford or mit , the 99 percent is increasingly outgunned by the one percent .
and we know there are groups all the way to ethiopia .
have you seen changes ?
first component is you charge the car whenever you stop — ends up that cars are these strange beasts that drive for about two hours and park for about 22 hours .
and those are not 20 percent by 2020 .
so , here is what happens , right here , the beginning of my flesh at the lower part of my arm i just make a little pierce .
what happens is this .
in omagh , bomb went off , real ira , middle of a peace process .
well , reducing the market is really one for governments and civil society . we &apos;ve got to show we &apos;re better .
a detachable , swimming penis .
it &apos;s a very simple genetically inherited trait and the males are not otherwise any different .
as i started this work , it was not always easy to convince the women to participate .
those images were then shared in some of the classrooms , and worked to inspire and motivate other women going through similar educations and situations .
the really sad thing is , in many parts of the world , we &apos;re raised to believe that strangers are dangerous by default , that we can &apos;t trust them , that they might hurt us .
they have something else .
you &apos;d still have five &#91; million &#93; pounds in change , and people would ask for the trains to be slowed down .
and we have no knowledge whatsoever of the quality of those things , but we look at a combined tv and dvd player and we go , &quot; &quot; uck .
and that is , why is it that countries with seemingly similar economies and institutions can display radically different savings behavior ?
yes , because i just told you , we actually collect a lot of health data as economists .
glaciers and sea ice that have been with us for millennia are now disappearing in a matter of decades .
( applause )
( laughter ) and well , that was an opera experience .
other birds , like this tanager , have adapted within the same species .
never before in the history of human culture had it been as professionalized , never before as concentrated .
this is what he had to say .
in my mind , the largest red flag warning for humanity that we are in a precarious situation .
in fact , there &apos;s a fence quite upstream of this threshold , beyond which you are in a danger zone .
all you need is a single oncogene .
they are completely different from each other .
i want to show you the rest of this photograph , because this photograph is analogous to what we do to the word &quot; &quot; compassion &quot; &quot; in our culture — we clean it up and we diminish its depths and its grounding in life , which is messy .
he liked to talk about the spiritual geniuses of the ages .
i think it comes when we start to value the gift of a near win .
how many inventors and untold entrepreneurs live out this phenomenon ?
in karaoke bars , there are always people who sing &quot; she &apos;s gone &quot; or &quot; hotel california , &quot; miming the guitar riffs .
the magic question is , &quot; &quot; what for ? &quot; &quot; but art is not for anything .
it doesn &apos;t hit me until years later just how little we had .
and i hold this penny in the palm of my hand , and it &apos;s sticky and rusty , but it feels like i &apos;m holding a fortune .
actually , i was totally freaking out — ( laughter ) — and i was borderline hypothermic , and my friends eventually had to help me out of the water .
and i realized , all this shivering had actually taught me something : in life , there are no shortcuts to joy .
the very first landline telephones , the inventors thought that they would be used for people to listen in to live performances from west end theaters .
what would that do to the resources available to the education system ?
and tata had gotten its start as a communications business when they bought two cables , one across the atlantic and one across the pacific , and proceeded to add pieces onto them , until they had built a belt around the world , which means they will send your bits to the east or the west .
and what surprised me as well was that as much as this is based on the most sophisticated technology , as much as this is an incredibly new thing , the physical process itself has been around for a long time , and the culture is the same .
ad : and here &apos;s what we were able to recover from our silent video captured outside behind that window .
and so here &apos;s the video that we captured .
on the 10th of september last year we turned the machine on for the first time .
this is the one i work on . it &apos;s called the atlas detector — 44 meters wide , 22 meters in diameter .
they &apos;re just like everyone else .
for example : why is apple so innovative ?
could that hole in reality open up and swallow me ?
and we can see them repeating themselves throughout history , just with slight variations to reflect the vocabulary of the day .
i &apos;ve got some of the pieces in my pocket here .
so today we &apos;re going to show you one example of how you can use this .
one big remaining question , of course , is , could we ever confirm the existence of other universes ?
you see , we are all used to gravity being a force that does one thing , pulls objects together .
what would that mean ?
it &apos;s good for your soul .
so a little over a decade ago , two groups of physicists and astronomers set out to measure the rate at which the expansion of space was slowing down , ok .
now it turns out , in the mathematics , you can put it in as a term that &apos;s an energy , but it &apos;s a completely different type of energy from anything we &apos;ve ever seen before .
one was that the city itself wasn &apos;t necessarily too large , but the economy was too small .
so we began our process in september of 2010 .
now most places that i talk to , when i talk about experience , i talk about disney — the world &apos;s premier experience-stager .
the experience capital in the world of conferences .
so , in summary , i &apos;m generating metabolic materials as a counterpoise to victorian technologies , and building architectures from a bottom-up approach .
well , most likely it would . it might be able to grow .
do we also have specialized brain regions for other senses , like hearing ?
patient : nothing . neurologist : nothing ? okay .
this led to me writing &quot; &quot; the vagina monologues , &quot; &quot; which led to me obsessively and incessantly talking about vaginas everywhere i could .
and i am there with the three million in the streets of port-au-prince .
take the lebanese hezbollah , known for its violent confrontation against israel .
now , what do you call a group like hezbollah ?
it had to be run in different languages .
and another story of the cylinder begins .
and we need to think very dispassionately about the comparative advantages of small-scale and large-scale .
it was only 200 years ago that we had the advent of the industrial revolution .
it worked admirably for paris , when the city tore down hundreds of historical buildings to create 85 miles of transportation-friendly boulevards .
and the reality is that you &apos;re looking at two very different networks .
the term &quot; &quot; deep six &quot; &quot; comes to mind : &quot; &quot; if it &apos;s too big or too toxic for a landfill , deep six it ! &quot; &quot; so , i hope that we can also keep some of these &quot; &quot; hope spots &quot; &quot; in the deep sea .
and i knew , right then , at age six , that is an animal that i want to learn more about . so i did .
one of my favorite : it &apos;s 40 below , you &apos;ve got to go to the bathroom , where are you going to go and how are you going to do it ?
that i &apos;m this uber-endurance guy ?
it &apos;s fast , it &apos;s pretty private .
and the secret is she opens every single one .
&quot; be careful , abed , look out . slow down . &quot;
were all of us the results of things done to us , done for us , the infidelity of a parent or spouse , money inherited ?
so that &apos;s the concept here for how we think this life extension ability exists .
these hormones are similar to hormones that we have in our bodies .
uganda &apos;s recurrent expenditure — by recurrent what do i mean ?
we have limited input , because he who pays the piper calls the tune .
both of these machines are capable of automatically identifying a human target and firing on it , the one on the left at a distance of over a kilometer .
but i &apos;m actually not here to talk about fiction .
and it &apos;s not going to be easy .
what i learned in 2001 was that my vote mattered but that my voice and vantage point also mattered .
the children who scored highest on this &quot; &quot; do you know &quot; &quot; scale had the highest self-esteem and a greater sense they could control their lives .
every parent i know , myself included , feels like we &apos;re constantly playing defense .
now look at his response .
you &apos;re helping him discover the garden by just pointing out these snails .
we don &apos;t borrow any energy from history .
we need active system .
we &apos;re losing them .
because the pictures made it feel more real to you .
one day , i was pacing my cell , when an officer came and delivered mail .
i looked at a couple of letters before i looked at the letter that had my son &apos;s squiggly handwriting on it .
( laughter ) so my common sense , my good intentions , were in conflict with my taste buds .
best of all , i &apos;m healthier , i know that i &apos;m going to live longer , and i &apos;ve even lost a little weight .
my dad is white from cornwall , and my mom is black from zimbabwe .
or who we really want to be , or should be ?
it &apos;s got no water .
these craters are weeping during the summer .
( laughter ) finally , oysters can attenuate and agglomerate onto each other and form these amazing natural reef structures .
oyster reefs also covered about a quarter of our harbor and were capable of filtering water in the harbor in a matter of days .
he goes , catches the ball , sprints in , touchdown .
because i believe that we can use augmented reality for something more .
we &apos;ll make a new film about this process .
we have to work together .
i design reading programs for preschoolers .
what i &apos;ve learned is if we put some time into planning our end of life , we have the best chance of maintaining our quality of life .
in fact , with edx , when we were teaching our first course on circuits and electronics around the world , this was happening unbeknownst to us .
with instant feedback , the computer grades exercises .
so how is that being accomplished here ?
it is going to change absolutely everything .
but as we push thresholds in the name of learning and innovation , we must remember that accountability for our environments never goes away .
satellites in high orbits like these could remain there for centuries .
but we want stuff that we &apos;re going to love for years , not just stuff .
so i &apos;m not saying that we all need to live in 420 sq. ft .
i also wanted to paint the highlights and create a mapping on his body in greyscale .
we got a pool . we filled it with milk .
i want to take something rather humble to discuss .
here &apos;s a great little example .
what do you think happened then ?
if you put you put an executive admin. on the team , they get significantly better .
this is their perception of why you shouldn &apos;t mess with uncontacted indians .
and in peru , there &apos;s a very nasty business .
so let &apos;s say that we go to a museum with a tablet , okay ?
well , we also learned that vasari , who was commissioned to remodel the hall of the 500 between 1560 and 1574 by the grand duke cosimo i of the medici family , we have at least two instances when he saved masterpieces specifically by placing a brick wall in front of it and leaving a small air gap .
they texted me back , &quot; &quot; it &apos;s called a syzygy . &quot; &quot; which i knew , because it &apos;s the word that won me the ohio spelling bee in 1976 .
i review gadgets and stuff .
they have similar sound of eyes .
i think this will be a big , big change that we will see during this century .
using the very first telephone , watson was in fact dialed into the heavens .
there was a glitch in their soundtrack .
&quot; i want to give you a hug . &quot;
now he , the guy , takes all of this in , figuring , &quot; honestly , geez , what are my chances ? &quot;
i just wonder , do you think the american government should give edward snowden amnesty ?
who needed , who had to have the information so that they could do the important parts of the job that you needed ?
wk : after i dropped out of school , i went to library , and i read a book that would — &quot; &quot; using energy , &quot; &quot; and i get information about doing the mill .
wk : yeah . the windmill .
it &apos;s a typical downtown street ; it just happens to be self-built .
to tell you about that i have to talk about this fellow here , his name is julius .
volunteer : 3481 . ab : 3481 .
you sir , that &apos;s three .
and the last emotion of pride .
thirty seconds . into the network . make the node .
and can we afford not to ? thank you .
aside from one-person abc mini-bureaus in nairobi , new delhi and mumbai , there are no network news bureaus in all of africa , india or south america — places that are home to more than two billion people .
the first two are the macrobot and decibot .
we have exciting machines that can take us into space — five years &#91; of assembly time &#93; , 2.5 million parts .
it &apos;s basically symptoms .
so , this picture , although it is beautiful , is a 40-gigabyte picture of the whole proteome .
what if instead of fighting our brains , or trying to force ourselves to pay attention , we instead tapped into this natural , reward-based learning process ...
we become this inner scientist where we &apos;re eagerly awaiting that next data point .
but i just want to say that i &apos;ve met girls with knife wounds and cigarette burns , who are literally being treated like ashtrays .
and i asked her if she loved her baby .
because i realized that nature had invented reproduction as a mechanism for life to move forward , as a life force that passes right through us and makes us a link in the evolution of life .
you know , i think there might be some presentations that will go over my head , but the most amazing concepts are the ones that go right under my feet .
another important consequence is goal seeking .
here we see entropica orchestrating new connections on a social network where friends are constantly falling out of touch and successfully keeping the network well connected .
they are women and men who are preparing themselves not for the comfortable predictability of yesterday but also for the realities of today and all of those unknown possibilities of tomorrow .
so what makes a great leader in the 21st century ?
don &apos;t we have the right to know ?
and actually , one of our federal officials said that it was probably heat stress . so ...
will the next big-budget blockbuster movies actually be chick flicks ?
it turns out that women are really driving the social media revolution .
we &apos;re all serving time ; we &apos;re just in different places .
at free america , we &apos;ve done a listening and learning tour .
these epiphytes are mainly dominated by the mosses .
and i use this little image to say this is what happens to mosses .
but actually within the town you start to create these economic cycles much more effectively .
but we also live in a world with very real constraints and demands .
( laughter ) so this is one . ( laughter )
and there was a little — an interesting theory about abstraction .
so mayors are pragmatists and problem-solvers .
mayors are pragmatists , they &apos;re problem-solvers .
if obesity is nothing more than a proxy for metabolic illness , what good does it do us to punish those with the proxy ?
now failure to produce enough insulin is incompatible with life .
so this interdependent world which has been pretty good to most of us — which is why we &apos;re all here in northern california doing what we do for a living , enjoying this evening — is profoundly unequal .
and then there are six different categories of things we can do to change the trajectory .
it &apos;s an arabic-medium school .
she had to translate it into english at her grammar school .
and if i make the flap from the middle , it uses a full circle .
and they &apos;re very simple , easy to understand .
and this is a game where individuals can actually take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how the protein is going to fold .
you see , even though aluminum is 8.3 percent of the earth by mass , it doesn &apos;t come as a pure metal .
so keith jarrett left .
now , this idea of marginal gains will eventually get you a good jet engine .
that &apos;s where other forms of research need to kick in , and that &apos;s also why pisa doesn &apos;t venture into telling countries what they should be doing .
the answer is , students in korea learn in large classes .
so here you see , this is a health facility in northern afghanistan , and every morning it looks like this all over .
so , from 2008 up until today , a substantial change and step forward has been taking place .
this is an 8,000-square-foot installation composed of many different creatures , some hanging from the ceiling and some resting on the floor .
i &apos;d like to share with you how ordinary things can become something magical and wondrous .
it is too expensive for humanity .
and also , all micrornas are very similar to each other , with just tiny differences .
a city of the future is a city that can never let anyone out of this great party , which are cities .
let &apos;s think that cities are made of people , lots of people together .
so as i look around this room at people who either have achieved , or are on their way to achieving , remarkable levels of success , i would offer this reminder : don &apos;t wait .
not every day is going to offer us a chance to save somebody &apos;s life , but every day offers us an opportunity to affect one .
children are amazingly adaptable .
a six-month stalemate was broken by the 442nd in 32 minutes .
what a journey that would have been .
i also played poker every weekend .
anyone can lead . anyone can follow .
tc : so we wanted to look at this from a totally different angle .
it &apos;s far beyond what we currently have .
seconds after this video was taken , people in beijing , people in sydney , people in amsterdam , people in washington d.c. were watching this .
the third year , the total was up to around 40 .
this is what jesus asked of us .
so the way we fix this problem is actually relatively easy , in principle : you give everybody their own keys , and then you make sure the server doesn &apos;t actually have the keys .
so if we want to have privacy online , the only way we can succeed is if we get the whole world on board , and this is only possible if we bring down the barrier to entry .
so the orthopedic center was closed because physical rehabilitation was not considered a priority .
he was telling me , &quot; &quot; patients are coming . &quot; &quot; we knew that many more patients could not come , prevented by the fighting .
mbi found 83 percent .
so how does this work ?
thank you very much .
of course we don &apos;t .
we are now very comfortable imagining unimaginable technological achievement .
it &apos;s time for us to dream in multiple dimensions simultaneously , and somewhere that transcends all of the wondrous things we can and will and must do lies the domain of all the unbelievable things we could be .
and that &apos;s preposterous .
and they passed through the detector .
the only problem with this bill is it &apos;s not really worth very much .
so the next time somebody as cute as this shows up on your doorstep , and sometimes this creature &apos;s called chrysler and sometimes ford and sometimes ... whatever you want — you &apos;ve just got to say no .
you ’ re just too blind to see it now .
my mum wanted to , couldn ’ t afford it .
all peoples are simply cultural options , different visions of life itself .
indeed , if you took all of the genius that allowed us to put a man on the moon and applied it to an understanding of the ocean , what you would get is polynesia .
and we persisted , and we got 450 guys growing mustaches , and together we raised 54,000 dollars , and we donated every cent of that to the prostate cancer foundation of australia , and that represented at the time the single biggest donation they &apos;d ever received .
our ribbon is a hairy ribbon . ( laughter ) our ambassadors are the mo bros and the mo sistas , and i think that &apos;s been fundamental to our success .
right now is the most exciting time to see new indian art .
jitish kallat successfully practices across photography , sculpture , painting and installation .
it was just lying on the surface .
( audio ) nr : it &apos;s not a whole lot . it fits in a small ziploc bag .
there &apos;s been about a decade of research about what people are calling the &quot; &quot; boy crisis . &quot; &quot; now the boy crisis is this idea that very young boys , for whatever reason , are doing worse in school than very young girls , and people have theories about that .
they were basically asked by one of their clients who was going to buy houses in that neighborhood in the future .
and i &apos;m insecure because i have to think about what i look like every day .
and of course , barring surgery , or the fake tan that i got two days ago for work , there &apos;s very little that we can do to transform how we look , and how we look , though it is superficial and immutable , has a huge impact on our lives .
here &apos;s what that looks like .
she wouldn &apos;t take a bottle .
occasionally on a really important ship , they &apos;d get a member of the royal family to come , duke of edinburgh , princess anne or somebody .
the shipyard was noisy , dangerous , highly toxic , with an appalling health and safety record .
there weren &apos;t many of them available , and they weren &apos;t quite as easy to find as the foreign books .
what if my roommate knew about contemporary nigerian music , talented people singing in english and pidgin , and igbo and yoruba and ijo , mixing influences from jay-z to fela to bob marley to their grandfathers .
he said , &quot; &quot; i &apos;m so proud of you . &quot; &quot; and i have to tell you , it was energizing .
and i mention that because i think identity is really important .
and we have to move to a model of an and / and model which is how do we make money and do good ?
they have to begin to play their role in terms of serving the communities which actually sustain them .
now , that &apos;s been the promise of the self-driving car , the autonomous vehicle , and it &apos;s been the dream since at least 1939 , when general motors showcased this idea at their futurama booth at the world &apos;s fair .
they are things that they have simply learned to do .
now , over the years , i &apos;ve collected many hundreds of drawings of these toasts , and some of them are very good , because they really illustrate the toast-making process quite clearly .
and these visual frames of reference can grow to several hundreds or even thousands of nodes .
and it &apos;s very important to have political reforms , to have widely shared benefits of economic growth .
and you need a strong government to do that , because you cannot respect private property rights .
and what they &apos;ve realized is that using violence in the situations they operate in is not only less humane , but it &apos;s less effective than using methods that connect people with people , that rebuild .
because at the beginning i was so outraged at the dangers they were exposing us to that i just wanted to argue and blame and make them wrong .
if we simply brought that ratio down to 15,000 to one , we would be meeting those aid targets that were agreed at the rio summit 20 years ago that the summit that ended last week made no further progress on .
if you look at the official statistics , they typically indicate a little bit above 30 percent .
when india was growing at about three , 3.5 percent and the population was growing at two percent , its per capita income was doubling every 45 years .
this is one of the factors which needs to be resolved .
education — the synthesis of wisdom and knowledge — is the means to strive for a more perfect , more aware , more noble and more just society .
a few years ago , historian arnold toynbee said that the world was suffering a huge spiritual crisis .
you will say , &quot; &quot; okay , this is nice — a slide created in 10 minutes . &quot; &quot; but not only that .
you don &apos;t want to get close to gamma rays , it could be dangerous .
there &apos;s a street in the air on the 25th level , a community street .
this is beijing then , not a single high rise building in beijing or shanghai .
that makes 12 of them .
and now she was going to watch electricity do that work .
the most obvious implications are for the war on drugs .
it won &apos;t be your twitter followers who come to sit with you .
a spectrogram is a graphic illustration of sound with time from left to right across the page — 15 seconds in this case is represented — and frequency from the bottom of the page to the top , lowest to highest .
this is after selective logging .
you know . what about safety ?
they thought , &quot; &quot; who would use it if you didn &apos;t ? &quot; &quot; and so , in fact , he actually set about doing a variety of things .
and actually , over these 150 years , there has been a very clear class system that also has emerged .
100 percent are using text .
i do not believe that meditation and prayer will change this world .
it is about action .
eighty percent of them are living in low-income countries such as kenya , and the absolute majority do not need to be blind .
we &apos;ve got many trials going on in the community and in schools , and through the lessons that we &apos;ve learned in the field , we &apos;ve realized it &apos;s extremely important to share the data in non-medical jargon so that people understand what we &apos;re examining and what that means to them .
the first issue : imagine a potential enemy announcing they &apos;re building a cyberwar unit , but only for their country &apos;s defense .
however , this episode reveals the growing anxiety in the western world regarding these emerging cyber weapons .
for others , the present is irrelevant .
any time perspective in excess has more negatives than positives .
( applause ) chris anderson : so , first of all , i wish i had your eloquence , truly , in any language . ( applause )
these are the trees .
and the local financing is not part of the ecosystem for supporting hardware projects .
and we worked together first with building and growing ushahidi .
the ideal savanna landscape is one of the clearest examples where human beings everywhere find beauty in similar visual experience .
is beauty in the eye of the beholder ?
once they threaten your advertisers , market forces are actually , you know , destroyed , and the advertisers do not want to come — no matter how much does it make sense for them — do not want to come and advertise .
forget about handouts ; 20,000 dollars do not help anybody .
but what is equally remarkable is socioeconomic rights in africa have not moved forward very fast even since the age of colonialism .
but we did get an agreement on climate change .
so they copy each other .
and this is one of those images .
he was constantly depressed .
the next day i started with the medications and the therapy .
and i see the power of music . i see the power of music
and after a few months i was writing songs .
it wasn &apos;t organized in the way we often think of it .
and i say , &apos; look at me . you are not dead .
our first school was on a rooftop of a building inside the slums , a second story building , the only second story building inside the slums .
and i wouldn &apos;t want to go to bangalore . let me stay here .
( laughter ) those cells turn themselves over once every eight years .
but they influence each other in profound and measurable ways .
so the conclusion with the families — and this is important , not our conclusion — with the families , was that we had a problem .
what other problems do you have and you want us to take care of now that the city will have to be rethought from scratch ?
can i see a show of hands of anyone here who didn &apos;t make a mistake or do something they regretted at 22 ?
i know , right ?
labels like &quot; &quot; regulars &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; honors &quot; &quot; resonate .
i march down hallways cleaned up after me every day by regular janitors , but i never have the decency to honor their names .
i passed them really well , but i still came out of school thinking that that stuff came out of the ground .
and we intercut it with , &quot; &quot; we are the premier science university in the world , &quot; &quot; because of british-like hubris .
how many ramanujans are there in india today toiling in the fields , barely able to feed themselves , when they could be feeding the world ?
it costs about the same to produce a new drug whether that drug treats 1,000 people , 100,000 people , or a million people .
&quot; &quot; in the theory with which we have to deal , absolute ignorance is the artificer ; so that we may enunciate as the fundamental principle of the whole system , that , in order to make a perfect and beautiful machine , it is not requisite to know how to make it .
so babies have to attract our affection and our nurturing , and they do .
the folks at aerovironment tried 300 or more different wing designs , 12 different forms of the avionics .
experiments suggest that lightning could be the next gps .
( video ) characters : thank you . thank you . thank you . thank you . thank you .
i spent a lot of time in the bathroom .
apparently it can .
and there &apos;s about three hackerspaces or more in detroit .
sticking wires into the brain is obviously rather crude .
this is the first ever such experiment , sort of the optical equivalent of galvani &apos;s .
but we were able to do it , we got all the kits made , thanks a lot to techshop , which was a big help to us , and we shipped these kits all over the world just before christmas of last year , so it was just a few months ago .
( aquatic noises ) so this video was taken at aquarius undersea laboratory four miles off the coast of key largo , about 60 feet below the surface .
last april , i went back to a very strange — what i called a deranged high school reunion .
why aren &apos;t you home with luca ? &quot; &quot; and i said , &quot; &quot; well , i have to see . &quot; &quot; it was 2004 which was the beginning of the incredibly bloody time in iraq , &quot; &quot; i have to see , i have to see what is happening here .
so i went to church as often as i could .
he told me that he didn &apos;t give himself a salary , because despite success , the program struggled for resources .
and the world didn &apos;t end .
in my own little discipline of human geography , a cartographer called waldo tobler was drawing new maps of the planet , and these maps have now spread , and i &apos;m going to show you one of them now .
in particular , it then becomes possible for a competitor in one business to use their position in one step of the value chain in order to penetrate or attack or disintermediate the competitor in another .
it becomes above all clinical .
thank you . ( applause ) thank you . thank you . ( applause ) thank you . ( applause )
we &apos;ve got laws that fundamentally treat creative works as property , plus massive rewards or settlements in infringement cases , plus huge legal fees to protect yourself in court , plus cognitive biases against perceived loss .
because strangers are part of a world of really rigid boundaries .
why not strangers ?
because what happens is , bread begins as wheat or any other grain .
we &apos;ll start a little piece here , and i &apos;m going to take a little piece here — i think i &apos;d better taste it myself before you have it at lunch .
but i also , in looking at more powerful technologies and nanotechnology and genetic engineering and other new emerging kind of digital technologies , became very concerned about the potential for abuse .
and so we begin to see , and we &apos;ve seen business plans already , where the kind of things lisa randall &apos;s talking about are in there .
we just had to give them the tools and place to survey for ebola .
they show their spirit .
now , there &apos;s one piece of good news i have that may save the world . okay .
are you on the edges of your seats here ?
one of the other big guys in the industry is an italian company called hacking team .
&#91; &quot; &quot; windows , os x , ios , android , blackberry , symbian , linux &quot; &quot; &#93; you have to overcome encryption and capture relevant data .
and that was just luck .
we didn &apos;t have a way of preparing people .
we imagine black people living and thriving .
i &apos;ve been learning about how to trust your team .
( applause )
i &apos;m working at a gas station on the outskirts of santa barbara , california .
and we sat down , we did the physics of eggbeaters and self-aligning tubes and all the rest of that kind of thing , sent it off to a journal .
now , the next question that you would like to ask is : what would you like to measure ? what would you like to analyze ?
so my research focuses on ways to make bees healthier .
overwintering success is hard , and that &apos;s when most of the colonies are lost , and we found that in the cities , bees are surviving better than they are in the country .
if it &apos;s elliptical , you can make an astigmatic lens .
this doesn &apos;t mean we should ignore software , or information , or computation . &quot; &quot; and that &apos;s in fact probably what i &apos;m going to try and tell you about .
in canada , we &apos;re now looking at one in 10 canadian children with asthma .
and many of these workers have life expectancies of only 50 .
that &apos;s what it looks like looking down it .
this is all forest service land . if you go up on top of those cliffs , that &apos;s some of the long now land in those trees .
but it didn &apos;t even slow down the animal .
it has a hundred to a thousand split ends , and that &apos;s the secret , because it allows intimate contact .
my son , davey , in the hotel two nights ago .
my archive : 175 films , my 16-millimeter negative , all my books , my dad &apos;s books , my photographs .
these are massive machines .
so it &apos;s a wiki project .
i want you now to imagine a wearable robot that gives you superhuman abilities , or another one that takes wheelchair users up standing and walking again .
these are nothing else than something that you put on in the morning , and it will give you extra strength , and it will further enhance your speed , and it will help you , for instance , to manage your balance .
sounded very ominous when he took me nearby to the lake , conveniently called lake lyndon baines johnson .
and because he was so sad and so vulnerable , he opened up to me in ways he never would have had i known him at the height of his power — sharing his fears , his sorrows and his worries .
he stood on moral ground and refused to pay bribes .
or we can take the much more difficult path of transformation , transcendence , compassion and love , but also accountability and justice .
the second thing that really attracted me were his bright red cheeks .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;ll be content together . &quot; &quot; he never used my nickname again .
you can take it home with you , unlike the theme building , which will stay where it is forever .
i have no idea . i don &apos;t know what that thing is .
it &apos;s one tragedy compounding another .
okay . open your eyes .
and it &apos;s a very interesting thing , but nevertheless easy to think that still it represents some sort of decline .
that &apos;s how much of a latterly thing writing is .
what if there are truths about justice , and you could just look around in this world and see which things participated , partook of that form of justice ?
he thought ethics was a matter of making decisions in the here-and-now using our best judgment to find the right path .
it thought of itself as being disconnected from the internet , but it was possible for somebody to smuggle a usb drive in there , or something like that , and software got in there that causes the centrifuges , in that case , to actually destroy themselves .
so of course , the fastest way to get a message anywhere was to send it to this guy , who would send it back in time and get it there super early , so every message in the internet started getting switched through this one node , and of course that clogged everything up .
socrates died in prison , his philosophy intact .
tony learns about the ontologically promiscuous , the epistemologically anxious , the ethically dubious , the metaphysically ridiculous .
and i hope that a few of you at least can help us make that happen .
and it spread because of the power of an idea — so the very , very simple idea about turning education on its head and putting the things which were marginal , things like working in teams , doing practical projects , and putting them right at the heart of learning , rather than on the edges .
we &apos;ve had hbo here this morning . i &apos;m wondering if mark burnett is anywhere in the audience , i &apos;d like to suggest a reality tv show called &quot; &quot; pre-vivor . &quot; &quot; if you develop a disease , you &apos;re off the island .
we also refer to subclinical conditions .
we spent two and a half years conducting research ; we spent another year and a half in advance development .
it can &apos;t just be a giant sexist conspiracy .
the room is a theatre . it changes colors .
and when the printing press was invented what they found was they could print indulgences , which was the equivalent of printing money .
so it was a way to script and design the building , but of course , also to communicate its experiences .
we paid a lot of attention to sustainability .
as a kid , i was obsessed with space .
well , i was obsessed with nuclear science too , to a point , but before that i was obsessed with space , and i was really excited about , you know , being an astronaut and designing rockets , which was something that was always exciting to me .
thankfully , the flux , in other words , the flow of emissions from the ocean to the atmosphere and vice versa , is more or less balanced .
a picture that you &apos;re familiar with — the amazon rainforests .
i have no question that the physics , the engineering to get us down to the point where all of us can afford orbital space flight is around the corner .
this is what happens when you put up a prize , when you announce it and teams start to begin doing trials .
and it exists .
now that , if your spine is not held in a good position , will help bend your spine the wrong way , and so on .
&quot; &quot; i need to be in some backwoods redneck town so that i can feel beautiful . &quot; &quot; &quot; i feel invisible to you . &quot;
you can sift through this data and see what people have submitted .
in a world where it is just about as easy to generate an object as it is to print a document , we have amazing new possibilities .
it &apos;s a world that erik brynjolfsson and i are calling &quot; the new machine age . &quot;
against the background of rising inequality , marketizing every aspect of life leads to a condition where those who are affluent and those who are of modest means increasingly live separate lives .
for two reasons , i think .
i don &apos;t have the results yet .
but we might be able to learn something from ants about treating cancer .
it &apos;s the knockout .
we partnered with a leading medical research institution here in boston .
the school where he graduated from with his master &apos;s had just offered him a teaching appointment , which meant not only a salary , but benefits for the first time in ages .
( applause )
wherever we are , any time of night or day , our bosses , junk-mailers , our parents can get to us .
i almost never have to look at the time , and every morning when i wake up , really the day stretches in front of me like an open meadow .
number two , there &apos;s power in promiscuous thinking .
( applause )
and i &apos;d heard this before as well .
i &apos;d called this the &quot; &quot; everything &quot; &quot; theory , or eoe : everything on earth .
each time i get a wall in new york , i use his photos to continue spreading the project .
one hundred thousand posters have been printed this year .
it &apos;s a pharmaceutical product .
take copenhagen last year — complete failure of governments to do the right thing in the face of an international challenge .
and it says , &quot; &quot; ich habe genug , &quot; &quot; which is a bach cantata , which i once thought meant &quot; &quot; i &apos;ve had it , i can &apos;t take it anymore , give me a break , &quot; &quot; but i was wrong .
&quot; and decided his top people had to be extinctified . &quot;
and i was able to attract really , really good people , people who share my passion for science and service to society , not science and service for career building .
we start here with our workhorse one watt-hour cell .
( laughter ) this is olympus mons .
here &apos;s hellas basin , a very very different place , geologically .
all we have to do is to get our egos out of the way , get our egotism out of the way .
but don &apos;t ignore what you &apos;ve asked them to do .
that &apos;s why we put the display up high , out of your line of sight , so it wouldn &apos;t be where you &apos;re looking and it wouldn &apos;t be where you &apos;re making eye contact with people .
man 6 : holy &#91; beep &#93; ! that is awesome .
and i think we make a fundamental mistake — we make an assumption , that we think that , if people need something , we don &apos;t have to make them want that .
melinda french gates : it feels pretty good , right ?
and i &apos;m certainly looking forward with immense excitement to it being turned on .
and , as of today , it &apos;s made of these things .
you know ? you go to the theater , you &apos;re just so excited to see anything .
we put it in eddie &apos;s sleeve , and so the hand that you see — i &apos;ll show you again , that &apos;s not eddie &apos;s hand , that &apos;s tom &apos;s .
and i &apos;m going to use it to give you my take on the stuff of life .
now my own speciality is combining digital technology and magic .
the white mayor visited mr. teszler and said , &quot; mr. teszler , i trust you ’ re going to be hiring a lot of white workers . &quot;
and there , mr. teszler began all over again and once again achieved immense success , especially after he invented the process for manufacturing a new fabric called double-knit .
david .
we &apos;re losing our sites and the stories , and basically we &apos;re losing a piece — and a significant piece — of our collective memory .
just as the police in ferguson possess high-tech military weapons and equipment , so too do police departments across the united states possess high-tech surveillance gear .
( applause ) .
he was beaten up when he refused to confess that he threw stones , and as a result , had internal injuries that caused his death soon after he was released from prison .
it means &quot; &quot; upside-down . &quot; &quot; you cook it with rice and chicken , and you flip it upside-down .
because the ink was written in iron .
and when it takes its place , it sheds electromagnetic radiation .
i thought , &quot; &quot; oh , if there &apos;s no pictures , then there &apos;ll be no record . we need a record . &quot; &quot; and i thought , &quot; &quot; i &apos;m gonna make that record .
the novelist richard ford speaks about a childhood challenge that continues to be something he wrestles with today . he &apos;s severely dyslexic .
we built our first prototype drones in switzerland .
now these models are not just visually appealing , but they are also geometrically accurate , which means researchers can now measure the distance between trees , calculate surface area , the volume of vegetation , and so on , all of which are important information for monitoring the health of these forests .
from their little hatching size of their egg , into their little larval stage till they reach adulthood , they put on 600 million times an increase in weight .
and it &apos;s pictured right here , that little tag up there .
( laughter ) ( applause ) now you might find copyright math strange , but that &apos;s because it &apos;s a field that &apos;s best left to experts .
( laughter ) now this is a key number from the copyright mathematicians &apos; toolkit .
you know , there &apos;s two ways you can make a product .
i &apos;ve been interested in food for a long time .
they &apos;re open , these festivals , because , like in minto , they understand that the dialogue between the local and the global is essential .
in a series of shows that includes &quot; &quot; 100 percent vancouver , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 100 percent berlin , &quot; &quot; rimini protokoll makes shows that actually reflect society .
when i first met celine , a little over a year ago , she had gone for 18 months without any antiretroviral therapy , and she was very ill .
now during the clinical trial , she &apos;d been given all her antiretroviral drugs free of charge , and her transportation costs had been covered by the research funds .
maybe a few lung diseases here and there , but , you know , that &apos;s not such a big deal .
( laughter ) some of us might think that would be a good thing .
this chart takes four different factors and says how much do they explain teaching quality .
1990 , you &apos;ve gotten most of the northern areas .
just the pursuit of interest , wherever it lies , across all the disciplines that are represented here .
so , i &apos;m just going to grab a chair here .
we could eliminate sugar across the board for all confectionary products and sodas , and we can replace it with all-natural fresh fruit .
so yeah , we &apos;re transforming things into something that you have absolutely no reference for .
( applause ) bc : i &apos;m not sure if other poems will be animated .
but i like to pretend that it comes with ease .
you can see here , it begins to roll , and the boat has moved to the other side , and the man is standing there .
i first went to antarctica almost 10 years ago , where i saw my first icebergs .
the whole immune system swarms into the lungs .
the pandemic circulated three times in 18 months in the absence of commercial air travel .
with , you know , of course , there &apos;s the gravity brain .
this is a home made entirely out of fruit roll-ups .
we &apos;re also starting ancillary health-care technology training programs — training people in echocardiography , cardiac ultrasound , those kinds of things . now , with that kind of training , it gives people motivation .
in a look at the map of the u.s. — the graph here , 10 million people here , 10 million here .
there are other pleasures , but this is dominant .
everybody talks about happiness these days .
einstein , would you like to ride in burt &apos;s spaceship ?
e : &#91; bobbing head &#93; ( laughter ) sw : let &apos;s get down for everybody . come on now .
so i &apos;m going to start another beat for you , like this .
it is possible , and you can do it very simply using this machine . it &apos;s really fantastic . check it out .
that the force that causes the apple to fall to the ground is the same force that causes the planets and the moon to move around , and so on ? everybody knows that . it &apos;s a property of gravitation .
dc miller . what about that ? &quot; &quot; and he would say , &quot; &quot; aw , that &apos;ll go away . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) now , why does stuff like that work ? that &apos;s the question .
in fact , if you think about the deforestation in the amazon in 2013 , that was over half a million hectares , which means that every minute , an area the size of two soccer fields is being cut in the amazon last year , just last year .
what we see here , those brown trees , these are really dead trees .
by just being there , you may just be the turning point that they need .
my grandfather committed suicide by poisoning .
yes , you can say i can &apos;t be an archeologist .
i count the steps and the lampposts and all those things that visually impaired people have a tendency to have a lot of meetings with .
and this is our hope , that &apos;s there &apos;s poetry inside of each of our stories .
voice 8 : i was driving to work at 5 : 45 local time in the morning .
look for it . have you noticed it ?
i &apos;m going to ask that we play it at the speed i read it .
i must admit , i used to be one of them .
and most folks don &apos;t even know they exist .
special olympics is transforming their lives off the field .
what do you think of when you see someone like me ?
this trailer housed two turntables , mixer , wet bar , fridge , integrated sound system .
the trailers themselves are actually hand-built .
( laughter ) i wanted it to be less of a mechanical structure giving me light , and more of a helpful , kind of quiet apprentice that &apos;s always there when you need it and doesn &apos;t really interfere .
it sometimes acts without knowing everything it has to know .
and remember , paths crossed in 1984 , and more and more women were dying of cardiovascular disease .
this was the only modality that can see the inner lining of the heart .
it looks like i &apos;ve paused the program .
anyway , while we &apos;re here , again , if you want to visit anything , all you need to do is double-click .
when it comes time to sheetrock , if you use ecorock it &apos;s about a quarter of the embodied energy of standard sheetrock .
now , the average house has about 300 megawatt hours of embodied energy in it ; this is the energy it takes to make it — millions and millions of paper towels .
they feel spiritual because it &apos;s a heart opening , right ?
and most of them are a good deal younger than me , too .
it was the suggested syllabus for dealing with the applied arts and science at cambridge university in 1829 .
and it turns out that , in fact , technologies don &apos;t die .
you could never get a permit to dump this in the ocean , and it &apos;s coming out all from it .
and then we had some hint that these things existed all along the axis of it , because if you &apos;ve got volcanism , water &apos;s going to get down from the sea into cracks in the sea floor , come in contact with magma , and come shooting out hot .
this here is an equal bracket for the same purpose .
so for instance , we are asking ourselves , how can we create more light ?
we are defined by the secrets we keep and by the secrets we share .
now you can give me the marker back .
you stop by a wall , and start painting on that wall .
( applause ) ca : are you going to come back to india with some of this , at some point ?
they &apos;d collected information with photos . they &apos;d manually build each building .
hollywood would spend millions of dollars to do a small urban corridor for a movie because they &apos;d have to do it manually .
talk about a picture of compassion .
in my tradition , there is a gift that we have made to other traditions — to everybody around the world who knows the story of the &quot; &quot; good samaritan . &quot; &quot; many people think of it primarily in terms of charity , random acts of kindness .
thank you . ( applause ) thank you very much . thank you . thank you . ( applause )
what &apos;s wrong with this picture ?
and then when you say children , they will pretty quickly agree with you .
so think of it this way : think of it as inoculating children against ignorance .
in 1987 i heard of a story about a boy that fell through ice and was trapped under a river .
and then i learned how to purge .
( applause ) now i know what some of you are thinking .
to tell you what i mean , consider this trend in egypt .
i &apos;ve got the opportunity now to show you what i &apos;m going to be doing in the future .
( music ) i travel beyond the surface and show something for what it &apos;s worth , for what it &apos;s really made of , how it really works .
but here is the answer of the mean of the patients that actually decided to take lithium .
we did this for als . we can do this for depression , parkinson &apos;s disease , hiv .
so let &apos;s make beautiful , functional , affordable , sustainable products .
so why not make our energy out of the sun and the wind ?
we can address shared value at multiple levels .
other institutions can utilize them to do important work , but only business can create them .
a second , of course , is that , for some people , these become truly disabling , and it &apos;s about four to five percent , perhaps one in 20 .
actually , i work for you . you pay my salary .
but at the time we had to throw in the towel .
and it worked . and it gave the studio great relief .
this is not that they took me — the work didn &apos;t take me — i made the things particularly because i wanted to use them to see the world .
here i am now , if this is the end ? thank you .
this institution is government-backed and it has been the case for the past three decades .
now visual expression is just one form of culture integration .
this may shock you , but we &apos;re literally reading this person &apos;s brain in real time .
now imagine that you will soon be able to look inside your brain and select brain areas to do that same thing .
in fact , we found some pictures that are worth 500 billion words .
we said , well instead of releasing the full text , we &apos;re going to release statistics about the books .
( applause )
it had happened to him , as to them .
these birds make a living by diving into the water .
they can handle a hurricane that comes and goes .
the way to really remember what i saw was to record it as i actually saw it .
i was on a three-month road trip this summer .
you &apos;re going to sit in front of your computer .
and in order to get these kinds of computations started right , you need some kind of input , a kind of seed .
no he doesn &apos;t really mean him . he means mozart , which is — ( laughter ) — like a third seat from the center . ( laughter )
that &apos;s what he does .
in fact , there are two other women who were convicted on the basis of the evidence of this pediatrician , who have subsequently been released on appeal .
and if we can get in at the bottom and understand the genetics , we &apos;ll have a window on the way the disease works , and a whole new way about thinking about disease therapies and preventative treatment and so on .
yet i still hadn &apos;t saved a single life .
you could regain this time .
he needs just a piece of paper where he can put down little marks , and as he does that , he can imagine sounds that had not existed before in that particular combination .
these are the remains of civilizations and they are the places that people went to experience life in a more concentrated , more ordered form .
and then finally , it controls also the secretion of this molecular machinery , which actually digests the food we cook .
the gut is actually the largest immune system , defending your body .
and i think fairly soon , you will see patients being treated with their own fat-derived , or adipose-derived , stem cells .
and we do ok . insulin &apos;s a pretty good therapy .
that distance is really important because it tells us how much light the planet receives overall .
while it &apos;s kepler the telescope , the instrument that stares , it &apos;s we , life , who are searching .
when americans go to college and marry each other , they have very low divorce rates .
how many of you can see all four ?
let go of trying to change it or even wanting it to be different .
we developed a routine .
i have looked at the best and i &apos;ve looked at some of the worst .
we know why kids don &apos;t learn .
thank you . ( applause )
and there &apos;s very illegal hustles , which you smuggle in , you get smuggled in , drugs , pornography , cell phones , and just as in the outer world , there &apos;s a risk-reward tradeoff , so the riskier the enterprise , the more profitable it can potentially be .
the aurochs is the ancestor of all domestic cattle , and so basically its genome is alive , it &apos;s just unevenly distributed .
ben novak was the youngest scientist at the meeting .
but i got a little bad news for you folks . i got some bad news .
can you imagine , every human being is carrying that equipment , even paris hilton ? ( laughter ) go figure .
everybody else raised their prices to the gatherers of brazil nuts because we would buy it otherwise .
so , we went through our 15 commodities .
one answer would be : because the kinetic energy of the water molecules is high and they bounce against things rapidly — that &apos;s a kind of physical science argument .
all of you know about the topic that i &apos;m supposed to talk about .
i thought i knew who you were , who we were as a couple , who i was .
ironically , we used to turn to adultery — that was the space where we sought pure love .
in many african countries the modern sector is lost .
it also means that he will be able to generate wealth .
again , chiming with your view that china has a militarized regime ready to , you know , mobilize its enormous forces .
i was curious about this , so it led me to the work of a danish physicist called tor norretranders , and he converted the bandwidth of the senses into computer terms .
to which i have to say , here &apos;s the thing with the singing cats . that always happens .
sorry for the spoiler alert , but no world peace . not yet .
and we &apos;re working on another transformation , and that is for the existing hirshhorn museum that &apos;s sited on the most revered public space in america , the national mall .
it &apos;s hoisted .
that is , if we don &apos;t take action and do something , these plains will be completely devoid of big cats , and then , in turn , everything else will disappear .
that is the situation we &apos;re in — the last lions .
it took about a year for me to learn this , but it &apos;s really been worth it .
now you can try to change the temperature in your house by opening a window in the winter , but that &apos;s not going to change the setting on the thermostat , which will respond by kicking on the furnace to warm the place back up .
that actually it doesn &apos;t work , or even worse , harms people .
they are our body &apos;s own repair kits , and they &apos;re pluripotent , which means they can morph into all of the cells in our bodies .
so imagine a syrian woman .
but in practice , they get stuck in almost indefinite limbo .
it &apos;s a living organism , cut the slice off , stuck it in a vase of water , it was all right for another two weeks after this .
any dot above that line , and you &apos;ll quickly notice that that includes most countries in the world , represents unnecessary surplus , and is likely to reflect levels of waste in each country .
now , of course , that idea has brought us all of the computer technology we have today and so on .
people like leibniz had wondered about that too 300 years earlier .
proteins are coming in now that basically pinch off this vesicle , making it separate from the rest of the membrane , and now clathrin is basically done with its job , and so proteins are coming in now — we &apos;ve covered them yellow and orange — that are responsible for taking apart this clathrin cage .
take a look at this drawing .
they have a series of traps , of snares that they &apos;ve set up to catch wild pigs , snakes , monkeys , rodents — anything they can , really .
and this was somebody who had incredible potential to spread aspects of our message , whether it be with regards to wildlife conservation or health prevention .
i built a web interface for viewing &quot; &quot; the whale hunt &quot; &quot; that attempts to do just this .
and then in moments of high adrenaline , like when something exciting was happening , i would up that photographic frequency to as many as 37 photographs in five minutes .
forty-eight governors competed , convincing 48 state legislatures to essentially raise standards for high schoolers so that they all take a college prep curriculum .
i went from high school to factory .
and now , our global workforce crisis becomes very personal .
if you look at the employees aged 21 to 30 , this number is even higher .
and the lighting that we use these days looks something like this .
so what you &apos;re going to see now , after this , is a completely photo-real digital face .
now we &apos;ve got you warmed up .
a famous study surveyed people from &#91; 37 &#93; different cultures across the globe , from americans to zulus , on what they look for in a partner .
you &apos;ve probably seen signs like this that tell you that the shrubbery and the highway median and the local golf course is being watered with water that used to be in a sewage treatment plant .
well , in california , we already recycle about 40 billion gallons a year of wastewater through the two-stage advanced treatment process i was telling you about .
and there &apos;s some great ideas already in our patch .
how can we give them some more experience ?
in africa we say , &quot; &quot; god gave the white man a watch and gave the black man time . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) i think , how is it possible for a man with so much time to tell his story in 18 minutes ?
we knew conservation would fail if it doesn &apos;t work to improve the lives of the local communities .
and that &apos;s basically deflation — 50 percent deflation .
so let me just end with a couple of scenarios .
that &apos;s from real data .
( applause ) ca : we need someone for .
and they don &apos;t know that they are not supposed to like computers .
it started as a means of self-expression .
so these are the three arguments that i &apos;m going to give you quickly today .
well , in america , that living in cities , for many of them , they &apos;re living in cities still where they &apos;re dependent on that automobile .
on the ground , it &apos;s powered electrically .
and then you have three — you still have the triple redundancy .
you can &apos;t really see it in this map , but this is the map that becomes the central focus in the second half of my book .
he eventually enlisted the help of this amazing other figure , who &apos;s kind of the other protagonist of the book — this guy , henry whitehead , who was a local minister , who was not at all a man of science , but was incredibly socially connected ; he knew everybody in the neighborhood .
and not even like a tech company , but more like the internet itself .
that &apos;s because government is like a vast ocean and politics is the six-inch layer on top .
and then through a series of steps , he &apos;d move them and they &apos;d be standing in the doorway with the door open and they &apos;d be looking in there .
and i had a major breakthrough when i met the psychologist albert bandura .
these are deep sea sponges , meter scale .
there are new species .
just this morning , we announced the open-source fundamental technologies you just saw in the video .
nick : oh — well , my paper just got accepted .
those organisms that paired with fungi were rewarded , because fungi do not need light .
then we tried extracts , and lo and behold , we can steer insects to different directions .
( applause ) thank you . ( applause )
&quot; &quot; i found these stamps as a child , and i have been waiting all my life to have someone to send them to .
we &apos;ve been giving littlebits to kids and seeing them play with them .
lego has essentially taken the concrete block , the building block of the world , and made it into the building block of our imagination .
i &apos;m going to talk about your mindset .
and they reduced child mortality , with an amazing 4.7 percent per year . they beat sweden .
ue : parachute . we have to open a parachute just seconds before , i would say , impact .
you need to have the best possible equipment .
those of us who remember the newspaper reports that came out of romania after the 1989 revolution will recall the horrors of the conditions in some of those institutions .
thank you . ( applause ) ( applause )
are we worth the cost ?
something that five years ago would have seemed impossible we can now do efficiently and free of corruption .
where is udo from ?
i call these the three &quot; &quot; r ’ s &quot; &quot; : rituals , relationships , restrictions .
so that was the idea behind this .
so that you don &apos;t have a character that looks limp , but actually a character that you can use in an action film straight away , that looks kind of alive in midair as well .
video : three , two , one , go !
( laughter ) decoration of the unfinished project is a kind of conceptual incubation .
and they didn &apos;t say anything .
now i &apos;m going to give you a story .
but having committed to the process , i continued on , and something really surprising came out of this .
so for six days , i lived in front of a webcam .
every time her ex-boyfriend would show up , at the most improbable times and the most improbable locations , he was carrying an open laptop , and over time carol realized that he had planted a gps tracking device on her car , so she was calling me for help to disable it .
and limor designed this , in part , because , like carol , she felt threatened by gps tracking .
the problem is , imagine if we actually started to reconsider how we designed things .
and so what happens is , we waste more food .
this is why we have these four-minute dates .
not yours , of course — other people &apos;s .
and when it comes to plastic bags , less than five percent gets recycled .
and here comes lesson number three : persistence .
leading with beauty means rising above what is merely necessary .
such acts of beautification may not be pretty , but they are much needed .
tamara , are you recording ?
the only difference is that you &apos;ve got the ability to add in links and slightly more content . are you now ready ?
so , as she mentioned , that is overstated for sure , but that &apos;s why they called me the godfather of modern street skating .
you punch it up , and then when i would do that , it was throwing my shoulder this way ...
so in one level it went from something like 13 dollars to 266 , literally in the space of four months , and then crashed and lost half of its value in six hours .
so you think about loyalty .
this is the income distribution of the united states , 1970 .
they move up into that corner .
when she was a young girl , she had been mutilated against her will .
on a typical day , do you wake up with hope or gloom ?
you &apos;re the chaplain .
( laughter ) how is that raising awareness ?
human beings want to be happy .
i believe , if kennedy was alive today , he would be asking statisticians such as myself to go out and find out what makes life worthwhile .
this is a sculpture i made , which is a way of , kind of , freeing a form into an object that has different degrees of freedom .
okay . thank you .
and in all these 42 cases , when we kept pushing them back , there was three kinds of reaction .
my experiences over the last 18 months , as a lawyer , has seeded in me a new entrepreneurial idea , which i believe is indeed worth spreading .
committed sex is premeditated sex .
give me predictability , give me surprise .
this is actually showing a piece of muscle and how we go through the structures to actually engineer the muscle .
we coat the outside with these muscle cells .
we do all kinds of things .
so i don &apos;t like the word &quot; &quot; futurist . &quot; &quot; i think we should be now-ists , like we are right now .
shoot a video ; expose injustice ; reveal the truth ; show us what &apos;s wrong with the world ; and maybe we can help make it right .
( music ) text : uganda ratified the convention against torture in 1986 .
this is soap that &apos;s made from silver nanoparticles , which have antibacterial properties .
and he actually — once he releases a batch of it , he regularly conducts molecular analyses and posts the results online , so you can go online and look at your batch number and see how the phenolics are developing , and , you know , gauge its freshness .
in meetings , he looks out for the person in the room — arms crossed , looking a bit bemused — and draws them into the discussion , trying to see if they indeed are the person with a different opinion , so that they have dissent within the room .
in every single subject , you &apos;ll be relieved to hear .
so you &apos;re going to put your thumb on top of this .
believe me , those little classrooms are really noisy .
and so very quickly you can accumulate a bunch of links , and it makes it more likely for newcomers to link to you in the future , and then you get this kind of shape .
that little list there would change .
now there are all kinds of paper towel dispensers .
audience : shake . fold .
and what i felt about that building is that it really was a building that had to do with a lightness of being — to quote kundera — that it had to do with whiteness , it had to do with a certain dynamic quality and it had to do with optimism .
and here &apos;s the building as it opened , with a channel overlooking downtown , and as seen from downtown .
so the first two applications are breast cancer and prostate cancer .
one is , think about the amount of suffering that is saved from patients undergoing noninvasive surgery , and also the economical and emotional burden removed from their families and communities and the society at large — and i think also from their physicians , by the way .
imagine juggling a snowball across the tropics .
each storm scours the atmosphere , washing out dust , soot , trace chemicals , and depositing them on the snow pack year after year , millennia after millennia , creating a kind of periodic table of elements that at this point is more than 11,000 feet thick .
and in summer , it &apos;s almost manic hunting and working activity very long hours , very active .
so , what would our natural rhythm look like ?
a kind of wikipedia for stuff ?
contrary to almost everything that you might get taught at an architecture school , copying is good .
attention is the basis of all higher cognitive and emotional abilities .
matthieu &apos;s own experience is that compassion is the happiest state ever .
( music ) &#91; &quot; &quot; i &apos;m not a prophet or a stone-age man , just a mortal with the potential of a superman ...
can you hear me , major tom ? can you hear me , major tom ? can you hear me , major tom ?
in 2002 , nelson otwoma , a kenyan social scientist , discovered he had hiv and needed access to treatment .
so what &apos;s the problem ?
and so i ended up walking like this .
i &apos;ll be doing a swimming lesson later , for myself , if anyone wants to join me .
home is a transient concept .
they are dying of sadness . &quot; &quot; &quot; motherland is motherland . i will never leave . &quot;
you see , knowing that you weren &apos;t the only one changes everything .
the next day , hannah wakes up with a pounding headache .
and i want you to think about the community that you want to be part of creating .
this is a photograph taken about 100 years ago of my grandfather and great-grandfather .
so as you &apos;ll guess , this is a hospital .
for example , ayr muir in boston knew he wanted to open a restaurant .
( laughter ) so something interesting had to be going on .
because there was no mechanism in this explanation for making this structure hard to bend .
however , over the years , tools have become more and more specialized .
but we &apos;ve also looked at other ways to create more complex shape change .
they produced flyers . they called offices .
we know how to do this better , and it &apos;s time to do better .
risks of spaces that have never been so dizzying , as they should be , for a pioneering city .
and yet , i believe it is the expression — expression of the city , expression of our own space — that gives meaning to architecture .
so , i decided i was going to become a scuba diver at the age of 15 .
and i thought like , &quot; &quot; wow . i &apos;m like , living in a science fiction movie .
and my heart sank , because i thought , here we are again .
was what was happening in ghana a metaphor for what was happening in me ?
but when it gets too hot , the algae can &apos;t make the sugar .
and they tasted really good .
we now have the tools . we now have the possibilities .
it has been used to help communities prepare for disasters .
and i really like that , because the viewer is really challenged as to what visual language is part of science versus art versus music .
on that grid , i can then weave the high tide readings , water temperature , air temperature and moon phases .
( applause )
so , music videos are something that i always found interesting , but they always seem to be so reactive .
likewise , as we &apos;re developing policies to try to encourage exports , if we know there &apos;s this externality — this extra thing that &apos;s going to happen as we increase exports — we can think about what the right kinds of policies are .
it &apos;s a huge change in a very short period of time .
i &apos;ve been shooting time-lapse flowers continuously , non-stop , 24 hours a day , seven days a week , for over 30 years , and to see them move is a dance i &apos;ll never get tired of .
each one has an incredible story behind their face , a story that you could never fully fathom , not only their own story , but the story of their ancestors .
but i firmly believe , which is why i get up and do what i do every single day , that we can make different choices here .
now , we can have a circular argument here about whether this increase in fatalities is a response to the increase of small arms , or the other way around .
that &apos;s what keeps you from getting help .
that &apos;s the stigma , because unfortunately , we live in a world where if you break your arm , everyone runs over to sign your cast , but if you tell people you &apos;re depressed , everyone runs the other way .
i found out that salt lake city and san francisco were different .
i will swap the bubbles to a map .
there &apos;s a thermoregulation mechanism in there that keeps constant temperature .
venus , of course , is the god of love and fertility , which is the flower story .
and three hours later , that fire had reduced my home and every last thing in it except for me to ash .
and in fact , in canada &apos;s largest city , toronto , the average resident today is what used to be called a foreigner , somebody born in a very different country .
it &apos;s just a big blue surface .
so some of them actually seem to have powers like superheroes in a comic book .
i know you know the idea , natural selection , but let me just paraphrase &quot; &quot; the origin of species , &quot; &quot; 1859 , in a few sentences .
the way to think about memes , though , is to think , why do they spread ?
so this is a drug called reboxetine , and this is a drug that i myself have prescribed . it &apos;s an antidepressant .
now we expect that to happen with silly stories about precognition , but the problem is , we have exactly the same problem in academia and in medicine , and in this environment , it costs lives .
and this is not mumbo-jumbo philosophy .
all that &apos;s separating you from him , from the other person , is your skin .
way too much money , i just can &apos;t even go there , with lawyers , trying to figure out how this is different , who &apos;s responsible to whom , and the result was that we were able to provide owners protection for their own driving records and their own history .
that &apos;s peer-to-peer .
and when we talk about women , they are either exceptions to be dismissed or aberrations to be ignored .
and she had come to washington , not seeking a handout and not seeking a microloan .
here &apos;s a study published by a team of researchers as an op-ed in the new york times .
really cool stuff .
january 2014 , more than 500 million .
( laughter ) and in fact , in that case , it &apos;s not only not abusive , it &apos;s technically just an accurate greeting . ( laughter )
because we are counting on you .
it was built by the timber of her majesty &apos;s ship resolute and given by queen victoria .
to do this , there &apos;s only two simple steps to follow .
what we can do is we can take our mice and then we can put them in a box that looks exactly like this box here , and then we can give them a very mild foot shock so that they form a fear memory of this box .
you have to have something that actually interacts with people .
so let &apos;s look at some projects .
as adults we admire the lap from a nostalgic distance .
on a crowded bus there was always a lap to sit on .
we landed with 40 kilos .
this can be in environment , in finance , in education of children .
and we &apos;re going to try to understand what &apos;s happening in his brain .
so what we see is that this neuron knows whenever the rat has gone into one particular place in its environment .
warren berger says that design thinking teaches us to look sideways , to reframe , to refine , to experiment and , probably most importantly , ask those stupid questions .
i had the benefit of a spectrum this wide .
the results can be spectacular .
and to my surprise , he actually wrote back .
( laughter ) beyond flying , breathing fire , and making hot men spontaneously appear ... ( laughter )
the feel of water on my skin was like pins and needles , and so for years , i refused to shower .
so brazil has 1,782 millimeters per year of precipitation of rain .
so that is the chapter two : the oil era .
but where are we now ?
what &apos;s the countdown look like ? i can &apos;t see .
do you want to know ?
and as he did , he told me how he had come to the city from his village .
well i will show you here .
it &apos;s when the young couple whisper , &quot; tonight we are going to make a baby . &quot;
arguably the financial markets have failed us and the aid system is failing us , and yet i stand firmly with the optimists who believe that there has probably never been a more exciting moment to be alive .
i would say that the converse is true .
chris anderson : ethan , congrats — quite the reaction .
will more people use marijuana ?
and this was a cause for celebration .
and for that , the audience — the lovely , beautiful audience — would live happily ever after .
they are able to respond to gravity , of course , so the shoots are growing against the vector of gravity and the roots toward the vector of gravity .
noah needed to take two of every kind of bird , of every kind of animal , of every kind of creature that moves , but no mention about plants .
this is better than the performance of many oecd countries .
by the time i left , we had gone up to almost 30 billion dollars . and as we speak now , we have about 40 billion dollars in reserves due to proper management of our finances .
why should you make words ?
&#91; &quot; &quot; go rob other people &quot; &quot; &#93; ( laughter ) linguists call this borrowing , but we never give the words back , so i &apos;m just going to be honest and call it stealing .
and i saw how splendor can illuminate even the most abject vulnerabilities .
this one is from 1968 — the atlantic monthly , voice of liberal america — written by an important bioethicist .
and this means the soil below has a healthy fungal network .
all we have to do is to bring these elements together and let nature take over .
really simple , really effective , really life-saving .
and if you can do that , you can rise out of poverty .
but don &apos;t take my word for it — come with me .
in fact , dolphins actually help sharks feed more effectively .
so i think we &apos;re at a kind of impasse here .
the whole idea of the inner subjective movie involves a kind of illusion or confusion .
so it is really unlikely that we will be around to see the higgs field collapse .
because of quantum tunneling , i could disappear from this room and reappear in the next room , practically penetrating the wall .
you &apos;re going to see the action , three against three , completely autonomous .
now , this robot is currently our star robot .
they got this statement of accomplishment .
sebastian &apos;s teaching another class now .
the department stores are multistory ; they &apos;re better built .
that land is more valuable than just surface parking lots .
that &apos;s our youngest beta tester , down there on the right .
video : the orange tractor .
he takes his geological data , he publishes it and he holds a contest on the internet called the goldcorp challenge .
i mean , one is , fitness is no longer optional . ( laughter ) you know ? or if you &apos;re going to be naked , you &apos;d better get buff .
these soybeans are being shipped to europe and to china as animal feed , especially after the mad cow disease scare about a decade ago , where we don &apos;t want to feed animals animal protein anymore , because that can transmit disease .
well , we could try to farm more land .
why ?
because there &apos;s so many different wall types . &quot; &quot; so we thought about it , we optimized it , and we came up with three different screws to put in the box .
well , not quite . because darwin was talking about our distant ancestry , our common ancestry with apes .
but looking around the world at the diversity of humans , he said , &quot; well , you know , we seem to come in discreet sub-species or categories . &quot;
you must have gotten your education here . &quot; &quot; it turned out , in every single case , they came out of the indian educational system .
for example , 24 / 7 customer , traditional call center company , used to be a traditional call center company . today they &apos;re developing analytical tools to do predictive modeling so that before you pick up the phone , you can guess or predict what this phone call is about .
to give you a perspective , if i had to translate the proportion of psychiatrists in the population that one might see in britain to india , one might expect roughly 150,000 psychiatrists in india .
two men , rahul and rajiv , living in the same neighborhood , from the same educational background , similar occupation , and they both turn up at their local accident emergency complaining of acute chest pain .
and in stand-up of course , the stand-up comedian is supposed to dominate the audience .
where you deny the other person &apos;s reality , you have paradox where you allow more than one reality to coexist , i think there &apos;s another philosophical construction .
( applause )
but more than that , your brain gets measurably bigger .
now the new global goals are explicitly universal .
how much ? enough to get us to the global goals ?
we are all now deeply , deeply , deeply interconnected .
they will remain the most powerful nation , but they will be the most powerful nation in an increasingly multi-polar world .
now , as i put this hololens on , let me explain the setup a little bit .
hw : amazing . ok , jeff , please go away . thank you very much .
and this gave us very high confidence for what we were looking at .
the rotor is that moving part within the centrifuge , that black object that you see .
these are not just crop plants , as you might have seen stored in svalbard in norway — fantastic work there .
2,800 dollars per species is the average .
five years ago my mother and i went back to chau doc .
the communist khmer rouge enters phnom penh to liberate their people from the encroaching conflict in vietnam , and american bombing campaigns .
let me tell you , this was a strange way to shave , because i thought about it and i realized that the way i was shaving then would be the way i would shave for the rest of my life — because i had to keep the width the same .
and this was very surprising to me , because i &apos;ve gone through many treatments — there were many treatments i decided not to do — and i never got this guilt trip to this extent .
( applause )
and they wanted to be welcoming to the outside community .
but what are they guarding ?
the great game connotes dominance of one over the other .
we have some preliminary evidence from bargaining that early warning signs in the brain might be used to predict whether there will be a bad disagreement that costs money , and chimps are better competitors than humans , as judged by game theory .
the chimp is going to see , watch carefully , they &apos;re going to see 200 milliseconds &apos; exposure — that &apos;s fast , that &apos;s eight movie frames — of numbers one , two , three , four , five .
i don &apos;t know why exactly i think that , but that &apos;s what i think .
it was especially hard to hear about the beatings and the burnings and the lynchings of black men .
i &apos;ve been doing this for 30 years .
and i ask you , stand with us as we create futures without violence for women and girls and men and boys everywhere .
( applause )
my name is henry evans , and until august 29 , 2002 , i was living my version of the american dream .
and here are the results of this wonderful project that is the system in venezuela .
gustavo dudamel !
and it really works to start with them .
so , we have our ganges and yamuna cleanup project .
i have a two-year-old daughter who &apos;s the best thing ever .
the mechanism that drives it has nine motors and about 3,000 pulleys .
they &apos;re not waiting until they die to create foundations .
this is not something that happens far away to people that we don &apos;t know .
i set up a makeshift portrait studio by the barricades on hrushevsky street .
in maidan , the barricades have been dismantled , and the paving stones which were used as weapons during the protests replaced , so that traffic flows freely through the center of the square .
( laughter ) and before we reach our final destination , ladies and gentlemen , i would like to share with you some technology that i brought all the way from the thriving metropolis of brisbane .
( guzheng ) ( beatboxing ) germany . ( beatboxing )
one of these four different shapes is actually a rotated version of this shape . i want you to tell me which one : the first one , second one , third one or fourth one ?
now in a sense , when we think about the effect of video games on the brain , it &apos;s very similar to the effect of wine on the health .
you don &apos;t wake up one day no longer a racist .
and number two , obviously , this dependence upon the funders produces a subtle , understated , camouflaged bending to keep the funders happy .
( applause ) the ata is the first telescope built from a large number of small dishes , and hooked together with computers .
and no one would decide that the ocean was without fish on the basis of one glass of water .
but of course , all of the soft tissue has decomposed , and the skeleton itself has limited health information .
the most important health challenges today are not caused by simple mutations in our genome , but rather result from a complex and dynamic interplay between genetic variation , diet , microbes and parasites and our immune response .
joyce &apos;s mother is now taking care of her daughter , like so many other zimbabwean children who &apos;ve been orphaned by the epidemic .
i thought he would ask for a toy , or candy , and he asked me for slippers , because he said that his feet were cold .
so he got joshua bell to take his million dollar violin down to a washington d.c. subway station and stand in the corner and see how much money he would make .
i use jackson pollock on purpose as an example because there &apos;s a young american artist who paints very much in the style of jackson pollock , and her work was worth many tens of thousands of dollars — in large part because she &apos;s a very young artist .
we put it in the equivalent of splints .
people have tried very hard to do this .
you might choose china , which is the bulk of that east asian blue line , where there &apos;s 200 million young people , and every year until 2010 that &apos;s getting bigger .
the other guy had to say , i &apos;m going to build 50 new schools .
now , we know design won &apos;t solve all the world &apos;s problems .
the wheels had started to turn .
these were the low-tech approaches to the high-tech conversations i was having .
it completely blows apart the way that perfume is , and provides a whole new format .
this bit , the big secret of automotive design — reflection management .
is it beautiful now ?
this guy was my kind of like mentor .
we &apos;re so used to working in one vector .
they use it a lot for defense , many different ways .
his flesh fuses with her flesh , her bloodstream grows into his body , and he becomes nothing more than a little sperm sac .
and it is this continuous , synchronous oscillation within the cell that allows it to form quite a complex understanding of its environment , but without any large-scale control center .
and after all , it has its own internal aesthetics .
i think that actually this type of urban design , which became more prevalent in the 1970s and 1980s — i think there is a relationship between that and the country becoming more conservative under ronald reagan .
literally there are people who might be in school in arkansas or tennessee and might never interact in a positive affirmative way with someone from another part of the country , or of another racial group .
now the choosing begins .
a resume tells a story .
and what was also one of the bigger projects around that was moving 13 full-size cities up out of the reservoir , and flattening all the buildings so they could make way for the ships .
the other aspect of what &apos;s happening in china is that there &apos;s a real need for materials there .
only about 12 species of mosquitos carry most of the world &apos;s malaria , and we know quite a bit about the kinds of watery habitats that they specialize in .
they understood the cultural challenge .
over 2.6 billion people depend on it every single day .
so how do we fix this ?
and it &apos;s a welcoming area , i think , inclusive of diversity , reflective of diversity , and i think this marriage of both technology and art in the public sector is an area where the u.s.
it takes your attention ; it has a great amount of emotion ; it stares back at you the way that a figure might .
i mean , have a look at this graph .
they had the god complex in spades .
it &apos;s that realization of someone you meet that really made you change your ideas about the world .
the course was good , but it was not the course content in itself that changed the mindset .
so the first is when the scale is that , we need to recognize that just the simple things that are infrastructure — it takes six years to deliver infrastructure .
will democracy flourish ? what scares you most ?
and they tell us that even if we do it by astrology , they ’ re happy .
s-h , quite a different frequency .
i exist because there are stories , and if there are no stories , we don &apos;t exist .
so , in my mind , in the future , they started to build flyovers .
and i keep it going , and i just got , ( laughter ) also , this suggestion from milan : it &apos;s our traffic divider , which we call &quot; &quot; panettone , &quot; &quot; and it &apos;s painted ; it &apos;s these beautiful concrete things that you use around milan to define all the lanes of traffic .
and then , for instance , this other exhibition that was entitled workspheres in 2001 , where i asked different designers to come up with ideas for the new type of work styles that were happening in the world at that time .
and it &apos;s the only market segment that &apos;s growing .
it &apos;s traditionally called the informal economy , the underground economy , the black market .
and this is what i said .
in the incredible intricacy and magnificence of the natural world .
now the reason why this is important is because , by virtue of just viewing web pages in this way , i can look at my entire browsing history in the exact same way .
what we &apos;re done here is we &apos;ve taken every single wikipedia page and we reduced it down to a little summary .
we were talking about dancing ponies , but i was really jealous of the walker arts center for putting up this festival , because it &apos;s very , very wonderful .
they also preserve artifacts for posterity .
and &quot; &quot; olé ! &quot; &quot; to you , nonetheless .
( laughter ) &quot; &quot; do i look like i can write down a song right now ?
that &apos;s why we must have that long-term perspective , but we must measure the impact over 10-year periods .
this is the vision we have , isn &apos;t it .
they do this with their toes . it &apos;s bizarre ! this peeling inspired irobot — that we work with — to build mecho-geckos .
how can you make sense of this ? well , we believed — and we hypothesized — that one way animals could work simply , is if the control of their movements tended to be built into their bodies themselves .
more to come as we think about trying to make the world a smaller place .
all right , you &apos;ve all heard the term : &quot; he &apos;s a born surgeon . &quot;
because like a racing car , any patient , when things start to go bad , you have a short time to make a difference .
and then , we applied an application on top which would allow us to tease out the patterns in the data in real time so we could see what was happening , so we could determine when things started to change .
it &apos;s a tiny , little island — 60 miles by 90 miles .
it was a fairy tale , and then we retired .
so what do we take from all of this ?
( laughter ) so what we &apos;ve just done now is a turing test for poetry .
it &apos;s just 29 words in arabic , but anywhere from 65 to 72 in translation .
and where the bible is addressed exclusively to men , using the second and third person masculine , the koran includes women — talking , for instance , of believing men and believing women , honorable men and honorable women .
so in my 12 years of wisdom , i zip my pants down , i walk out into the room , and lo and behold to me , while i was in the room with sheila , johnny was back at the window calling guys up .
his mother had died from a heroin overdose .
now all those styles of rhythm are all counted in four and then subdivided by three .
now let &apos;s take those three groups of four and make them four groups of three .
i also want to use this work to let more people pay attention to the living condition of artists and the condition of their creative freedom .
i made them invisible in the deserted shop wherethey had lived and worked all their lives .
what would knowing whether or not we were still together really tell them ?
and this question is really what i want to talk about today .
israeli scientists frederic libersat and ram gal found that the venom is a very specific chemical weapon .
it has no consciousness .
and they &apos;re similar . they have to consciously open their nose .
but this creature that you &apos;ve just seen ultimately adapts , and keeps adapting and adapting .
and so this is the important point that i like to study : that things are beautiful , that it &apos;s still a human connection — it &apos;s just done in a different way .
so that &apos;s why i study cyborg anthropology .
( laughter ) you know , we spent a lot of time ideating and even building some of these things .
the little lego car in the beginning of the video references the big , real car near the end of the video .
at least he &apos;ll get treated while we try to figure out the money situation .
so mzalendo was one small way we thought we could start inspiring people to start holding their leaders accountable .

so bpa mimics the body &apos;s own hormones and causes neurological and reproductive problems .
i &apos;m also making a decompiculture kit , a cocktail of capsules that contain infinity mushroom spores and other elements that speed decomposition and toxin remediation .
and the answer to that is research .
there are just way too few eye care professionals .
this guy also liked plain water and the muscle relaxant .
and then i swap it out with the students and actually re-release that carbon black .
so , i have now showed you three projects , and you might ask yourself , what is it good for ?
( music : &quot; &quot; teardrop &quot; &quot; by massive attack ) ( applause ) thank you very much .
over nearly all of earth &apos;s history , threats have come from nature — disease , earthquakes , asteroids and so forth — but from now on , the worst dangers come from us .
it &apos;s an important maxim that the unfamiliar is not the same as the improbable , and in fact , that &apos;s why we at cambridge university are setting up a center to study how to mitigate these existential risks .
&quot; &quot; make this world a better place , if you can .
that &apos;s why the prime minister went on television . he said , &quot; &quot; this has left us all with a very big haddock . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) a lot of what i do — i have to try and make sense of things before i can make nonsense of them .
( applause )
and just as the woman who wanted to know me as an adult got to know me , she turned into a box of ashes and was placed in my hands .
and so we spent time traveling with them and learning about all the different elements , and finding that there were plenty of inefficiencies that weren &apos;t being capitalized on .
so it felt this has a social dimension .
so let me take you back four years before the trees .
so it was easy , so we were suddenly left with nothing , because the guerrilla were spreading the word that all of those things are done because if they don &apos;t do it , they &apos;re in danger .
i joined the wildlife conservation society , working there , in 1995 , but i started working with them as a student in 1991 .
and i wanted to do it , because — i believed — to continue my studies .
&quot; &quot; picture in a frame , ashes in a bottle , boundless energy confined in the bottle , forcing me to deal with reality , forcing me to deal with being grown up .
after he died , i realized that no one writes to me anymore .
indeed , it will decrease neurogenesis .
how about sex ?
of course , you &apos;ve just heard and you already know that we &apos;re running out of antibiotics .
they just grow and divide , and grow and divide — so a kind of boring life , except that what i would argue is that you have an amazing interaction with these critters .
and his desire is to rescue islam from images of intolerance , all in a child-friendly format .
and it &apos;s called &quot; &quot; the 99 . &quot; &quot; now , these are the world &apos;s first islamic superheroes .
been here for a short while , and i &apos;m starting to understand a little bit better .
dl : what about leahy ? ( laughter ) nm : just tell them what — dl : she wants me to talk about — we have a band named leahy .
so i picked a camarasaurus , because the camarasaurus was the most abundant of the sauropods in north america .
and then she started doing these other images .
people would come in , find their own seat , move it a bit , actually , and then stay a while , and then interestingly , people themselves attracted other people , and ironically , i felt more peaceful if there were other people around .
now , this proved very valuable 20 years later when michael bloomberg asked me to be his planning commissioner and put me in charge of shaping the entire city of new york .
and these women are working so hard to get their voices heard in some very difficult circumstances .
thank you .
the vast majority of people , they pick and choose , they see compromise and they change over time when they hear a better argument or a worse argument .
you have democrats overwhelmingly supportive of raising the income tax on people who make 250,000 dollars a year , republicans sort of against it , although if you break it out by income , republicans who make less than 75,000 dollars a year like this idea .
when medicine became somewhat scientific , in about 450 bc , with hippocrates and those boys , they tried to look for herbs , plants that would literally shake the bad spirits out .
it didn &apos;t work very well on the schizophrenics , but it was pretty clear in the &apos; 30s and by the middle of the &apos; 40s that electroconvulsive therapy was very , very effective in the treatment of depression .
they would , in fact , be part of a sierra leone where war and amputation were no longer a strategy for gaining power .
we use a 3d printer to create a multi-material prosthetic socket which relieves pressure where needed on the anatomy of the patient .
there is shock , followed by a long silence .
and it &apos;s because of those words that i stand here right now full of passion , asking you to be brave for the kids who are dreaming those dreams today .
a loving dispute with your girl or boyfriend .
but it was important to create a perfect place , so i tried to , in order to work and create .
or an expensive watch , so you can impress people — &quot; oh gee , i didn &apos;t know you had that watch . &quot;
and when it &apos;s finished , you put it vertically , and now the tea is — you remember — above this line and the water only comes to here — and so it keeps the tea out .
so here are some designers who are trying to understand what it might feel like to sleep in a confined space on an airplane .
but really , it wasn ’ t the drugs that were important ; it was this idea that what the drugs did would help shock people out of their normal way of thinking , and getting them to forget the adult behaviors that were getting in the way of their ideas .
okay , so when that happens everything lines up .
so , what does the astrolabe inspire ?
that was fantastic .
and for many of us , our fortunes do indeed lie at the bottom of the pyramid . thank you .
when oshea was a teenager , he murdered mary &apos;s only son , laramiun byrd , in a gang fight .
this is 12-year-old joshua littman interviewing his mother , sarah .
the poem is called &quot; &quot; libation , &quot; &quot; and it &apos;s for my friend vusi who is in the audience here somewhere . &quot; &quot; libation ,
i was seven .
what was i going to say next ?
should have done this before i tried to pitch it .
eh , no .
but the next week , this was the first cartoon .
everything else around that is blurry , rendering much of what is presented to our eyes as ambiguous .
what is it about what one person is thinking and feeling that leads them to see the world in an entirely different way ?
thank you . ( applause )
the idea of finding a different technology had absolutely taken over , and there were tiny , tiny little factories in backwaters .
and so we need to be able to pick that apart and find the information that &apos;s relevant .
but that actually indicates a lack of understanding of how terrorist investigations actually work .
looks simple , but we &apos;ve reiterated this dozens of times by going into the field to talk to doctors , moms and clinicians to ensure that this really meets the needs of the local communities .
if it &apos;s battling hypothermia , its organs can &apos;t develop normally , resulting in a range of health problems from diabetes , to heart disease , to low i.q.
and that was also shocking , because suddenly , i realized , as the captain said to me , that i had been crazy to choose to go through pirate waters on a container ship .
but there are no laws governing acoustic pollution yet .
let &apos;s value the stories that young people bring to the schoolhouse .
and when we met him he was very resistant .
i was detained for 12 days , blindfolded , handcuffed .
there was no leader .
ks : yay !
kathryn schulz : and that &apos;s how it goes .
if you ever doubt the power of graphic design , this is a very generic sign that literally says , &quot; &quot; vote for hitler . &quot; &quot; it says nothing else .
if you allow that to happen , it &apos;s really the only way you can do some unique work , and you &apos;re going to enjoy the work a lot more as well .
if innovation is less powerful , invents less great , wonderful things , then growth is going to be even lower than half of history .
what if i try to fit a curved line to this historical record ?
we can see tendons and muscles .
maybe i can add quickly this way .
because after all , god is &#91; working through &#93; the messiah . he &apos;s going to fix all this . &quot; &quot; it becomes impenetrable .
and about 20 years went by .
what , if i were to boil it down , would be the one image that i could hang my hat on for this ?
the circle that , when we come to act ii and there &apos;s a drought , how do you express drought ?
i want you to consider for a moment if you really don &apos;t want the distracted teenager behind you to know that you &apos;re braking , that you &apos;re coming to a dead stop .
if one guy has a really great car , but they &apos;re on their phone or , you know , doing something , they &apos;re not probably in the best position to react in an emergency .
then what we do is we increase the velocity a little bit .
and here &apos;s the robot operating at 10 times the speed of the human .
from china to brazil , these projects attempt to provide as many houses as possible , but they &apos;re completely generic and simply do not work as an answer to the individual needs of the people .

we are on an amazing journey the next four days .
so the patient &apos;s life is restored .
i &apos;ve chosen to show this profile view of sue because what it shows is her lower jaw jutting forward and her lower lip jutting forward .
and if i could communicate just one thing to remi and to sam and to you , it would be that you don &apos;t have to be normal .
but most people don &apos;t agree .
the transportation is all very simple , everybody &apos;s within a five-minute walk of mobility .
( applause ) so , the question is , how many federal officials are ready to move to ohio and pennsylvania with their families ?
i know what it is to suffer , and i feel that if there is a crime , a person should be tried fairly and punished . &quot; &quot; but she reached out to us in that way , and it was , i &apos;d like to say , it was an ice-breaker .
so the story with zacarias was too much really .
we fear the sound of our own voice , for it means admission , but it is this that gives us the power to change our environment .
let us fight the shame and talk about it .
ideas , language , even the phrase &apos; each other &apos; no longer makes any sense . &quot; &quot; i humbly add — humbly add — that out beyond the worlds of war and peace , there is a field , and there are many women and men &#91; who &#93; are meeting there .
think of how the world can be a much better place if , for a change , we have a better equality , we have equality , we have a representation and we understand war , both from the front-line and the back-line discussion .
teenagers with low body confidence do less physical activity , eat less fruits and vegetables , partake in more unhealthy weight control practices that can lead to eating disorders .
it is absolutely gorgeous .
( laughter ) tl : but we can see that it actually works , even though you can only hold it for a little bit of time .
and also , colors , lighting , sound and effects can dynamically respond to your emotional state to heighten the experience that you &apos;re having , in real time .
one journey from london to new york .
what &apos;s the design brief ?
over the course of two and a half months i lost my spleen , my kidneys , the hearing in my left ear and both of my legs below the knee .
i started snowboarding , then i went back to work , then i went back to school .
i first went to ethiopia in 1967 .
are we going to look our grandchildren in the eye and tell them that we understood the issues , that we recognized the dangers and the opportunities , and still we failed to act ?
and infants die .
you have to design an artificial foot for such conditions .
but if we want to understand it much more regularly , we need lots of satellites , and this model isn &apos;t scalable .
it cost 855 million dollars .
the first happened in 1997 , in which garry kasparov , a human , lost to deep blue , a machine .
they found a treasure trove of documents : 700 biographical sketches of foreign fighters .
and , so now , when the polar ice caps melt , my recording studio will rise up like an ark , and i &apos;ll float off into the drowned world like a character from a j.g. ballard novel .
and she was hot .
and the context i &apos;m talking about is where you need to have a product that is less than 200 dollars .
now what &apos;s powerful about this model is when you bring together all these stakeholders that represent each link in the chain from inception of an idea all the way to implementation in the field , that &apos;s where the magic happens .
so it &apos;s not surprising that , about 12 years ago , when noam and i were already computer science professors , we were equally frustrated by the same phenomenon .
they were too busy building a family and a country .
and this , this is the implantable generation .
if i talk about migraine , 40 percent of the population suffer episodic headaches .
im : it &apos;s always low-fat buttermilk .
and here is the last bit .
it &apos;s risk . it &apos;s reward . it &apos;s randomness .
and it would be easy to implement and inexpensive .
have you ever had a conversation with yourself and then suddenly realized you &apos;re a real asshole to yourself ?
have you ever had a nagging feeling that one day you will be discovered as a fraud ?
but i think the most interesting thing about baxter is the user interface .
that means there will be more people with fewer social security dollars competing for services .
how much will it take to buy an apartment or a car , to get married , or to put my child through school ?
the workers i got to know had a curiously abstract relationship with the product of their labor .
by revealing your zodiac sign , you are also being evaluated .
why ?
so relax , do it again .
and so , just relax your hand .
this is the gay agenda : equality . not special rights , but the rights that were already written by these people — these elitists , if you will .
love and respect — that &apos;s what the whole film was about .
ca : no , trust me , it &apos;s gross .
i mean , couldn &apos;t you have used the virgin brand for that as well ?
we &apos;re using them for people , we &apos;re using them for places , we &apos;re using them for your products , we &apos;re using them for events .
now , 20 years on , at ted , i want to ask your help in a new reframing .
and please buy them .
and so what is this teaching us ?
we were a little bit rattled .
she &apos;d kind of look at him , like &quot; &quot; what are you doing ? &quot; &quot; go back and get them , and then bring them back and drop them in front of him .
we hope not , or maybe we just hope to make miracles a little more common .
it &apos;s an extraordinarily toxic thing .
and i also found that hollywood and silicon valley have a lot more in common than i would have dreamed .
i &apos;ve actually been waiting by the phone for a call from ted for years .
she wanted to dance .
because it ’ s a problem we have .
we need an exercise .
the pace of life is often frantic , our minds are always busy , and we &apos;re always doing something .
i &apos;m human . i make mistakes .

when he was eight , someone put him on a boat in odessa and sent him , shipped him to israel on his own .
i found out that they had a very hard time dealing with frustration and difficulties — not because they were physically unfit .
one young woman had great grades , but test scores were not as high .
but when i looked at the data , what i found was that , quite frankly , students in general , large numbers were not making it .
and i have an oasis .
essentially it had done something very simple .
it &apos;s wired into us .
you can imagine how that plays out in combat .
and so , in fact , if you know you have these kleptoparasitic bees , you know that your environment is healthy , because they &apos;re top-of-the-food-chain bees .
and bats are dying at an extraordinary rate .
that &apos;s not only in the developing world .
so i did just that .
