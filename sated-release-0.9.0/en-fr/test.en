thank you .
but what about ourselves , and what about our reality ?
that &apos;s our library with more handcrafted furniture .
i went out and hired a student of frank lloyd wright , the architect , and i asked him to build me a world class center in the worst neighborhood in pittsburgh .
so he got the right weight at birth .
nobody taught us how to deal with such kinds of disabilities , and as many questions as possible started to come to our minds .
but they happened to be wild dogs living there , and it was right by the water , so there were swans and ducks swimming around and trees growing everywhere and bees nesting in the sugar barrels .
i also started looking around in the city and trying to photograph them .
( music ) for any of you who have visited or lived in new york city , these shots might start to look familiar .
we &apos;re sometimes contacted by people in other parts of the world who can &apos;t travel to the united states , but would like to hear this record .
data had nothing to do with its success .
you force those words to connect to what you want to think of and form ideas .
and you don &apos;t know what the future will hold , but it &apos;s not going to get a lower percentage .
as time went on , we stopped our environmental programs .
the sweet anxiety of choice .
they are highly unpredictable .
public health experts tell me that that actually cost us in human lives , because by sparking more panic and by sometimes getting the facts wrong , we made it harder for people to resolve what was actually happening on the ground .
our local journalists are our mentors .
( applause )
not likely .
in america , even a bankrupt gambler gets a second chance .
diplomas are a brand .
and what happens is — this is — i &apos;m going to show you now some fallout plumes . within 20 minutes , it comes straight down . within 24 hours , lethal radiation is going out with prevailing winds , and it &apos;s mostly in this particular direction — it &apos;s going northeast .
so , first of all , this would be horrific beyond anything we can possibly imagine .
it shows two black holes in orbit around each other , again , with these helpfully painted curves .
and if one were to eclipse the milky way , this is what it would look like .
now , there are a lot of pieces of dr. bostrom &apos;s argument to unpack , and i don &apos;t have time to unpack them all , but very briefly , consider this : super knowing is very different than super doing .
the humans we are today are not the humans we will be then .
it took folks like darpa , universities , and companies completely outside of the automotive industry to notice that if you were clever about it , autonomy could be done now .
i discovered for the first time that light itself has substance .
when swann is in his jealous throes , and suddenly he &apos;s listening at doorways and bribing his mistress &apos; servants , he defends these behaviors .
the poor creature is just under suspicion for no cause .
and it &apos;s schizophrenic because in their hearts donors know that &apos;s not a realistic agenda , and so what they also do is the total bypass : just fund ngos .
the security council typically has the responsibility for providing the peacekeepers who build the security .
obviously , there &apos;s always the dark side of it .
one of them is the ipi free media pioneer award .
artists too love to play around with symmetry .
now , i &apos;m a great believer that mathematics is not a spectator sport , and you have to do some mathematics in order to really understand it .
we also found that the more people change , the better they got .
you know , when most people think about the diet i recommend , they think it ’ s a really strict diet .
and the war that drove them there was still raging in its fourth year .
well , that is largely europe &apos;s choice .
oftentimes , we think that we have to relate new knowledge to prior knowledge .
it allows us to make sense of the world around us .
and even in the relatively sterile blood , around one to two percent of this information is dark matter — can &apos;t be classified , can &apos;t be typed or matched with anything we &apos;ve seen before .
he came up with a name for his mystery agent .
let me first explain how rezero actually keeps his balance .
it &apos;s like when i am trying to stand on one foot .
pettengill was a 23-year-old vet who had planned to make the army a career , but then he got a severe back injury in iraq , and that forced him to take a medical discharge .
the second thing i want to do is introduce my co-author and dear friend and co-teacher .
at the time i made this picture , stacey was working as an attorney for the state of texas .
george has been involved in alcoholics anonymous and hasn &apos;t had a drink in 36 years .
this methodology , i believe , has a potential .
but to make afforestation as a mainstream business or an industry , we had to standardize the process of forest-making .
now i doubt if anyone in this room would seriously challenge that view .
indeed , one wonders that without a duty of care , how many people would have had to suffer from gastroenteritis before stevenson eventually went out of business .
we like different things .
so it &apos;s overall performance and efficiency just exceeds standard mass produced products .
i don &apos;t think there &apos;s any other way of getting instant feedback that way .
and they tapped into the fact that , if you have millions of people around the world talking about what they &apos;re doing and what &apos;s around them , you have an incredible resource to find out about any topic or event while it &apos;s going on .
if you look on the amazon site , there are over 2,000 titles with advice on the seven habits , the nine choices , the 10 secrets , the 14,000 thoughts that are supposed to bring happiness .
extroverts use it more than introverts .
in tests , participants found the happy , the beautiful , the quiet path far more enjoyable than the shortest one , and that just by adding a few minutes to travel time .
you take your phone out and you know immediately where to go .
this blue neuron is connected with the locomotor center , and what this constellation of synaptic contacts means is that the brain is reconnected with the locomotor center with only one relay neuron .
now , i am sure you are all wondering , aren &apos;t you , will this help injured people ?
it &apos;s a combination of that , the beauty of that , the shape , and the stories that were involved in it , as well as the fact that they protected the contents .
and you can turn the mike on now . i &apos;m going to do a couple of pieces .
( laughter ) this is a high-speed centrifuge .
theory is red , black is experiment .
but nothing else does either .
therefore every moment really is the most important moment that &apos;s ever happened , including this moment right now .
so this shows ...
and so this works the same way ; you pick it up and pop it open .
here &apos;s the overall picture .
we need better tools .
( laughter ) i &apos;m just kidding . ( laughter )
storm chasing is a very tactile experience .
so the microbial community can go wrong whether we want it to or not , or we can kill it with antibiotics , but what can we do to restore it ?
( laughter ) the microbes that cover us .
and last but not least , it is an obsession .
i &apos;m just simply saying that a world without love is a deadly place .
people are starting to figure this out .
this year is a test for us all , especially the leaders of the g8 nations , who really are on the line here , with all the world in history watching .
so as you can see here , this is a , eleven-inch diameter circuit board .
that &apos;s nothing new : that &apos;s a propeller clock ; that &apos;s the rims that you can buy for your car .
but i had no idea what the context was or what that even , what it even meant to the people who heard it .
and so immediately as you meet people , you shake their hand , and then your eyes go to their shoulder , because you want to see where did they serve , or what unit did they serve with ?
i love the way that they see the world , because they &apos;re seeing the world for the first time .
so the awesome story : it begins about 40 years ago , when my mom and my dad came to canada .
it &apos;s a false wall , which contains like 110 cubic feet .
i couldn &apos;t find it .
and here &apos;s what happens if you get a pair of people who share all their dna — namely , clones or identical twins .
and as you can see , large amounts of the brain are not purple , showing that if one person has a thicker bit of cortex in that region , so does his fraternal twin .
gender is how someone presents themselves in society .
women have chest pain , too .
it is truly amazing what you &apos;ve done .
ca : how cool is that ? ( applause ) elon , how have you done this ?
videos created with popcorn behave like the web itself : dynamic , full of links , and completely remixable , and finally allowed to break free from the frame .
so let &apos;s go back , and i &apos;ll show you what you saw . there was a lot there .
we are , should be , morally committed to being the healer of the world .
we feel it at concerts .
we proclaim our liberal values in opposition to fundamentalist islam , and yet — we have repressive policies that detain child asylum seekers , that separate children from their families , and that seize property from refugees .
in theory , refugees have a right to a pathway to integration , or return to the country they &apos;ve come from .
french babies cry on a rising note while german babies end on a falling note , imitating the melodic contours of those languages .
( applause )
that is already happened ; the information and internet revolution has actually gone all the way through our societies in so many different ways , but it hasn &apos;t , in every way , yet touched our government .
we &apos;re working with some of these people .
we are in a remarkable moment here .
now what you need to do , if you &apos;re trying to develop a new treatment for autism or alzheimer &apos;s disease or cancer is to find the right shape in that mix that will ultimately provide benefit and will be safe .
at the same time , it wants to give us things , and what it gives us is basically progress .
the amount of energy is increasing through this little sequence .
i expected him to be incoherent , but , in fact , he walked into the tent and said to me , &quot; hi , ken . where should i sit ? &quot;
he &apos;s dying .
you can see on the microscope slide here , that &apos;s what &apos;s happening in real time .
and so you can see here , old-fashioned technology of the paintbrush being applied .
all right . slightly more for b.
my favorite , by nicodemus jones , is , &quot; whatever else it might do , it will touch your soul . &quot;
there are no commercial profits in this situation .
thank you .
so , this huge floating ice shelf the size of alaska comes from west antarctica .
well , the problem is that we &apos;ve got very complicated forces in the climate system .
you couldn &apos;t give an account of the natural world that didn &apos;t say something about its relationship , for example , to the creation story in the abrahamic tradition , the creation story in the first book of the torah .
for example , every time anybody had a drink , more or less , they poured a little bit on the ground in what &apos;s called the libation , and they gave some to the ancestors .
it &apos;s been estimated that a single ton of soil — fertile soil — contains approximately four million species of bacteria , all unknown .
the p , the first one in &quot; &quot; hippo , &quot; &quot; is for pollution .
this is the euphore smog chamber in spain .
this is the tower in the middle of the rainforest , from above .
his dedication inspired me to come up with this expedition : a run to the south pole where , with an interactive website , i will be able to bring young people , students and teachers from around the world on board the expedition with me , as active members .
but seriously , seriously , we did get along , because we had a common goal of wanting to inspire these young people .
so how can we find a method that will harness this ?
we have to stop .
( applause )
so you take this encrypted vote home as your receipt .
the show was , in a sense , about that .
it &apos;s very much about this causality , consequences .
wow . wow . ( applause ) let &apos;s just stop for a second , actually , and think about that .
and it &apos;s how we can bend the arc of history down towards zero , just doing the things that we know work .
and from this information , we can begin to map the hope spots .
and that &apos;s their problem ; we &apos;re eating them to death .
and it was very exciting and i learned some remarkable things and made some wonderful connections that i want to share with you today .
wrestling with unfamiliar ideas can help clarify your own thinking .
why are we embedded in social networks ?
and then i realized that these individuals would be connected into foursomes with other pairs of people nearby .
well , most of you anyway .
apart from those brief traumas , nothing happens suddenly .
if you don &apos;t attend to something , you can &apos;t be aware of it .
he accesses the file . he has to rewind the tape .
it shipped every one of its computers with that game .
and then , the 92 nuclear power plants that it would take to provide the power would fill up the rest of los angeles .
but i think there &apos;s a case to be made that we should spend at least as much time , if not more , valuing the premise of connecting ideas and not just protecting them .
this is what your office should look like , is part of my message here .
could we understand the basis of cellular life at the genetic level ?
those are just a couple of the approaches and directions that we &apos;re taking .
they know that when you watch t.v. at home , because there are so many choices you can change channels , miss their commercials .
and so abc and sony have devised this new thing where when you step in the line in the supermarket — initially it &apos;ll be safeways . it is safeways ; they &apos;re trying this in three parts of the country right now — you &apos;ll be watching tv .
march 17 through 21 .
( doorbell ) can i help you ?
we made idiotic presentations showing how the citi logo made sense , and how it was really derived from an umbrella , and we made animations of these things , and we came back and forth and back and forth and back and forth .
adults , on the whole , are solemn .
and i think what that does to us psychologically is it creates an equation .
i find that 10 minutes into a story , you know , my son will suddenly say , &quot; &quot; you know , something happened in the playground today that really bothered me . &quot; &quot; and we &apos;ll go off and have a conversation on that .
then another year goes by .
it was also an expensive fight .
resist this , if you can . don &apos;t do this at home .
now clearly , these are environmental and social issues , but that &apos;s not all .
when a leader says , &quot; &quot; not under my watch , &quot; &quot; everything begins to change .
this isn &apos;t one of those rare diseases that we don &apos;t have the solution for .
so really , having more whales in the oceans pooping is really beneficial to the entire ecosystem .
whales in our waters are still low in numbers , however , because they do face a range of other human-induced threats .
i hope you had a nice time at buddy &apos;s party . &quot; &quot; so you guys did pretty good , cool .
girl : y-i-n-d-i-a-n-a .
now , by promoting economic development , i don &apos;t mean anything magical .
one of the very interesting facts is that , in addition , we find that even once we hold constant , statistically , the effect of your own education , the education of everyone else in your metropolitan area also affects your wages .
i left san francisco , where i live , on monday , and i was getting on the plane for this conference .
this is the complication .
always , all the data shows it &apos;s the same , despite the fact that these cities have evolved independently .
so you tell me the size of a mammal , i can tell you at the 90 percent level everything about it in terms of its physiology , life history , etc .
and the regular astronomers were scornful about this .
that will blow away a lot of the opposition .
you can imagine yourself being a mouse or fly inside of it , looking out of its camera .
now , the human part related to animals : look at the left side of that .
after her name , written in brackets was the apt description , horse face .
it &apos;s said to be the most successful ever invention of a word by a known individual .
and they basically said , &quot; &quot; look guys . we &apos;d like you to become netizen investigators . &quot; &quot; so 500 people applied , and four were selected to actually go and tour the facility in question , and thus inspect it and then blog about it .
that &apos;s not an option being considered too strongly .
still life on a rooftop , dead trees in barrels , a bench broken , dogs , excrement , sky .
her occupancy , her absolute , faithful attendance .
they &apos;ll tell you raheem really struggled , couldn &apos;t do two-digit multiplication — so great data , but you &apos;re getting it back after school is over .
my wife , yvonne , and i , we have four kids , three grown ones and a 15-year-old .
thank you for giving me the opportunity to share it with you .
now that doesn &apos;t sound like a lot , but it &apos;s very important , because being able to deliver the transition as a light sport aircraft makes it simpler for us to certify it , but it also makes it much easier for you to learn how to fly it .
you can clearly communicate your science without compromising the ideas .
so i think these are just a few keys that can help the rest of us to open that door and see the wonderland that is science and engineering .
and so , i am going to just throw in string theory here , and just say that creative people are multidimensional , and there are 11 levels , i think , of anxiety .
the man &apos;s sons were banished to live three kilometers away , in a cowshed .
( laughter ) our last day in portugal , we were in the district capital of faro , and catherine decided that she wanted to go to the beach one last time .
that &apos;s — that &apos;s not true .
the recipe to make those films is to take advantage of the fact that proteins are extremely smart at what they do .
i mentioned it briefly at the beginning ; the protein is biodegradable and biocompatible .
we were working on a fishing port .
the problem becomes : who gets what data when ?
if i come over here — ( laughs ) he &apos;s smart .
so i &apos;ll snap a picture .
mobisante is up in redmond , washington , and they kindly trained me to actually do this on myself .
and you just saw a little bit of the first two with my interaction with dr. batiuk .
they have this really remarkable facial expression technology that recognizes facial expressions , what facial expressions you &apos;re making .
as artificial intelligence evolves , so does his intelligence .
we identify excesses , bubbles .
what does it mean ?
when we painted the first building , by splashing a radiant orange on the somber gray of a facade , something unimaginable happened .
people started to drop less litter in the streets , for example , started to pay taxes , started to feel something they had forgotten , and beauty was acting as a guardsman where municipal police , or the state itself , were missing .
this is what happened last year when another security researcher called kyle lovett discovered a gaping hole in the design of certain wireless routers like you might have in your home or office .
as individuals or in groups , volunteers or military conflicts , there are hackers everywhere .
the pointillist movement is that kind of paintings where everything is broken down into dots and pixels .
( laughter ) but yeah , and it &apos;s great , you can even go , you know — or we have this pointillist movement for those of you who are into art .
but it &apos;s not enough to experience things ourselves .
let &apos;s go ahead and try this again with neuroscience in mind .
i &apos;m going to start today with nature , but before we do that , let &apos;s quickly listen to this snippet of an opera singer warming up .
perhaps you can hear it in the words i &apos;m speaking even now .
it &apos;s clear that when i was a child , i definitely walked through life like this .
your voice is small , but don &apos;t ever stop singing .
this next song is a song that started out as a dream — a childhood dream .
anyway , this is a song about : we have all this , but what are we going to do with it ?
i could have a perfectly good career in mainstream science .
it just has to follow safety guidelines .
and if you want an example of perseverance , grit and strength in a beautiful , little package , it is her .
it was time for me to go to cleveland and to start the agonizing wait for a match .
at google , 40 volunteers used a new software to map 120,000 kilometers of roads , 3,000 hospitals , logistics and relief points .
but help was coming .
we have our nucleic dna that everybody thinks of as our dna , but we also have dna in our mitochondria , which are the energy packets of the cell .
but these were created by scientists using both selective breeding and genetic technology .
and arguably it wasn &apos;t even solving much of a problem .
hard problems are hard .
so that was the theory , and we talked about it for a bit , we did a bunch of experiments , and then we said , let &apos;s really try to test it .
we &apos;re not looking to start a fund , but we want somebody else to do this .
hello .
this is a library in auckland .
dan holzman : please throw out the beanbag chairs . here we go .
bf : last night , michael moschen showed some juggling props he has invented and working on .
you guys know the show ?
the least you could expect is good tv , right ?
there &apos;s no touchscreen .
( applause )
this is derived from an organism , deinococcus radiodurans , that can take three million rads of radiation and not be killed .
within a short while , i think there &apos;s going to be a new field called &quot; &quot; combinatorial genomics , &quot; &quot; because with these new synthesis capabilities , these vast gene array repertoires and the homologous recombination , we think we can design a robot to make maybe a million different chromosomes a day .
this is what it looks like : the people have to tap them twice a day — just a millimeter slice — and the only thing you harvest is sugar water , carbon dioxide , rain fall and a little bit of sunshine .
this ecolodge that i built here , three years before , was an empty , yellow field .
this was done under local anesthesia , as an outpatient .
and we have a flexible , powered catheter with a special wire loop tip that stays inside the crunchy part of the marrow and follows the contours of the hip , as it moves around .
i &apos;ll take the 50 dollars now .
what i &apos;m saying is that , surely , rationally , our distress about things that happen , about threats , should be roughly proportional to the size of those threats and threats to come .
we look at the savings rate and it has been declining since the 1950s .
in particular , i &apos;m interested in the relationship to the future financial self .
what we can see here is the metal sheet , this time connected to a sound driver and being fed by a frequency generator .
and think about the immense sound of the universe forming .
ca : so how on earth did you get access to this drug ?
mr : right . that was myself as a male , the way i was brought up .
drugsheaven was offering excellent and consistent marijuana at a reasonable price .
so on purchasing my item , i would send my bitcoin to a neutral , secure third digital wallet .
a time for plotting to whack the chief of police , like in this classic scene from &quot; &quot; the godfather . &quot; &quot; coppola &apos;s script describes these guys as , &quot; &quot; exhausted in shirt sleeves .
or you can go to the random house website where there is this excerpt .
how far can we push them before they will reorientate themselves ?
and what we did then was put little boots on these legs , because this was a way to test if the legs were involved in sensing the temperature of the soil .
every night he was enjoying his work , he was staying late , he was perfecting this powerpoint presentation .
ignoring gets you a whole way out there .
and the object itself invited exploration interaction , consideration and touch .
this debuted at number two on the new york times best seller list .
and now he &apos;s going to do what darpa asked me for .
at the end of exactly one year we had a device with 14 degrees of freedom , all the sensors , all the microprocessors , all the stuff inside .
( laughter ) and there was no off switch , so it wasn &apos;t very good .
the eyeless sockets of the pack animals everywhere account for the myriads of ravens along the road .
the first one is very simple : experience bars measuring progress — something that &apos;s been talked about brilliantly by people like jesse schell earlier this year .
i &apos;m in awe of their power in terms of imagination , in terms of technology , in terms of concept .
and one night , all of a sudden , i looked at this and i saw it in a way that i hadn &apos;t really noticed it before .
this is a rather recent example of urban clarity that i just love , mainly because i &apos;m always late and i am always in a hurry .
i avoided every science class i ever could .
i looked at my husband , he looked at me , and then we looked at the doctor , and we said , &quot; &quot; als ?
and that &apos;s okay .
we respond to stories more than data .
so : is it really easy ?
plus , crispr has some off-target effects , a very small percentage , but they &apos;re still there .
my hobby had become a habit , and my habit gave me possibly the world &apos;s most eclectic netflix queue .
i received a poignant tweet .
i learned that success isn &apos;t a one-way street .
and the only thing that came was creative block .
these are shots my wife took a couple days after the quake , while i was making my way through the d.r. into the country .
the fellow in the door , andre filitrault — who &apos;s the director of the center for interdisciplinary earthquake engineering research at the university of buffalo — was examining it to see if it was safe to recover the archives .
i call this the staircase illusion , and actually when the staircase illusion abruptly ended , he froze , and this is called freezing of gait .
but the one thing that i always looked forward to was playing around with my cousins .
we emerge out of relationships , and we are deeply interpenetrated , one with another .
he wagged his tongue at the baby .
i worked on this for some 14 years , and i think it helped me become a better teacher .
it &apos;s a little different than it was in my day .
we &apos;re not all angry fanatics who want to kill the infidel .
( laughter ) and ideas du bon marche .
i spend a lot of my time thinking about how to spend my time .
we want to have a relationship with technology that gives us back choice about how we spend time with it , and we &apos;re going to need help from designers , because knowing this stuff doesn &apos;t help .
it &apos;s about critical thinking .
they asked citizens to write the content .
i think we can all agree that it &apos;s worth the trouble to do so .
( applause ) this includes not treating pregnant women like community property .
what we do is humanize the tissue .
so this motivated me to become an orthopedic surgeon and to see if i couldn &apos;t focus on solutions for those problems that would keep me playing sports and not limit me .
kb : this question has come to me a lot of times before , and i feel like the word &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; just comes to me and then drops , but there is one fear that i have that is different from that .
one day i went to the office and found our metal signboard wrinkled and broken as if a lot of people had been hitting it with something heavy .
and we kind of object at first , saying , &quot; &quot; oh , that &apos;s awful . &quot; &quot; but if we think about the dependency that we have on this other technology , called the alphabet , and writing , we &apos;re totally dependent on it , and it &apos;s transformed culture .
and if i want to go in to book a flight , i go into the airline &apos;s flight page , the website of the airline , and i &apos;m linking to that page .
( laughter ) so we decided that we needed a set of rules , and we came up with a number .
and my doctor , on a whim , sent me to get a full-body bone scan , which showed that there was some growth in my left leg .
the first few years of the web were pretty much video-free , for this reason : video files are huge ; the web couldn &apos;t handle them .
we opened up our talks to the world , and suddenly there are millions of people out there helping spread our speakers &apos; ideas , and thereby making it easier for us to recruit and motivate the next generation of speakers .
but the fishes , as i say , are the best known .
so it allows us to sample these amazing habitats that are very far from the surface and very far from light .
thank you very much .
i couldn &apos;t have done better .
so the problem we introduced to him was this : he &apos;s just moved house .
do you want milo to squash it ?
it &apos;s a problem like any other .
they were wonderful people .
to sell his idea , he became a showman .
tesla &apos;s insight was profound .
there &apos;s something much more interesting around the corner , &quot; &quot; i say , &quot; &quot; try saying that to her . &quot; &quot; that &apos;s what i say in my mind . and i just say &quot; &quot; thank you , &quot; &quot; and i go on to the next one .
firstly i &apos;m going to show you the transparency .
furthermore , it &apos;s simply not true that what went wrong in afghanistan is the light footprint .
we should have limited ourselves very , very strictly to the protection of the civilian population in benghazi .
so for example , we didn &apos;t have ways to have credit checks , few banks to collect bills , etc .
i flew around the world .
and this brings me , actually , probably , to the biggest implication , and this has huge implications beyond innovation .
so what we have to actually do is build these entrepreneurial state organizations .
for a small fee , they can upload it and make sure everything is good .
and it &apos;s kind of like she went into her social media settings and clicked on every option imaginable to make herself really , really insecure .
turns out we kind of do a reasonable job .
we can run these simulations .
you may remember that we were talking about a super-massive star that became a very strong magnetic field magnetar .
( applause ) listening to this gamma-ray burst that you &apos;re seeing on the — ( applause continues ) thank you .
but this is not going to work .
ten people brought 20 million people to a standstill , and this traveled around the world .
if the question of where to start seems overwhelming you are at the beginning , not the end of this adventure .
we the people have become inured to our own irrelevance when it comes to doing anything significant about anything that matters concerning governance , beyond waiting another four years .
now , who are they accountable to ?
it &apos;s important that we build this platform , that we have the president , kikwete , and others of our leaders who are saying , &quot; look , we must do something different . &quot;
we &apos;re just motivating people to pay attention and change their behavior .
but unfortunately , between here and here , most of that energy is lost to things like transmission leakage and heat .
generations go by , somebody says , hey , why don &apos;t we put it on a stick ?
i think we &apos;re going to have to have a major round of moral progress in the world .
voice 1 : it &apos;s coming again . new wave !
because when we think about blogs , i think for most of us who are concerned about them , we &apos;re primarily concerned with things like politics , technology , etc .
and it was such a good trompe l &apos;oeil that people got irritated when they tried to talk to the woman and she wouldn &apos;t respond .
and for the musicians .
but here &apos;s what &apos;s interesting : the lead undercover agent — you can see him in this picture with his face blurred — would go back to the tampa field office with his recording equipment on .
this isn &apos;t an outlier .
there will be insurance issues .
when i was asked to do this , i was also asked to look at all 14 ted talks that i had given , chronologically .
you love , or you don &apos;t love .
( laughter ) this , as you know , is an act of heresy .
so often , seven days a week . family business equals child labor .
and she has this show , &quot; &quot; the simple life . &quot; &quot; so i watched this . it &apos;s not very simple , a little bit confusing .
even my books on children have cute , fuzzy animals .
it &apos;s a children &apos;s book for the ipad .
this is a substantially large impact .
in an adult brain of course we &apos;ve built up a large repertoire of mastered skills and abilities that we can perform more or less automatically from memory , and that define us as acting , moving , thinking creatures .
archeologists will dig us up in a thousand years and they won &apos;t know about defensive medicine and stuff , but they &apos;ll see all these labels , &quot; &quot; contents are extremely hot . &quot; &quot; they &apos;ll think it was some kind of aphrodisiac .
because life is complex , and here is the hardest and biggest change : we have to restore the authority to judges and officials to interpret and apply the law .
the price of human beings across the last 4,000 years in today &apos;s money has averaged about 40,000 dollars .
slavery , illegal in every country has been pushed to the edges of our global society .
they took that video and they embedded it in their 404 page and it was like a light bulb went off for everybody in the place .
this is one that blames you .
we &apos;re looking for competence , discipline , endurance , and strength .
we move along the wall , in what &apos;s called proximity operations , looking for changes in color .
we have a much larger brain than our ape ancestors .
but will we do that , or will we just let nature take its course ?
and i will conclude by saying any understanding of human relationships must take into account one the most powerful determinants of human behavior : the unquenchable , adaptable and primordial human drive to love .
so , here on the internet you have three major ones .
but also we &apos;ve started to have debates about how the role of the private sector should move away from just being a profit motive and really be more engaged in the delivery of social programs .
do you see that happening ?
pcbs accumulate .
and bringing those two together might seem a very daunting task , but what i &apos;m going to try to say is that even in that complexity , there &apos;s some simple themes that i think , if we understand , we can really move forward .
the other point that &apos;s worth noticing is how one-dimensional this projection is .
and that the chinese won &apos;t catch up or pass the americans until somewhere in the latter part , after 2050 , of this century .
what values and principles did they imbibe with their mother &apos;s milk , were they taught in law school , do they use every day , do they believe with all their hearts — and we chose liberty and equality .
this is a long-term strategic litigation campaign . we shall .
music : dj shadow .
and so sometime soon , you &apos;ll be able to play and build and sketch with electronics in this fundamentally new way .
there &apos;s something about caves — a shadowy opening in a limestone cliff that draws you in .
it was created by these early artists in europe , between 10,000 and 40,000 years ago .
as you can see , sometimes a subspecies branches off .
( applause )
fifty years is not that much time to meet one of the greatest challenges our species will ever face .
it &apos;s as though we &apos;ve been handed an oracle that behaves exactly as intended .
and standing there , alone in the desert , it was not lost on me that the chance of any one individual entering the fossil record is vanishingly small .
here &apos;s a picture that i took in southern patagonia .
now , millions of abalone every year make this shell .
what &apos;s different is how the molecules are put together .
we &apos;re not trying to control polio .
and these vaccinators , these volunteers , they have got to dive headlong into some of the toughest , densest urban slums in the world .
if the ancient greeks had found out about seasons in australia , they could have easily varied their myth to predict that .
one is well known : untestable theories .
but i also became interested in research , and in particular i became interested in this substance , nitric oxide .
and of course , they were right .
we are the ones who draw that line between the sacred and the trivial .
they &apos;re trying to swim out , but their meat is cooking on the bone because it &apos;s so hot .
it &apos;s a small virus that kills bacteria .
but the only way we think that biology can have a major impact without further increasing the cost of food and limiting its availability is if we start with co2 as its feedstock , and so we &apos;re working with designing cells to go down this road .
they live in the depths of the congolese jungle , and it has been very difficult to study them .
first , it &apos;s a ball game bonobo-style — and i do not mean football .
so the fact that not only did cancer not seem to originate in skeletal muscles , but cancer didn &apos;t seem to go to skeletal muscle — there seemed to be something here .
but when the body is actually initiating a process and we &apos;re calling it a disease , it doesn &apos;t seem as though elimination is the right solution . so even to go from there , it &apos;s possible , although far-fetched , that in the future we could almost think of cancer being used as a therapy .
( loud ) i can get really excited by using volume .
( higher pitch ) where did you leave my keys ?
and i &apos;m going to say a few words about each one this morning .
how are these construals reflected in language ?
how was it that the gay rights movement was being pitted against the civil rights movement ?
and what guided me in making this film was , how was this happening ?
so you never know where curiosity-based research will lead , and someday you may want a swarm of cockroach-inspired robots to come at you .
( laughter ) thank you .
so , superman can fly .
as you can see , there &apos;s a bubble of air and it &apos;s bouncing around inside .
and i know it &apos;s a quirky example , but i think the implications of this are quite radical , because it suggests that we could actually transform a big problem — waste — into a massive opportunity .
firstly , radical increases in resource efficiency .
this stuff is really important . this stuff is really vital . &quot; &quot; this is people designing their own experiences .
you could , kind of , see them in your rear-view mirror , so it created a tiny human interaction .
my family &apos;s first tv set in 1948 had only three knobs that i quickly mastered : an on-off switch , a volume knob , and a channel selector knob .
still a third reason is our american cult of youth , which shows up even in our advertisements .
developmentally , these two conditions develop in exactly the same way . between late childhood and mid-adolescence , there &apos;s an improvement , in other words a reduction of errors , in both of these trials , in both of these conditions .
so for example , take risk-taking . we know that adolescents have a tendency to take risks . they do .
and that not only leads to a better set of clinical choices , but the doctor can also prescribe those resources for the patient , using health leads like any other sub-specialty referral .
i believe that at the end of the day when we measure our healthcare , it will not be by the diseases cured , but by the diseases prevented .
it really requires , at this point , people on the outside , and we &apos;re being radically open with this technology in which we &apos;re going to launch it out there for anybody and everybody who &apos;s interested to take it on and try to make it real .
so we would remove the algaes that concentrated in the bottom of this column , and then we could harvest that by a procedure where you float the algae to the surface and can skim it off with a net .
and he did the same for daggers , axes , spears , shields and every other form of weaponry .
the data is then sent on a cellular network to well-equipped hospitals hundreds of miles away for analysis .
here , i &apos;ll show it to you .
very useful word . so , look at that .
if you love your enemy that means you want your enemy to be happy .
and he &apos;s freaked out . and he won &apos;t even look left or right to see any encouraging vision .
people in the center , like me , started feeling helpless .
i will get more attention .
see again , the diversity .
so this is another project that i worked on with the sensible cities lab at mit .
and we found that this individual shared a common origin for his dna sequences with neanderthals around 640,000 years ago .
approximately one letter in a hundred will differ from a chimpanzee .
there are big ones . there are little ones .
so , next we see a picture here that shows you before this experiment the size to which we could confine the mass of the center of the galaxy .
or from your book group . or from your friends , or from the circle you want .
but it got me thinking about the fact that these guys , at least most of them , know what it is that they do for a living .
and she describes to me the feeling she felt as a five-year-old standing in that exact spot .
well you can see where this is going .
and then they wanted to make a fish farm and again the council said no .
they were like , well , maybe we can reuse those graves after 50 years .
if the cdc &apos;s current estimate , that one in 68 kids in america are on the spectrum , is correct , autistics are one of the largest minority groups in the world .
( applause )
i no longer want to get rid of your stress .
it &apos;s as much a part of your stress response as the adrenaline that makes your heart pound .
it usually begins here , and it grows and then it falls .
now , we &apos;ve all seen a lot of tedtalks online , so let &apos;s watch one now with the sound turned off and the closed captioning turned on .
you &apos;ll have no choice ; you &apos;ll buy my code .
i call this the sport utility principle .
what i &apos;m not suggesting is that microbial cellulose is going to be a replacement for cotton , leather or other textile materials .
and as it evaporates , it will knit itself together , forming seams .
but in the last year , where president sirleaf comes from , her village , we went there to work with these girls .
not only did the wish of a piece of doughnut come true , the wish of peace came true .
you pay by credit card or whatever , and then she will call you sometime in the next two years .
these people don &apos;t need the million dollars perhaps , but wouldn &apos;t you think they &apos;d like to take it just to make me look silly ?
but it is not an easy task .
and the impossibilities that had been imposed upon them by a disadvantaged community were replaced by hope and purpose .
and , above all , it &apos;s not going to be boring .
the center committee of the red brigades had judged me too single-minded and too opinionated to become a good terrorist .
that &apos;s why i broke all the professional rules of conduct for an economist , and i wrote an economics book that you could read on a beach .
just to give you one example : angola alone is getting 50 billion dollars a year in oil revenue .
biologists , on the other hand , have got off lightly , in my view .
but i believe it &apos;s built on solid science .
my mom and so many women like her have taught me that life is not about glory , or certainty , or security even .
it &apos;s about embracing the paradox .
if you talk in the right way , you make it very clear that talking is not agreeing .
and we have among states a reluctance in dealing with them .
and when they hollow out , then they become habitats for organisms .
if you send a thousand of them , you could probably get rid of 90 percent of them and still have a mission .
( space shuttle taking off ) chris hadfield : it is incredibly powerful to be on board one of these things .
it would make you nervous and worried .
he wanted to be a chef really badly .
from user name liquidsore29 — interesting user names we have here — &quot; disgusting liberal moms making their sons gay . &quot;
if art has any purpose , it is to open our eyes to that fact . &quot; &quot; thank you very much .
it isn &apos;t some cultic thing . ( laughter ) it &apos;s just , it &apos;s just , i just would like us all to go there .
with more data , the little bump will either turn into a nice , crisp nobel prize — ( laughter ) or the extra data will fill in the space around the bump and turn it into a nice , smooth line .
and the world ran with it anyway .
i have hundreds and thousands of stories of very very well-to-do families , and children from well-to-do families , who are getting trafficked .
all that we know that hundreds of men had used her brutally .
like a refugee . because he represents the u.n.
but , uh-oh , the killers are within the camps .
so one of the things that we pursued in bali was pieces of furniture .
so i &apos;m not sure if you saw your neighbor putting their hand up .
there &apos;s some bumps along the way , but the big story is you could practically fit a ruler to it .
but our brains are wired for a linear world .
suppose that two american friends are traveling together in italy .
it &apos;s based on more voluntary deference , and even elements of love , at times .
but he actually talks to , has two-way exchanges with , about four to six people on a regular base , depending on his gender .
companies blocking access to im or to facebook .
this whole outfit , including the jacket , cost me $ 55 , and it was the most expensive thing that i wore the entire week .
i was betting that i &apos;d be able to find everything else i could possible want to wear once i got here to palm springs .
but don &apos;t throw away your phones yet .
we need to continue mounting pressure on phone companies to change their sourcing processes .
so we &apos;re not empty vessels ; the mental models that we have as children persist into adulthood .
( applause )
but not just work . it &apos;s within these tribes that societies get built , that important things happen .
now , i want to tell you a quick story .
we don &apos;t necessarily always do it very well , but we have a sense of what the models are , politically and institutionally , to do that .
and in tunisia , censorship actually began to return in may — not nearly as extensively as under president ben ali .
thank you very much .
great .
what do you have that we don &apos;t have ?
the problem was getting caught .
in his fascinating account of the disaster , nathaniel philbrick wrote that these men were just about as far from land as it was possible to be anywhere on earth .
but just as importantly , we need to think of ourselves as the readers of our fears , and how we choose to read our fears can have a profound effect on our lives .
and you actually did inspire me . i looked at you , i thought , well , he &apos;s made it . maybe there is a different way .
( laughter ) and so , it &apos;s like , good news or bad news ?
( laughter ) and then came the summer after my freshman year , when my grandfather passed away due to cancer .
it was about finding my passion .
it is the largest ongoing humanitarian crisis in the world .
but today i want to tell you a different story .
and why ?
you can &apos;t breathe as well .
but we &apos;re going through the haystack no longer with a teaspoon but with a skip loader , because of this increase in speed .
that &apos;s a degree of an improvement that would look good on your report card , okay ?
so we &apos;re starting to pay for things with money that we have .
and you &apos;ve got to admit , over the course of the last year and a half , consumers have been doing some pretty weird things .
it must use a lot of power .
so then i thought about impact .
but there is really no longer any major debate over the fact that cooperative arrangements have moved from a peripheral role to a central role in biology , from the level of the cell to the level of the ecology .
what forms of suffering could be alleviated , what forms of wealth could be created if we knew a little bit more about cooperation ?
tk : okay , so i think about nine months later that you had the targeted reinnervation surgery , took six more months to have all the reinnervation .
but my favorite one was just when the hand was open , because i work with kids , and so all the time you &apos;re clapping and singing , so i was able to do that again , which was really good .
i also wasn &apos;t &quot; &quot; supposed to be &quot; &quot; an artist in the sense that i wasn &apos;t formally trained to do this — i &apos;m a math major actually .
so i wrapped the stop sign pole near my house .
so let &apos;s start off looking at something rather not-so-small , something that we can see with our naked eye , and that &apos;s a bee . so when you look at this bee , it &apos;s about this size here , it &apos;s about a centimeter .
if you take some heart cells from an animal , and put it in a dish , they &apos;ll just sit there and beat .
( laughter ) well in the netherlands , we have an innovative minister of agriculture , and she puts the insects on the menu in her restaurant in her ministry .
we could much better change from meat , from beef , to insects .
what can you do to help ?
they say that the everglades is our greatest test .
if we think , for example , of louis pasteur , who in the 1860s was asked to study the diseases of silk worms for the silk industry , and his discoveries were really the beginning of the germ theory of disease .
i didn &apos;t always love unintended consequences , but i &apos;ve really learned to appreciate them .
but in the same way that intersectionality raised our awareness to the way that black women live their lives , it also exposes the tragic circumstances under which african-american women die .
what you may not know is that the other list is also african-americans who have been killed within the last two years .
and i was thinking about this , of all places , on a transatlantic flight a couple of years ago , because i happened to be seated next to a hungarian physicist about my age and we were talking about what life was like during the cold war for physicists in hungary .
and the landscape was always made by this sort of weird , uneasy collaboration between nature and man .
( applause )
( laughter ) additionally , i &apos;ve heard horror stories from people whose teachers scolded them , of course , for doodling in classrooms .
is english a tsunami , washing away other languages ?
okay , religious mania : there &apos;s rapture , there &apos;s weeping , there &apos;s visions .
you know tom friedman says , &quot; &quot; if you don &apos;t go , you don &apos;t know &quot; &quot; ?
it is almost criminal that we are not investing more in energy research in this country .
we therefore conclude the universe is not a fluctuation . &quot; &quot; so that &apos;s good . the question is then what is the right answer ?
one big clue we have is that the universe is changing with time .
and i thought , in the beginning — i studied this bird for a couple of years — that , well , shouldn &apos;t the brain of this bird be damaged ?
( laughter ) but then something good happened .
so how are we going to figure out what this circuit does ?
so this mouse was blind a couple weeks before this experiment and received one dose of this photosensitive molecule in a virus .
and so now i do know at least some of the calculus that underlies all of that stuff .
the world is changed by our maps of the world .
we must go to watch &quot; &quot; afghan star . &quot; &quot; cynthia schneider : these programs are reaching incredibly deeply into society .
and in the last season there were two women in the finalists .
with the result we have very high productivity , very high quality at very , very low cost .
and then so , one had to constantly innovate .
given a couple of clues , i could probably find out a lot of things about most of you in the audience that you might not like me finding out .
but here &apos;s the thing . algorithms are rules . they &apos;re binary .
and the thing that &apos;s so spectacular about that to me is not just the ringing , though that is awesome .
but early on , when the universe was making that last afterglow , the gravitational waves put little twists in the structure of the light that we see .
well , let &apos;s think about the drug screening process for a moment .
they were developed in japan pretty recently .
like , it &apos;s very easy for me to let my mind loose because i don &apos;t try and fit myself into a tiny little box .
what does it mean ?
we print geometry where we can make industrial design objects like , you know , shoes , leather belts , handbags , etc . , where no sentient creature is harmed .
and we do something different than what we did in the past ; we add kind of a modicum of intelligence to that .
and so we got invited back this past summer , and we actually moved into the hamptons , payed 3,500 dollars a week for a house , and we learned how to surf .
we can do something here .
so what is the air ?
maybe it &apos;s impossible , and maybe it doesn &apos;t matter .
even quantum mechanics can give you an excuse for bad housework , for instance .
who knows , maybe one of your atoms was once napoleon &apos;s knee .
thirty billion dollars , that &apos;s larger than the entire bilateral aid budget going to africa per year .
and it can be done .
environmental and health crises are global .
&quot; &quot; wintris is coming , &quot; &quot; he used to say .
we need to see deep trenches , the undersea mountains , and understand life in the deep sea .
and fortunately , in our time , we &apos;ve learned more about the problems than in all preceding history .
when something becomes ultra-low cost , it becomes massively scalable .
i mean , just think how long it takes a child to learn to speak .
it &apos;s not only transparent to light but it &apos;s permeable to oxygen .
okay , just like the movies .
so if you think , oh , it &apos;s all happened before , we &apos;ve seen the results in the past of when new things come along and they get replaced by new jobs , what are these new jobs going to be ?
so from this vantage point , i was able to find out a lot about what machine learning can do in the past , can do today , and what it could do in the future .
and , most importantly , there &apos;s a partnership between those perceived deficiencies and our greatest creative ability .
by not treating the wholeness of a person , by not acknowledging their potency , we are creating another ill on top of whatever natural struggle they might have .
on the side facing the street it &apos;s much more normal , except i slipped a few mansards down , so that coming on the point , these housing units made a gesture to the corner .
it &apos;s made of metal and the brown stuff is fin-ply — it &apos;s that formed lumber from finland .
and , in fact , we &apos;re very lucky in this region .
and it occurs everywhere — you know , why bother ?
( laughter ) and when the bill was signed by the president , making it into law , it was a plus .
malawi is one of the poorest countries , very poor , where gender equality is questionable .
to combine engineering and design and ...
fn : and i also had an interest in dangerous inventions .
so , traffic keeps flowing , so that means less braking , which means less accelerating , less gas and less pollution , less time wasted , and that partly accounts for europe &apos;s better efficiency than we have in the united states .
stop signs were invented in 1915 , yield signs in 1950 . but that &apos;s all we got .
once again , they &apos;re useful members of society .
but what about how they behaved ? that &apos;s what he wanted to know .
finally , when your girl is , let &apos;s say , on her bike on the top of the steep hill that she insists she &apos;s too scared to go down , guide her to access her bravery .
she didn &apos;t know it then , but researchers have a name for this .
please , allow me just two minutes .
and every part can be transformed ; every frog can be transformed in a prince .
nothingness is special . it &apos;s the simplest .
and god created , indeed , out of nothing at all .
and this suggests it doesn &apos;t matter who tries this toy , the toy is broken .
things are going wrong for him .
so let &apos;s talk about the perpetual search trap .
so if we take a long-term perspective , we explore .
we &apos;re almost done .
all due to mutant genes .
i don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve noticed , but there &apos;s been a spate of books that have come out lately contemplating or speculating on the cognition and emotional life of dogs .
so this afternoon , in my limited time , i wanted to take the guesswork out of a lot of that by introducing you to two dogs , both of whom have taken the command &quot; &quot; speak &quot; &quot; quite literally .
i began my college experience just after my family had fallen apart .
( applause )
tr : thanks for the interaction on a high level there .
let me tell you what they are . first one : certainty .
and we even text at funerals .
and then there &apos;s technology — simpler , hopeful , optimistic , ever-young .
so let me share some final thoughts .
i might have ended up spending most of my life on the back ward of a hospital , but that isn &apos;t how my life turned out .
now it seems simple , but actually i think in our society and culture in general , we have a huge problem with intent .
what was going on then ?
do you know who sponsored this research ?
it dulls thinking and blocks creativity .
free even light feels kind of like , ah , i can breathe in free .
you know ? it &apos;s all these one-on-one meetings for like four days .
but today , i want us to step back and ask a more fundamental question , and ask , &quot; &quot; what happens if we &apos;re thinking about this maybe in the wrong context ? &quot; &quot; we do a lot of studying of those who are sick and building up long lists of altered components .
what are our genes ? &quot; &quot; and looking within ourselves for information we used to say we should go to the outside , to experts , and to be willing to share that with others .
each of those people in turn has advisers who advise them , so they can advise the president .
bbm : thank you .
and balancing them all in the middle is this notion of compassion , which has to be there , if you like , at our very roots .
this &quot; &quot; 18 minutes &quot; &quot; business , i find quite fascinating .
now she had them look at them and do this ... laborious , which i thought for a long time , until she explained to me was to slow them down so they &apos;ll think .
so the roslings have been able to do simplicity without removing what &apos;s important about the data .
this is nepal and tibet .
this map can be updated , and we can add in new data .
are there any failures that you can talk about ?
ca : so , in vaccines and polio and so forth , you &apos;ve had some amazing successes .
yet , rabin referred to iran as a geostrategic friend .
a third of the jewish population stayed in babylonia .
the infrastructure enables that .
we &apos;ve also shared other sorts of entertainment — sports arenas , public parks , concert halls , libraries , universities .
what does that look like ?
ten thousand times over a period of a year .
we have used our brains to fashion ever more amazing technologies .
it &apos;s absurd .
biologically , that shouldn &apos;t even be possible .
should we ?
it &apos;s absolutely heartbreaking to see .
redwoods have an enormous surface area that extends upward into space because they have a propensity to do something called reiteration .
it &apos;s not about the things that it brings .
why should we get away from those arguments ?
and by the way , all those precautions to keep the norden bombsight out of the hands of the nazis ?
so what happens during the second world war ?
tell your daughters of this year , how we woke needing coffee but discovered instead cadavers strewn about our morning papers , waterlogged facsimiles of our sisters , spouses , small children .
say to your baby of this year when she asks , as she certainly should , tell her it was too late coming .
not just a few astronauts — thousands of people are going to colonize mars .
his name is elon musk , he &apos;s the ceo of tesla motors and spacex .
it was cabinets of processors and storage and everything .
you can also see that his visual cortex is activated in the back of the head , because that &apos;s where he &apos;s seeing , he &apos;s seeing his own brain .
robbie mizzone : thank you .
( applause ) we call ourselves the sleepy man banjo boys .
pick up another marker out of the cup and color in the ox for me . color in the ox .
how is this possible ? well , could it be that gwen &apos;s brain is so wired to solve that she decoded hidden messages ?
my first slogan is : if you &apos;re going to lead , lead .
the results ?
then there &apos;s all kinds of other applications . implanted medical devices , where people don &apos;t have to die of infections anymore if you can seal the thing up .
it &apos;s odd . it has a battery .
or a person who fits in badly .
and at the end of the reading , katharine kidde of kidde , hoyt &amp; picard literary agency , walked straight up to me and shook my hand and offered me representation , like , on the spot .
a few years later , i was invited to be the director of the museum , and after i got over that — &quot; &quot; who , me ? the tapestry geek ? i don &apos;t wear a tie ! &quot; &quot; — i realized the fact : i believe passionately in that curated museum experience .
we thought very hard about how to present this unknown subject to a modern audience : the dark colors to set off the colors that remained in objects that were often faded ; the placing of lights to bring out the silk and the gold thread ; the labeling .
up in the left-hand corner is jobana , sintia and bertha .
after she shared her story , one of her friends said , &quot; i went through the exact same thing with my son about a year ago . &quot;
he said , if mae west can be m-a-e , why can &apos;t keshava be k-a-e ?
i like to think — thank you .
it does not have to be that way .
that is a public act of making media .
in every country , every program , you need a symbol , and this is probably the best thing he &apos;s ever done with his mba .
seven children per family — tremendous growth at 3.3 percent .
thank you .
the seeds give an oil , a very stable oil which is sought after by the cosmetic industry to give to produce body lotions , for example .
yes , that &apos;s us , with the greatest income inequality and the greatest social problems , according to those metrics .
but i &apos;m pleading for recognition that with increased wealth and profits has to come greater corporate social responsibility .
but you &apos;ll notice that in the upper bar , which is the lower atmosphere and the surface , it cools down because we shielded the atmosphere a little bit .
what &apos;s unusual about this one , maybe , is that it &apos;s from 1953 .
we had fantastic friends and we saw the wonders of the world , like kilimanjaro , serengeti and the olduvai gorge .
the standard explanation is that the universe somehow sprang into existence , full of a strange kind of energy — inflationary energy — which blew it up .
cl : now i &apos;m not suggesting that the cat is hearing that trumpet the way we &apos;re hearing it .
but it &apos;s really restoration of the ability to perceive beauty where we can get inspiring .
i met mr. ayers in 2008 , two years ago , at walt disney concert hall .
and he was talking about invisible demons and smoke , and how someone was poisoning him in his sleep .
and the first time i figured out that way was in this little single-person submersible called deep rover .
so why would a single-celled alga need to be able to produce light ?
thank you very much .
that , i think , is movement .
&#91; science for the public good &#93; previously , it was believed that scientific knowledge ought to be used for the good of the king or queen , or for one &apos;s own personal gain .
and i &apos;m going to tell you today about four major changes to science these men made .
these are just drawings of rome . i get back as often as possible — i need to .
and i thought , that &apos;s sort of interesting , but maybe there &apos;s a person who should be involved in this in some way .
and so , while lions are roaming the campsite , the fbi is chasing mice .
so we knew again about this crisis .
people don &apos;t smoke as much dope , or visit prostitutes quite so frequently during a recession .
one thing that we do know that the internet is doing is the internet is assisting these guys .
and the rest is history .
we can browse the internet anonymously .
so cancer could be thought of as a strange , short-lived , self-destructive life form — an evolutionary dead end .
but not many people know that there actually is a real animal called the tasmanian devil , and it &apos;s the world &apos;s largest carnivorous marsupial .
here &apos;s what had to happen .
i &apos;m currently a ph.d. student at mit , and i absolutely understand the importance of detailed , specific scientific communication between experts , but not when we &apos;re trying to teach 13-year-olds .
because i saw her a few weeks before that — you could get paid . they used to pay you two cents per coat hanger .
go get some of that . and i learned that at a young age .
the r &amp; d piece — it &apos;s crazy how little it &apos;s funded .
what am i appealing to you to step forward and drive ?
she can go to airbnb to list her sofa bed , she can go to taskrabbit.com and say , &quot; &quot; i want to do local deliveries , &quot; &quot; and so on .
they &apos;re likely to be more expensive .
the survivors that do get through produce this world of crocodile-like creatures .
they found in this gap , in between , a very thin clay layer , and that clay layer — this very thin red layer here — is filled with iridium .
behavioral psychology tells us that we take action and make decisions based on our emotions above all else .
but i &apos;ve been drawing ever since i could hold a crayon , really .
fear was the only sane response , the only human response .
could muhammad have so radically changed his world without such faith , without the refusal to cede to the arrogance of closed-minded certainty ?
so now that you &apos;re all experts on protocells , we &apos;re going to play a game with these protocells .
it can sense its local environment and actually find resources in the environment to sustain itself .
and we need to train them right .
we have reached a moment from which can emerge a great society within one generation .
so 70 years on , there &apos;s been some research where cognitive psychologists have actually sussed out the extent to which , you know , l , m and b are more associated with shapes that look like this , and p , t and k are perhaps more associated with shapes like this .
like looking away if you look at it too long because it gets shy , or things like that .
but you have it in planets and asteroids .
i never deal with images .
one of the key qualities of all stories is that they &apos;re made to be shared .
edward de bono : stage magic relies almost wholly on the momentum error .
i wrote a reference card to act as documentation .
and in the fall of 1977 , i entered the mba program at harvard business school .
( applause )
ma : from some people .
this is a project we &apos;re working on right now with a very healthy deadline .
it &apos;s a book on culture , and , as you can see , culture is rapidly drifting around .
this is from soviet union . attractive .
sometimes under those hats there &apos;s a lot of joy and a lot of sorrow . &quot; &quot; and , actually , you get more appreciation for glamour when you realize what went into creating it .
we basically found out that you can use these smart biomaterials that you can actually use as a bridge .
why ? because we &apos;d rather take those cells which already know that those are the cell types you want .
how do you feel about accidents ?
this means that our bacteria were actually living off of phthalates .
but it has given birth to a new idea .
i kept my emotions on hold .
between that one there , and that one there , it changed a lot didn &apos;t it ?
and i think this idea of soul , as being at the heart of great cars , is very applicable . you all know it . you know a car when you &apos;ve seen it , with soul . you know how strong this is .
raise your hand . yeah ?
and in oklahoma city , we &apos;d never really been on lists before .
and it brings you into the presence of what &apos;s been called god , nirvana , rama , tao .
and ted introduced me to a whole new way of thinking and presenting ideas .
i milked cows every morning , and i had to milk the same cows every evening when i came home from school .
essentially , he said this : &quot; &quot; if you bet on god , and open yourself to his love , you lose nothing , even if you &apos;re wrong .
it will take all of you . &quot; &quot; these words , i hold onto all my life .
this is part of our collective narrative .
( applause ) while you &apos;re pushing the clock , there &apos;s a few rules to obey .
i &apos;ll give you three examples .
so i took one year off , and i went to this village science program .
and what you can do is just , if you give it a twirl , well they just keep going on .
we &apos;re all specialists now , even the primary care physicians .
we &apos;ve discovered 6,000 drugs that i &apos;m now licensed to prescribe .
i &apos;ll meet you at frigoris . no . i don &apos;t think so .
and , as you can see , they don &apos;t use their first names .
and this was another killer app — the very opposite of a killer , because it doubled , and then more than doubled , human life expectancy .
once you do that , your artillery becomes accurate .
also , we do it in order to share with other people .
thank you very much .
i was wondering how you and your colleagues welcome the news .
this number is bigger than any number in astronomy .
so , absent being able to anticipate the future , what we all do , as good parents , is try and prepare our kids for every possible kind of future , hoping that just one of our efforts will pay off .
but it is a very elusive one .
so , let &apos;s make it right in our own backyard .
because what can you do with that data ?
steve jurvetson : steve .
keith schacht : now be sure and take the two pieces apart .
she &apos;s had a whole series of abusive partners , and , tragically , one of her children has been taken into care by social services .
so i &apos;m telling you about ella because i think that relationships are the critical resource we have in solving some of these intractable problems .
and these are administrative documents .
so the solution is actually to take inspiration from another domain : speech recognition .
now if you use the right kind of atoms and you get them cold enough , something truly bizarre happens .
so as my friend was trying to explain that experiment , it seemed like the more he said , the less i understood .
take the photos , the portraits , upload it — i &apos;ll give you all the details — and i &apos;ll send you back your poster . join by groups and reveal things to the world .
( applause ) this image of three men wearing gas masks was taken in chernobyl originally , and i pasted it in southern italy , where the mafia sometimes bury the garbage under the ground .
and what they ’ re evolving towards is the union of these two big ideas , darwinism and relationalism .
and merging them together to make the final quantum theory of space and time and gravity , is the culmination of that , something that ’ s going on right now .
and i think one of the lessons of history is that even the deepest crises can be moments of opportunity .
education : six , seven , eight percent of the economy and growing .
leandro is an amazing guy in a slum in rio , and he created a recycling project in the slum .
we &apos;re talking about democratic cities in which 95 percent of people decided that it was not important to elect their leaders .
massive technological advance : took an incredibly deadly disease , made it solvable .
as a researcher , every once in a while you encounter something a little disconcerting .
and after you &apos;re gone , and your theory with you , we &apos;ll know that there &apos;s more to that train than just an icon .
they &apos;re designed to keep us safe , and we should take them seriously .
she , people like her , her ancestors , have not had the best experiences at the hands of doctors and the hospital or insurance companies .
this has been a long learning process for us .
and i &apos;m going to go through some of them .
okay , now why then is this curious reluctance and curious hostility to consciousness ?
sometimes it &apos;s an internal stimulant , from your body .
introverted women : 3.1 .
on the other hand , when we do tours of our lab at the biofrontiers institute , and we explain that we use robots and lasers to look at poop , it turns out that not everyone wants to know .
and we &apos;ve just over the last few years found out that the microbes in different parts of the body are amazingly different from one another .
so essentially , the shape of the building that you &apos;re born into is the shape of the structure which carries you to your ancestral resting place .
until the funeral ceremony , which can be held years after a person &apos;s physical death , the deceased is referred to as &quot; &quot; to makala , &quot; &quot; a sick person , or &quot; &quot; to mama , &quot; &quot; a person who is asleep , and they continue to be a member of the household .
and the problem of how to go about this is quite obvious .
again , you see a small increase for the oldest books in the old testament , and then it increases much more rapidly in the new books of the new testament .
as i sat with families whose children were at the end of their lives , i was acutely aware of our surroundings .
crystal strung beads and made jewelry for everybody in the house .
if that &apos;s the source of the epilepsy , we can attack that as well .
i &apos;m a tech ; i &apos;m into medical gadgetry , which is mostly high-tech stuff like mr. bono talked about .
he does not seem to be breathing .
( laughter ) so we &apos;re based in new york city .
the bear was a female .
a few days later , the scene was memorialized in a political cartoon back in washington .
it is a very geologically active body .
and yet another moon there — i don &apos;t even know which one it is . it &apos;s a very extensive atmosphere .
or when you overeat because your feelings are hurt , or whatever .
one-third of all drug overdoses in the u.s. — and that includes cocaine , heroin , alcohol , everything — one-third of drug overdoses are prescription medications .
here it is about 40 minutes later .
you can also see this in the ants just outside the nest entrance like these .
i &apos;m leaving america .
every time , they sent scouts to make sure no one attacked them .
it asked customers to purchase chocolate with the promise of good deeds towards loved ones .
they can collaborate with them on the creation of ideas , knowledge , content , designs and product .
later , we found this stealthy green fluorescent lizardfish .
this is the largest single monochromatic blue environment on our planet .
they squirt them at each other , which is lovely and innocent .
the reuse of syringes now exceeds that and kills 1.3 million people a year .
you really felt empowered ; you felt like you could make anything .
we &apos;ve built entire economies on this idea .
at the time , he was teaching classics at trinity college in dublin .
she died alone in 1940 in the company of her books and her dear friends .
perhaps some circular pieces of metal .
so for example the first text : there &apos;s a doubling of this jar-shaped sign .
right now there &apos;s a student who is coming up with a way to convince his mom or dad that he &apos;s very , very sick and can &apos;t make it to school tomorrow .
and that to me is sad .
it might have been a politician . it might have been a breakthrough .
and there was that same awkward silence from most of my classmates , until sitting next to me , one of my friends , one of the cool kids in class , steven , leaned across and punched me really hard in the head .
i hope you will enjoy .
well , no truncal ataxia , that &apos;s good.first doctor : you feeling light-headed or dizzy at all ?
so i classify the people into three : uneducated , little educated , surplus educated .
like that , i never chased mahalakshmi .
we see that they squat . they kneel in prayer .
the other thing we did is that we smoothed the profile .
this was the third trip .
the parents are still stuck inside .
and one renamed the months of the year including after himself and his mother .
luanda , it was full of land mine victims who were struggling to survive on the streets and war orphans living in sewers under the streets , and a tiny , very wealthy elite who gossiped about shopping trips to brazil and portugal .
there was this guy steve , the i.t. guy .
so as it turns out , for some reason , men who drink scotch reference kinky sex immediately .
we built our highway system in response to that .
they would have a small computer connected to the internet in their pocket .
i think we all know what it is that we want to hear about .
we clearly need to change it .
she &apos;s beaten .
they jump high . they wear red .
a boy who lost a leg to a leftover mine .
i began documenting the close connection between hiv / aids and tuberculosis .
and it &apos;s so simple .
if you look at the angles around the fold , you find that if you number the angles in a circle , all the even-numbered angles add up to a straight line , all the odd-numbered angles add up to a straight line .
turing &apos;s machine was entirely theoretical .
obviously , you &apos;ve got a computer now .
it &apos;s what i now have the privilege of saying to twentysomethings like emma every single day : thirty is not the new 20 , so claim your adulthood , get some identity capital , use your weak ties , pick your family .
don &apos;t be defined by what you didn &apos;t know or didn &apos;t do .
i &apos;m an ecologist , and i study complexity . i love complexity .
we &apos;re discovering in nature that simplicity often lies on the other side of complexity .
i &apos;ve had a lot of time to think .
today , i am so much more .
yeah , no , really , this was like aah — why didn &apos;t i remember this ?
and one of the other things i &apos;d been interested in and obsessed with over the years is spines and skeletons , having collected a couple of hundred .
he didn &apos;t want to play .
the auditorium was empty .
you just want to cling onto this .
i just look at the information , and knowledge , and experience that is lost due to natural causes of death in general , and aging , in particular .
we cannot get medicine to them reliably , they cannot get critical supplies , and they cannot get their goods to market in order to create a sustainable income .
i want to show you what one of those flights looks like .
and this is the brain region you used when you saw the pictures i showed you , or when you read romeo and juliet or when you tried to understand alan greenspan .
why does it seem to require these beings who sense things for us to operate ?
how does this work ? basically , i send people signals at random points throughout the day , and then i ask them a bunch of questions about their moment-to-moment experience at the instant just before the signal .
they collectively represent every one of 86 occupational categories and hail from over 80 countries .
i have an interest in education .
he didn &apos;t want to come to los angeles .
have you ever wondered what animals think and feel ?
now , maybe you say ok , well , those are different species .
and i hope to leave all of you here tonight with a strong sense of exactly why that dream is so absolutely within reach .
in fact , that &apos;s why more and more people are choosing to own guns .
and this is called the three-to-one positive emotion ratio .
that &apos;s all it takes .
and the coal companies just move on after the mountain was emptied , leaving even more unemployment in their wake .
but , like all of us , he had some problems .
dr. martin luther king , jr . , in a 1968 speech where he reflects upon the civil rights movement , states , &quot; &quot; in the end , we will remember not the words of our enemies but the silence of our friends . &quot; &quot; as a teacher , i &apos;ve internalized this message .
it must be so hard teaching those poor , unintelligent kids , &quot; &quot; i bit my lip , because apparently we needed her money more than my students needed their dignity .
an innovation is anything that is both new and useful .
this is about doing decision making in a way that you can actually combine even opposing ideas to reconfigure them in new combinations to produce a solution that is new and useful .
rg : the temperature of the heat shield can reach 2,600 degrees fahrenheit .
and that &apos;s what you see in the last rose bowl , you know , when we entered one of the floats .
for hundreds of dollars , i &apos;ve developed a system that exceeds the sensitivity of detectors that are hundreds of thousands of dollars .
i am 17 years old and i am a nuclear physicist , which may be a little hard to believe , but i am .
but it really opened my eyes to how much of my life i spent just secluding away , be it email or social posts or whatnot , even though it wasn &apos;t really — there &apos;s nothing really that important or that pressing .
it &apos;s been really important to make it comfortable .
i &apos;m just one sex worker on the stage today , but i &apos;m bringing a message from all over the world .
we &apos;ve had complicated experiences and complicated responses to those experiences .
we can ask a very concrete question .
so there is no neuron in my brain that is the same as another , and there is no neuron in my brain that is the same as in yours .
i &apos;ll give it to bill gates . ( laughter ) and my guy , who &apos;s my financial advisor in new york , he says , look , you &apos;re a silly guy because you would have 4.1 times more money today if you had made money with money instead of sharing as you go .
we have variations of this one question , from three onwards .
they were just influenced by the adults around them .
i &apos;m pretty sure when i was in jail , everyone saw titles in the international media something like this during these nine days i was in jail .
he didn &apos;t die .
the closer raisuddin got to the america he had coveted from afar , the more he realized there was another , equally real , america that was stingier with second chances .
but the arab spring has changed all that , in uprisings which have blossomed across the region since 2011 .
it &apos;s a social citadel ; it &apos;s an impregnable fortress which resists any assault , any alternative .
we have the ability to connect seemingly disparate threads to solve problems we &apos;ve never seen before .
it has to stand out from the crowd .
for them , there &apos;s no modern toilet .
for example , in kwazulu-natal province in south africa , they &apos;ve built tens of thousands of these pit latrines .
easter , of all pacific islands , has the least input of dust from asia restoring the fertility of its soils . but that &apos;s a factor that we didn &apos;t even appreciate until 1999 .
what did they say when they were cutting down the last palm tree ?
now some of the greatest composers , like bach , were combinations of these two things .
( music ) in the 10th century , little squiggles were used just to indicate the general shape of the tune .
by the very act of trying to reason us into your position , you &apos;re conceding reason &apos;s potency .
their essay would go viral , get translated into many languages , get debated at pubs and coffee houses and salons , and at dinner parties , and influence leaders , legislators , popular opinion .
so how could that ever happen ? &quot; &quot; and then i go , &quot; &quot; well , &quot; &quot; and then i put my margaret mead hat on .
mom , does the man just say , &apos; is now the time to take off my pants ? &apos; &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) and i said , &quot; &quot; yes . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) &quot; &quot; that is exactly right .
you can go to orcatech.org — it has nothing to do with whales , it &apos;s the oregon center for aging and technology — to see more about that .
but those subtle changes in your voice over a long period of time are hard for you or your spouse to notice until it becomes so extreme and your voice has become so quiet .
vermiculite was used to insulate lofts , huge amounts of it put under the roof to keep houses warm during the long montana winters .
but she was really amazed .
and i was dying . she was absolutely not giving me a thing .
everybody came . the butler passed around canapes .
but they were also — i was really impressed by how personalized they were , and how much work went into them .
on the outside it looks like a typical northeastern garage .
the two-gram carbon fiber cage around it prevents the propellers from entangling , but essentially the collision is absorbed and the robot responds to the collisions .
so this video illustrates the basic idea .
so we just started making a list .
( laughter ) so , it was in the course of these investigations that i ran into a map .
you see , we the people didn &apos;t want democracy .
that is more co2 than what the entire city of new york generates in one year .
i didn &apos;t tell her .
it doesn &apos;t surprise me that in this climate , many of our institutions for the provision of health care start to look a heck of a lot like jiffy lube .
and we &apos;re talking really small here .
the applications in a general sense could be anything that &apos;s anti-wetting .
we can analyze it .
so , this is the sound of four-thirds .
but there were daunting challenges .
it was true of aids .
( laughter ) and let me put the handkerchief over the solar cell .
this is why we can use a solar cell to charge our mobile phone .
some recent stories : nanobees zap tumors with real bee venom ; they &apos;re sending genes into the brain ; a robot they built that can crawl through the human body .
to take the top stories from the a.p. this last year , is this going to matter in a decade ?
on a business trip to florida in the early 1980s , bonica got a former student to drive him to the hyde park area in tampa .
he was a heel ; he was a hero .
and when i spoke with him , he told me , &quot; &quot; i know that i can &apos;t get those years back .
but at least now , whatever days that i have left on this earth , i can live them in peace . &quot; &quot; he also said , &quot; &quot; i hope that these younger veterans don &apos;t wait to get the help they need . &quot; &quot; and that &apos;s my hope , too .
you get damaged wiring .
and so we measured the size of the optic nerve using the scans with david miller three times — 12 months , six months , and before the infusion — and you can see the gently declining red line .
don &apos;t ask me why a man needs more than one wife .
oh yeah , i love those . ( laughter ) anyway , there was always an article about pleasure and relationships and , of course , sex .
and that institution is prison .
why are we offering only handcuffs , jail time and this fugitive existence ?
i became one of the working homeless .
i couldn &apos;t afford to find an apartment , or couldn &apos;t afford an apartment that would allow me to have the rottweiler and the cat .
some of the most amazing experiments , some of the most extreme experiments , are being done in antarctica .
and , among other things , they &apos;re looking for dark matter .
self-organization is why the aids virus is spreading so fast .
now , mathematicians thought this was very strange because as you shrink a ruler down , you measure a longer and longer length .
i told everyone : the police , my neighbors , my friends and family , total strangers , and i &apos;m here today because you all helped me .
why would anyone stay with a man who beats her ?
but what we &apos;re doing is just one group of institutions .
everything worked . great education .
some people think about a dark energy that changes with time , or whether the properties of the dark energy are different depending on where you look on the sky .
with the lsst , we get a completely new view of the skies above chile every three nights .
at some point , i couldn &apos;t bear the desecration of the river , such an important part of my city , and i decided to take action , especially after i heard that the city received a grant to divert sewage water and to treat it .
this is the river , covered , used as a trash yard .
and i &apos;ll also show you a simple example , from 23andme again .
and being the current day , of course , we started our own facebook group .
the first half will be performed by the live singers here on stage .
could we do this all in real time ?
regardless of religious belief or cultural background , there &apos;s a need for forgiveness .
he simply laid there , and as i looked into his eyes , i saw inner peace and acceptance .
at the end of this hole , we found a huge tunnel going right up the mountain underneath thousands of tons of glacier ice .
now this is brent mcgregor , my cave exploration partner .
so realizing the truth gave me a position to choose : should i continue to hate , or let it go ?
i never saw anybody to tell my story to them so they could advise me or do therapy .
we have just to finish the story .
come back . because , after , there is another trap .
mary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as snow , and everywhere that mary went , the lamb was sure to go .
so we use some clever image processing techniques to get a very accurate measurement of the color at each pixel in the video , and then the way the color changes over time , and then we amplify those changes .
so think about just a point to point movement .
if you &apos;re playing against a very good opponent , they may distribute it in that green area , which is the prior distribution , making it hard for you to return .
now my husband , chris , and i love this show .
but i think they &apos;re entering a new age , because technology makes sharing frictionless and fun .
next we can actually light them up with a laser . ( laughter ) now , this is a low powered laser , and we can actually pick up a wing-beat frequency .
this is malaria spreading across madagascar .
now , these suppliers were our big companies .
and in the first session , they all said , &quot; &quot; this is not bribery , what we are doing . &quot; &quot; this is customary there .
at the age of 19 , i was on the national leadership of this organization in the u.k.
the old mentality with a capital o , as represented by the nation-state , not yet fully into the age of behavior , not recognizing the power of transnational social movements , got left behind .
why this might be the case ?
when we actually looked at not just self-reported political orientation , but voting behavior , we were able to look geographically across the nation . what we found was that in regions in which people reported high levels of disgust sensitivity , mccain got more votes .
and you need to re-set it up .
and surgeons were tradesmen , rather than physicians .
( &quot; &quot; our heartfelt condolences to the families who lost their dearests in terror attack in bulgaria &quot; &quot; ) and it &apos;s going both ways .
they have graphic designers . what ? ( laughter ) crazy , crazy .
he knew that darkly pigmented peoples were found close to the equator ; lightly pigmented peoples , like himself , were found closer to the poles .
vitamin d deficiency creeps up on people , and causes all sorts of health problems to their bones , to their gradual decay of their immune systems , or loss of immune function , and probably some problems with their mood and health , their mental health .
this happens because typically tumors are areas where the immune system has no access , and so bacteria find these tumors and use them as a safe haven to grow and thrive .
we went on to show that this technology could sensitively and specifically detect liver cancer , one that is challenging to detect otherwise .
we steamed up the windows permanently , and every hour we had a different designer come in and write these things that they &apos;ve learned into the steam in the window .
this is a projection that can see the viewer as the viewer walks by .
the next obvious question to ask : what is the process of recovery ?
so , the child is given treatment . you &apos;ll see shots of the eye .
well , the first project i wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects by our lab .
just as an aside , i wanted to mention , cities are only two percent of the earth &apos;s crust , but they are 50 percent of the world &apos;s population .
these are people who have given one of their own kidneys to a complete stranger .
but remember that my main interest is not understanding why people don &apos;t care about others .
we had to do these for adults . so , we did succeed and we still do .
all right , for good measure , that &apos;s where nigeria is on the african map , and just there is the delta region that i &apos;m sure everybody &apos;s heard of .
when it comes to medicine , having that trust is a must , and when that trust is gone , then all that &apos;s left is fear .
&quot; but this is not what she wants , &quot; i said , &quot; and we have documents . &quot;
and my intention was to go out to the gyre , raise awareness about this issue and begin to pick up the plastic , chip it into little bits and cold mold it into bricks that could potentially be used as building materials in underdeveloped communities .
thank you . ( applause )
you can just see , underneath the car , there is a black rod on the floor by the wheel of the other car .
rolling a car over is another area where we use technology .
( applause )
so human history is viewed as sort of this downhill slide from the good old days .
and at the end , you get things like that .
this comes out . this comes out .
my students were the only ones spared from that fate .
i was spending all of my time with these young men .
and my friends from honduras asked me to say thank you , ted .
but the amazing thing about cities is they &apos;re worth so much more than it costs to build them .
and also , like facebook and google , they claim they are friends of the mouse , but sometimes we see them dating the cats .
so that &apos;s kind of a caoníma versus the héxiè , that &apos;s very good .
and there &apos;s artillery , and artillery are archers , but , more importantly , slingers .
giants are not as strong and powerful as they seem .
and the amazing thing to me is that you would think this woman would have excellent oral hygiene .
kinsey thought it was bunk , so he got to work .
how can we do that ?
access to these online networks has given young africans something we &apos;ve always had to violently take : a voice .
he says , &quot; &quot; i &apos;m a great golfer .
( audience : random . ) michael sandel : at random . you would do it by lottery .
snares on , snares off .
the tiniest , softest , softest sound to something that is so broad , so huge , so incredible ! there &apos;s always something — it may sound good up there , may not be so good there .
it was about 35 families that lived on this farm , and everything that we produced on this farm , we consumed .
around here , no ? the redwood forests are gone .
prosperity .
and then this avatar is sweeping up all of this data and enabling you to monetize it .
and i felt that i would have to actually go there and make some earthworks myself .
then i became an adult and started knowing who i was , and tried to maintain that persona — i became creative .
and he stayed in jail for eight months until his case came up for trial , at a cost to taxpayers of more than 9,000 dollars .
what we need in this space are strong data and analytics .
( laughter ) ca : preston , from your point of view , i mean , you invented this like 20 years ago , right ?
pr : we haven &apos;t prepared anything .
why haven &apos;t we done that ? why is that hard ?
the moon has moved in front of the sun .
by working to outcomes , people really have to test and bring data into the situation that one &apos;s dealing with .
and here &apos;s the opportunity .
that only seems authentic when i have stage fright , and the more nervous i was , the better the song would be . easy .
so on the week of my 30th birthday , i decided i was going to go to this local open mic , and put this fear behind me .
my problem with it is only its apparent anthropocentrism .
don &apos;t be fooled . there &apos;s nothing new about id .
i come at it as a professional observer of financial policy making and someone that wonders how history will judge us .
so here &apos;s an idea .
hi , everybody .
do you feel like you are all alone ?
my focus in recent years has kind of shifted more toward biology .
jh : is there a relief in playing with these forces ?
i want to end just by saying that there &apos;s enormous opportunity to make poverty history .
because we too often talk about them as these strong , huge masses of people yearning to be free , when in fact , it &apos;s quite an amazing story .
she always wears a headscarf , but i &apos;ve walked alongside with her on a beach with her long hair flying in the breeze .
liberia had been torn apart by civil strife for decades .
there were only three or four flights in 2003 .
well , first of all , what &apos;s going to happen next ?
al gore : finally , the positive alternative meshes with our economic challenge and our national security challenge .
but when they go away , so does much of the drinking water .
maybe it isn &apos;t a chemical problem . maybe it &apos;s a stem cell problem . &quot; &quot; in other words , he had two hypotheses .
we heard about the problems of unleashing growth .
if i take 30 steps linearly — one , two , three , four , five — i get to 30 .
and we will have plenty of computation as we go through the 21st century to do things like simulate regions of the human brain .
here , this gets right at the distinction between a disease-centered and a patient- or human-centered model of care , and here is where caring becomes a creative , generative , even playful act .
priorities change .
day four , well on the way to recovery .
the first patient to ever be treated with an antibiotic was a policeman in oxford .
they argued with my wife for me , and they read my son bedtime stories .
and , more than that , whatever is on your brain should come out of your mouth .
this is a sneak preview .
the third idea i want to share with you is that music , paradoxically , i think even more than words , is one of the very best ways we have of showing who we really are . i love giving talks , although strangely i feel more nervous giving talks than playing music .
this is the comparison of the toughness of the dragline spilk spun by 21 species of spiders .
so silk comes out of the spinnerets , and for those of us spider silk biologists , this is what we call the &quot; &quot; business end &quot; &quot; of the spider . ( laughter ) we spend long days ...
so i will do it quick , very quick , but in slow motion , so you can follow .
( audience : ten of diamonds . ) lg : pardon ? ( audience : ten of diamonds . )
i thought i could jazz it up a bit , have a little fun with it .
and they &apos;re always wrong , always hilariously , optimistically wrong .
but having considered it all , i &apos;m still going to vote the way i &apos;m going to vote .
you may have seen in on the front page of the new york times .
they had this kind of odd sort of fascination , like a car accident .
it &apos;s not an escapism that we feel particularly happy with today , however .
( laughter ) so the video won &apos;t show everything .
we &apos;ll act as though we don &apos;t know each other .
in 2013 , i chartered a helicopter with my cameras to document this aggressive dispossession .
mass media has omitted the fact that braddock is predominantly black .
it was at an event that we were doing on the subject at georgetown university in may of 2015 .
( applause )
she had been asked by one of the clients to go to the home of the client , because the client wanted to tell the mother and her brothers and sisters about her hiv status , and she was afraid to go by herself .
our mentor mothers get trained every single year and retrained .
so this is how it &apos;s passed from mother to son .
and over the past 35 years , i &apos;ve studied behavior on the basis of everything from genes through neurotransmitters , dopamine , things like that , all the way through circuit analysis .
then another character was a half-woman , half-cheetah — a little homage to my life as an athlete .
actually , i have them on stage with me : grapevines , magnolias — truly stunning .
unless we do something to prevent it , over the next 40 years we ’ re facing an epidemic of neurologic diseases on a global scale .
as far as protecting yourself against alzheimer ’ s disease , well , it turns out that fish oil has the effect of reducing your risk for alzheimer ’ s disease .
and we are in a long , long line of organisms to come to this planet and ask ourselves , &quot; how can we live here gracefully over the long haul ? &quot;
how can we do what life has learned to do ?
i &apos;m a potter , which seems like a fairly humble vocation .
so people started asking us , &quot; well , theaster , how are you going to go to scale ? &quot;
and this is just the beginning , you can create a social progress index for any state , region , city or municipality .
we live in a world where gdp is the benchmark of success in a global economy .
durga , the mother goddess , the fearless one , created by the pantheon of hindu gods .
overcome with the enormity of it all and the complete feeling of loss of control , i shed copious tears and asked my dear husband , jayant .
it felt as if my brain was trying to kill me , and then , being afraid of being afraid consumed all of my thoughts .
but research is sparse and there are no simple answers .
well , i was surprised . i did not know this .
and what happened next was that i entered this state of pure , unprejudiced amazement .
you &apos;re , like , a pro maker . &quot; &quot; okay , just wait for this one . this is good .
and then we came up with this idea to not just use electronics , but let &apos;s just smash computers with everyday objects and see how that goes over .
today , i would like to tell you a story , the story of a big change , and the story of the people who made this change possible .
so employing people , yes , but also we started programming projects of microfinance , education .
here it is , pulsing .
we also hear about the storehouse of biodiversity .
living conditions were quite spartan .
you &apos;ve heard that the average american spends 90 percent of their time indoors .
woman : we saw the men trying to push the soldiers , but none of them could do that .
news anchor : the clashes over the fence continue .
if you think about the problem of bananas versus chocolates , we think we &apos;re going to eat bananas next week .
i &apos;m going to talk about save more tomorrow .
why not buy his book ? tweet it . share it .
it might have happened while we were playing an instrument , or looking into the eyes of someone we &apos;ve known for a very long time .
and it isn &apos;t only depression in which these sex differences occur , but they occur across so many diseases .
and then , when i was eight and she was 60 , something changed .
the shield laws are our laws — pretty much a patchwork of state laws — that prevent a journalist from having to betray a source .
and you can see why , from ballmer &apos;s point of view , that &apos;s a bad idea , right ?
the problem is that , what begins as a tragedy in the third world could easily become a global problem .
for each patient , we will be able to do up to 100 different viral loads per patient .
and it did , thanks to a creative genius , a visionary and an awesome story .
the lion &apos;s share of the space goes to the winner &apos;s circle .
what are they going to do — sue you if you violate them ?
so you pick up the phone and you call .
another benefit of wi-fi , we learned yesterday about the benefits of wi-fi .
yossi vardi : this is one of the most popular viral advertisement of last year , known as the optical inch by philips . let &apos;s applaud philips — ( applause ) — for this gesture for humanity .
it is the program . it is the code of life .
they &apos;re easy to sequence : unlike a human , they , you know , have a thousand , two thousand genes ; we can figure out what they are .
( applause ) we want to get in as many songs as possible during our brief time here so this is the one to play .
i &apos;ve got a question for randi .
and think about some of the things that we &apos;re learning about cellular mechanics .
enjoy the rest of the show . thank you .
this is a dolphin that is self-aware .
okay , that &apos;s great , thank you .
and based on my prior sighted experience , it sounds like a pretty cool city , whether you &apos;re blind , whether you have a disability , or you haven &apos;t quite found yours yet .
its leash had been tied to the chair as her master went in for coffee , and she was just persistent in her efforts to greet me , perhaps get a scratch behind the ear .
walk the talk .
( applause )
now , i don &apos;t want to create the misimpression that china &apos;s hunky-dory , on the way to some kind of superpowerdom .
but before we get there , we &apos;re engaged in a struggle between good and evil .
i work with children with autism .
let me explain this in a little more detail .
the aircraft , while in flight , will communicate with technicians on the ground .
human creativity and innovation have always propelled us forward .
they were collecting them up , and handing them in to various places around the different towns for safekeeping .
within two weeks , i had 150 people wanting to join in .
( applause ) thank you so much .
i think a lot of you probably remember exactly where you were that morning .
they are bird-blending machines .
this drug has now been banned for veterinary use in india , and they have taken a stand .
and he never expected this .
i &apos;m like , i don &apos;t want to write this anymore .
what makes a strong female character is a character who has weaknesses , who has flaws , who is maybe not immediately likable , but eventually relatable .
i &apos;m not the first person to say this .
i go in their homes . and we do this worldwide , and we follow them around town with video cameras .
so why are these things so important in our lives ?
things are changing , but it will take time .
the challenge therefore becomes how to recruit effectively .
we set out to do this .
we worked hard to get all the permissions .
we know that microbes are dispersed around by people and by air .
but if you look across these space types , you can see that they &apos;re fundamentally different from one another .
i &apos;m 22 , and i &apos;m a left-handed pianist .
now in the old days , conducting , music making , was less about trust and more , frankly , about coercion .
there were no graphics routines . there were no mouse drivers .
ca : c &apos;mon , c &apos;mon . martial arts , games . c &apos;mon .
well , the answer is : through a three-headed device .
one day , i sat and thought , &quot; &quot; can we deliver anti-hiv directly within its reservoir sites , without the risk of drug dilution ? &quot; &quot; as a laser scientist , the answer was just before my eyes : lasers , of course .
94 percent !
i &apos;m here to talk to you today about a story that we have all been conditioned to believe is not possible .
and we support all of that with an intensive psychotherapy program to address the despondency , despair and depression that always accompanies severe , chronic pain .
please keep your seat .
and that , for me , are the important elements of precision public health : who , what , where and how .
now , i told you i trained as a cancer doctor .
i &apos;d looked at his eyes , and i saw his eyes looked at this bottle top .
it &apos;s a military surveillance robot , to go in ahead of troops — looking at caves , for instance .
and i think that second life and virtual worlds more generally represent the best we can do to achieve that right now .
you can &apos;t just turn to the people that are browsing digital cameras on the same page as you , and ask them , &quot; hey , have you seen one of these before ? because i &apos;m thinking about buying it . &quot;
and effectively we created what we like to call a theater machine .
now , something else happened .
they were the leaders , and we are the leaders of our community and the hope of our future generations .
when the war broke out — civil war — i saw how my mother was helping and how she really needed the help , and how the care is essential to the woman to be a woman doctor in somalia and help the women and children .
i can &apos;t do ui to save my life .
( applause )
so why is this important ?
so how have we been able to do this ?
of course , our elected representatives are not saying , &quot; &quot; yes , we &apos;re going to vote according to what citizens decide , &quot; &quot; but they &apos;re willing to try .
but , we also must admit that we haven &apos;t been good at using those same networks and technologies to successfully articulate an alternative to what we &apos;re seeing and find the consensus and build the alliances that are needed to make it happen .
and their love &#91; for studying &#93; was so big that i cried .
a land where every field hides a grave , where millions of people have been deported or killed in the 20th century .
what &apos;s needed really is a higher level of consciousness .
and we have one .
it turns out we were wrong on that .
i &apos;m going to fast-forward through a lot of lawsuits and a lot of community engagement .
this is when our institutions and our leaders are stuck in a paradigm that is rote and perfunctory , devoid of life , devoid of vision and devoid of soul .
it barely raises an eyebrow today when we learn that yet another person has decided to show his love of god by taking the lives of god &apos;s children .
and it &apos;s something that always drove all his choices .
editors and screenwriters have known this all along .
because remember , this is what drives the prosperity in the developing world in the villages and in the cities .
and if we can eventually get good solar in space , that also could help .
they &apos;re going to produce a version of this in somalia , because there &apos;s nothing in somalia at all .
but the people of the middle east have been deprived of any form of what we know as civic education .
now here &apos;s a conference in which people talk about the future , and you notice that the future is still at about the year 2000 .
and it all connects us together into something that is much bigger and much faster and able to evolve than what we were before .
i was tired of the vicious cycle , and i was tired of it even in the beloved agency in the department that i still love today .
it &apos;s led to coldness and callousness and dehumanized us .
india gave refuge to the jews , fleeing the destruction of the first temple by the babylonians , and said thereafter by the romans .
but people see a society for what it is , and that , it seems to me , is what ultimately will make a difference in today &apos;s information era , in today &apos;s ted age .
samuel pisar , an auschwitz survivor , said , and i &apos;ll quote him , &quot; &quot; the holocaust teaches us that nature , even in its cruelest moments , is benign in comparison with man , when he loses his moral compass and his reason . &quot; &quot; there &apos;s another kind of crucifixion .
and at last , we appear to be doing something about it .
and if we take just three of them — laparoscopic surgery , epidurals , and cranial drilling — these procedures account for over 30,000 complications every year in this country alone .
( applause )
and it &apos;s this gap between 96 and 91 that explains our politics of resignation .
so on may 1 , aka may day , we &apos;re going to try an experiment .
it could have lots of bacteria , it could have more than one virus , and it certainly has host genetic material .
the first thing you do as a scientist is , you make sure stuff works .
that first beep was usain bolt .
30 miles , 4,657 feet , a grand total of 883 feet farther than eddy merckx cycled more than four decades ago .
we developed a plan called &quot; &quot; the one degree war plan &quot; &quot; — so named because of the level of mobilization and focus required .
when we think about economic growth stopping , we go , &quot; &quot; that &apos;s not possible , &quot; &quot; because economic growth is so essential to our society that is is rarely questioned .
so i &apos;m surprised .
i have worked on this for over 14 years , and i can tell you , the results are very good .
we connect the dots in the supply chain .
and the thing about john d. is that he went into this chaotic wild-east of oil industry , and he rationalized it into a vertically integrated company , a multinational .
they have different electrical and magnetic properties .
i hope , within the next 10 minutes , to change the way you think about a lot of the stuff in your life .
so , what else could it be ?
well , move the blue one out of the way .
but no faces ?
so we have three pictures , potentially of the same person of the same age as leonardo at the time .
it shows the famous fountain of youth .
so , is this magic transferable to humans ?
serious mood .
what might possibly happen ?
so this also works for the house , for at home .
it was a huge bonding experience with the other members on the team , but it is difficult to sustain .
let it recover , before we start logging again .
secondly , we have a natural laboratory surrounding the earth .
we got to our campsite .
municipal waste , what we think of when we talk about garbage , accounts for three percent of the nation &apos;s waste stream .
i thought that things would be pretty fun and there would be more things to play with .
but i had a really striking experience once , when a group from afghanistan came to visit me , and we had a really interesting conversation .
that is , you have to decide what that other person expects of you .
well , you can &apos;t compare oranges to windshields .
( laughter ) give me your data .
take , for example , a major telecom company .
i &apos;m stylin &apos; , smilin &apos; , lookin &apos; real mean , because it ain &apos;t about being heard , just being seen .
i didn &apos;t know you actually have to have creative control .
it put a man on the moon .
i bring this to you to tell you that in 40 years , i &apos;ve gone from not being recognized as a human being to standing in front of the illustrious ted crowd today to talk to you about my views .
i just want to say good afternoon , good evening .
in the film , &quot; &quot; sometimes in april &quot; &quot; by raoul peck , idris elba is poised in a scene with his machete raised , and he &apos;s being forced by a crowd to chop up his best friend — fellow rwandan army officer , albeit a tutsi — played by fraser james .
and that &apos;s when i discovered comedy .
now as to what i mean by the best comedy and satire , i mean work that comes first and foremost from a place of honesty and integrity .
each of which was designed to trigger a different historical analogy : world war ii , vietnam , and the third was historically neutral .
now , synesthesia is the experience of a stimulus in once sense organ in another sense organ as well , such as colored hearing .
could be the neighbors , hotel room , your parents . sorry .
anatomically modern human beings have been around for about 200,000 years , so we &apos;re talking about five percent , at most , of our time as a modern , distinct species .
and the results of that are kids getting sick .
sit down and care .
and to do that , we tried to connect up the five towers into a single system .
so , examples like christopher wren &apos;s king &apos;s cross : you can see that the structural forces of the vaulting get articulated as lines , so you &apos;re really actually seeing the expression of structural force and form .
( laughter ) ( applause )
( music ) all right . there you go .
and so the very next lecture i gave in a conference , i talked about my science , and then i talked about the importance of the subjective and emotional aspects of doing science and how we should talk about them , and i looked at the audience , and they were cold .
they couldn &apos;t hear what i was saying in the context of a 10 back-to-back powerpoint presentation conference .
and at the same time to scrap inefficient old planes , so that if they were otherwise to come back in the air , they would waste more oil , and block the uptake of efficient , new planes .
and yet what we proved then is the u.s. has more market power than opec .
it was a bit of a road stopper , which was problematic because the police kept on trying to clear away the crowds , but huge fun — it was great for me to do a performance .
i was being asked and paid to do front covers .
( applause ) it was also very exciting results for us , i tell you .
so for that , we trained monkeys to perform a manual dexterity task .
so , welcome to oxford , ladies and gentlemen .
when i grew up , this was basically the media environment of my childhood as translated into food .
i don &apos;t need to say this , but vaccines are essential .
and the reason that i can say that is because we &apos;re now in an epidemic of fear like one i &apos;ve never seen and hope never to see again .
it &apos;s for motorola &apos;s new rugged cell phone , and yes , it really does say , &quot; slap mother nature in the face . &quot;
we slapped mother nature around and won , and we always win , because dominating nature is our destiny .
now , i don &apos;t even know what vintage the transmission is , but let me just show you very quickly some of it , and we &apos;ll move on .
repairman : ... not too far out . front poles , preferably .
i found out that it was a much more severe problem than i thought .
but it works for the private sector .
and these , to me , are the analogy for the car seats .
so , let me show you what happens .
you shoot a nuclear weapon at this thing , you have to blow it up within a few milliseconds of tolerance or else you &apos;ll just miss it .
now , a six-mile-wide rock is very large .
when you learn to read and write , it opens up opportunities for you to learn so many other things .
you can also code to interact with the physical world around you .
but it turns out , it doesn &apos;t remind me of the thing i thought it would ; it reminds me constantly of something else instead .
when other people see my tattoo , for the most part they like how it looks .
but i considered it a partial success , to be honest .
bg : thomas thwaites . tt : thanks .
i &apos;m sure i was trying to encourage myself to get out and explore london , but the message i missed was the need to start exploring and embracing myself .
but i was paralyzed by my fear of not being accepted .
and it turns out they are medical students on their way to a lecture about the latest suturing techniques , and he &apos;s the guy giving the lecture .
and you never think you &apos;re going to be the guy who &apos;s walking down the street and , because you choose to go down one side or the other , the rest of your life is changed forever .
we &apos;d take action . it may not be good action , but we would take action .
and when all of that data is held , they can do almost whatever they want with it .
you &apos;ve built simple tools for hunting .
now this turns out to be surprisingly common in the history of innovation .
i was there , too , with a film crew .
the guy on the left is named gilbert stuart .
and i think in many ways we can sort of think of the use of the blue nacre shell and the mayans as the first real application of the bluetooth technology .
and this is an approach that &apos;s used all over the world , including in our lab .
i &apos;m a very lucky person .
but at 15,000 feet , it &apos;s tough .
we have now deployed 30 different technologists in 18 different countries , and we have been able to connect millions of people in an effort to continue to learn what this particular segment of the market needs and demands .
where are we today ?
oh my ! there &apos;s so many of you .
so , i &apos;m very happy that you &apos;re , you know , doing this kind of thing , making the talks available online .
ms : yeah . ( mk : that &apos;s the challenge . ) when you look at the people you deal with ..
karen frank : we are a smaller brand .
we should stop looking outside .
now i &apos;m not talking here just about the bad companies — the &quot; &quot; abattoirs of the human soul , &quot; &quot; as i call them .
lab rats pluck themselves too .
but then , i fell in love , and i realized that they can , and actually trying to help my own dog overcome his panic and his anxiety , it just changed my life .
because using ammonia you get hugely high pressures if you heated them wrong .
this is a problem .
these linkages work both ways , and usually occur subconsciously .
they exact a toll in missed opportunities and unrealized potential , and they engender insecurity and distrust where you seek fulfillment and connection .
and all over europe , people stood up and said , &quot; we don &apos;t want this . &quot;
but it is not only about me .
in contrast , the security of android just really isn &apos;t as good .
we saw recently in the press that mark zuckerberg from facebook covers over his camera and does something with his headphone mic jack .
it was surprisingly non-innovative , moved very slowly , but then there was just so much fiber out there , you couldn &apos;t hold back , and look how quickly the price fell .
but the difference of a few years on stock-market valuations is obviously extreme . and that &apos;s why timing is everything .
actually , what happens in the world increasingly — now , all credit to the british airport authority .
because it does seem to me that large organizations including government , which is , of course , the largest organization of all , have actually become completely disconnected with what actually matters to people .
the most dramatic changes will be the skyscraper type of new pyramids that will take place in china and in many other countries .
and so a new awareness will have to arise , of how we deal with these , how we mobilize ourselves , in a new way , and come together as a community to manage systemic risk .
and indeed , neither can the katydids .
and what i think we &apos;ve done , is use males , in any species , as though they are the model system .
in this movie , you can see that the tumor is green .
we &apos;re focused on adding drugs , adding growth factors , killing nerves that are causing problems and not the surrounding tissue .
on twitter that night , we were like toddlers crawling towards a gun .
she was losing herself .
poems can help you say , help you show how you &apos;re feeling , but they can also introduce you to feelings , ways of being in the world , people , very much unlike you , maybe even people from long , long ago .
poetry helps me want to be alive , and i want to show you why by showing you how , how a couple of poems react to the fact that we &apos;re alive in one place at one time in one culture , and in another we won &apos;t be alive at all .
so i didn &apos;t think he was going to throw bart off .
that ship there , that &apos;s made from 24-karat gold .
those people don &apos;t need to be able to write beautifully by hand .
i &apos;ve tried this in many , many schools .
take the planet venus .
that &apos;s hot enough to melt lead .
it &apos;s pressure from the human population hunting and destroying their habitats which has done so .
but the opposite happened .
as faizan said at the time , if we bow down to the islamists , we &apos;ll just be sitting in a dark corner .
why is it that everyone knows who osama bin laden was and so few know of all of those standing up to the bin ladens in their own contexts .
i don &apos;t smoke cigarillos anymore .
but i listened for her check-ins every few minutes .
and actually other regimes , they told their citizens , &quot; &quot; would you like to see the situation of iraq ?
and then you have yemen .
and as you &apos;re thinking of the consequences of that , it &apos;s getting really hard to hide from this stuff , among other things , because it &apos;s not just the electronic tattoos , it &apos;s facial recognition that &apos;s getting really good .
here &apos;s andy &apos;s theory .
and , in fact , it didn &apos;t make any difference because i didn &apos;t have any patients anymore .
well , you know , in the middle &apos; 60s , the first antidepressants came out . tofranil was the first .
the universe is so big .
nothing worked .
for me , i was so moved by the response that came from the lunch ladies , because one woman said to me , she said , &quot; &quot; before this day , i felt like i was at the end of the planet at this school .
and she started telling me about her grandkids , and that blew my mind .
and this is , of course , not the first time you &apos;ve probably recognized this .
and over time , they did basically the same thing so the monkeys could learn , you know , who sold what at what price — you know , who was reliable , who wasn &apos;t , and so on .
do you trust elementary school teachers ? &quot; &quot; you would probably begin by saying , &quot; &quot; to do what ? &quot; &quot; and that would be a perfectly sensible response .
across the last few decades , we &apos;ve tried to construct systems of accountability for all sorts of institutions and professionals and officials and so on that will make it easier for us to judge their trustworthiness .
it was usually too hot , too stuffy or just too smelly , and my father would not let us use the air conditioner .
in the past , before air conditioning , we had thick walls .
finally , even for those who do manage to get the higher education , the doors of opportunity might not open .
so this format allows us to break away from the one-size-fits-all model of education , and allows students to follow a much more personalized curriculum .
unfortunately , violent action — though action is better than no action — but taking part in it only disguises violence .
hold on ! wait a minute !
i mean , think about how different cities are , actually .
well , think about it this way . who changed ?
and medical illustration is still art .
fear of anatomy and guts is a learned reaction .
and as we just heard earlier , of course , we &apos;re also learning how to put information on dumb objects .
people are saying that it &apos;s moving from the idea of the dream home to the dream neighborhood .
and shortly after the election and the outbreak of violence , the government suddenly imposed a significant media blackout .
kamen said , &quot; &quot; free cultures get what they celebrate . &quot; &quot; we &apos;ve got a choice before us .
now , how would you test a personal fudge factor ?
i was burned very badly .
nick berg &apos;s beheading quickly became one of the most searched for items on the internet .
in london , as late as the early 19th century , there might be four or five thousand people to see a standard hanging .
patrick never gave up his dream of higher education .
during the civil war , he and his family were forced to flee to nigeria .
that number , today , is now down to 17,000 .
gary haugen .
and what &apos;s interesting about it is the market was actually created by the gamers themselves .
i am just one of a new generation that is growing up .
so you have this 300-milligram robot jumping about eight centimeters in the air .
but ultimately we want to add everything onboard the robot .
thank you so much .
( spanish ) ( laughter ) so what happened in colombia ?
why is it that x is the unknown ? x is the unknown
now i know we learned that in math class , but now it &apos;s everywhere in the culture — the x prize , the x-files , project x , tedx .
and from a protected water source , water will be brought to an elevated water reservoir and piped to all households through three taps : one in the toilet , one in the shower , one in the kitchen , 24 hours a day .
we are fighting against this .
when i couldn &apos;t take it any longer , i ran out of the subway station and walked wherever i was going .
ten percent are in combat .
wikipedia reports that this guy , this former congressman from erie , pennsylvania was , at the age of 20 , one of the youngest people at the republican national convention , but it &apos;s just not true .
it &apos;s our real social lives themselves that are transmuted into art .
we can still make the pieces . we can make the right pieces .
so if you look , you can see a lot of different machines come out of this . they all move around .
but it &apos;s not only about the front page .
flipping through pages is readers experience , and i &apos;m responsible for this experience .
&quot; &quot; freedom ? it would have to be the rodeo .
finally , i did find a bull rider , two years ago .
we move forward , and we get wiped out — i mean , wiped out immediately .
we failed .
and it &apos;s where all the neighbors , they can go up and socialize , and do activities such as having a two-kilometer run in the morning , jumping from one building to another .
and third is that their image has nothing to do with africa and with ethiopia .
or two : you give 100,000 dollars to one savvy entrepreneur and help her set up a factory that yields 40 percent additional income to all 500 banana farmers and creates 50 additional jobs .
in response , the bretton woods institutions — the imf and the world bank — pushed for free trade not aid , yet the historical record shows little empirical evidence that free trade leads to economic growth .
we love the fact that the web is open .
in 2007 , seven years later , 17 percent .
it &apos;s used in paint for the texture , but also for the glossiness .
the low-tech bit is that it &apos;s literally a pig &apos;s heart valve mounted in the high-tech bit , which is a memory metal casing .
surely that makes it a price worth paying .
we won &apos;t be able to access our banks and we won &apos;t be able to access commerce without worrying about people monitoring those communications or subverting them for their own ends .
i am essentially a street photographer from 50 feet in the air , and every single thing you see in this photograph actually happened on this day .
i know it has for me .
they are not things to do with our bodies .
i really want to live in a world where disability is not the exception , but the norm .
jane mcgonigal told us last year that by the time a boy is 21 , he &apos;s played 10,000 hours of video games , most of that in isolation .
it turns out , from earliest childhood , boys , and then men , prefer the company of guys — physical company .
they want to spend less and save more .
we love new stuff — new material stuff for sure — but also new ideas , new adventures , new experiences .
and it &apos;s very difficult to be happy on a planet that &apos;s racked with famine and drought .
and i remember looking at these two versions of my obituary and thinking , &quot; &quot; oh boy , i &apos;m on totally the wrong track here .
dp : for one encore . ao : one encore , yes .
( audience : &quot; &quot; theme of paganini . &quot; &quot; ) ao : paganini . dp : &quot; &quot; the theme of paganini . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) ( music : &quot; &quot; theme of paganini &quot; &quot; ) ( applause ) ao : well done .
the sensor is just a little strip of metal in that headband there .
people were tracking their food via twitter , their kids &apos; diapers on their iphone .
he &apos;s making a , kind of , cheek-flapping sound .
we used a computer vision tracking system in order to know where they were .
i thought it &#91; would &#93; kind of be interesting to think back to that time when richard got the whole thing started . thank you very much , richard ; it &apos;s been a big , enjoyable part of my life , coming here .
and so then the object — the merchandise that you &apos;re interested in — can be scanned . it &apos;s taken into the dressing room , and in the dressing room there are scanners so that we know exactly what clothing you have in the dressing room .
with permission granted to record both before and after the operation , i set up my gear and captured a large number of dawn choruses to very strict protocol and calibrated recordings , because i wanted a really good baseline .
the good news is that , with a little bit of habitat restoration and fewer flights , the frog populations , once diminishing during the 1980s and early &apos; 90s , have pretty much returned to normal .
i began again .
we became his mouthpiece , spending hours each day reciting the alphabet as he whispered back sermons and poetry with blinks of his eye .
it was boring .
and pratham runs preschool play groups for , now , 21 million children in india .
for me , every day is a new thing .
fg : because i want to get a standing ovation like everybody , so ...
so this is great . it simplifies things .
in the cities cluster , one of the most central was one by mitch joachim about ecological cities , and in the genetics cluster , we have a talk about synthetic biology by craig venter .
there are some more stories i could tell you about my country .
( applause )
you know , but it doesn &apos;t listen to radiohead , does it ?
what schools are encouraged to do is to find out what kids can do across a very narrow spectrum of achievement .
i hope to arrive at new territories to discover sounds i have never heard before .
his music never ceases to sound fresh and surprising to me .
today , we see that same drive to beat cancer .
but we &apos;ve made essentially no progress at all in treating alzheimer &apos;s disease .
and it &apos;s time , it really is time , to debunk the myth that a country has to choose between development on the one hand and environmental protection , renewables , quality of life , on the other .
and you might be thinking that it was good luck , but it wasn &apos;t .
but we &apos;re not using it . it &apos;s just sitting there .
finally , we need to be presented with a clear point of action .
and it was done in europe .
it was like something out of caligula .
what is striking about this is that there &apos;s actually often quite a lot of overlap between their list and the list that we are considering for words of the year , and this is because we &apos;re noticing the same thing .
( laughter ) you can put your belt back on , put your computer back in your bag .
this is not about getting credit .
now , usually , when international audiences hear about that part of the world , they often just want that conflict to go away .
we had observers watch videos of teachers in the classroom and rate how they did on a range of practices .
what would that system look like ?
but i will in the end urge you to rethink , actually take risks , and get involved in what i see as a global evolution of democracy .
how do you reconcile that ?
and this japanese macaque has made a snowball , and he or she &apos;s going to roll down a hill .
nothing lights up the brain like play .
this reduced their fuel consumption by about 30 percent , which saved them money , and at the same time , it had a significant benefit for whales .
and this orange line here marks the typical songs of east coast humpbacks .
how could it be possible that we would do this ?
are we at some kind of evolutionary equipoise as a species ?
and in order to do that , i need to talk about mice a little bit .
but it is not part of metabolism itself .
and i understood that documentary photography has the ability to interpret events from their point of view .
they not only recorded history — they helped change the course of history .
we live in a time right now where in spite of globalization or perhaps because of globalization , all citizenship is ever more resonantly , powerfully local .
i invite you to literally share the narratives that you create on our facebook page for citizen university .
we also take words for cool things like &quot; &quot; ninja , &quot; &quot; right ?
( laughter ) we do this all the time in english : words like &quot; &quot; heartbroken , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bookworm , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sandcastle &quot; &quot; all are compounds .
it will be better for all if they prepare before entering office rather than learning on the job .
humanity is now fully into the techno-scientific age .
thank you .
now , i &apos;m an architect , and for the past year and a half i &apos;ve been looking at these changes and at what they mean for architecture related to death and dying .
alexander , a young macedonian , met there what he called a &quot; &quot; gymnosophist , &quot; &quot; which means &quot; &quot; the naked , wise man . &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t know who he was .
yours is illogical .
this openness , this forcing openness , is key , and if it wasn &apos;t entirely transparent already , i should be open : i &apos;ve got a completely transparent agenda .
all together , they achieved these results : increased the number of people on anti-retrovirals , life-saving anti-aids drugs ; nearly halved deaths from malaria ; vaccinated so many that 5.4 million lives will be saved .
it &apos;s an incredibly rich set of data that we have about cities now , maybe even richer than any data set that we &apos;ve ever had before .
( applause )
i couldn &apos;t keep watching my oldest son make bad choices without being able to be there for him when and if he needed me .
but deep down , i knew that the right decision was to go home , even if i didn &apos;t fully recognize the woman who was making that choice .
we &apos;re also sensitive to the shape of objects we have in &#91; our &#93; hands .
and for us humans , it &apos;s not quite material , it &apos;s not really there — it &apos;s virtual .
this is what the diy and maker movements really look like .
if anything changes — if the environment changes , the ground moves , or demand changes — we have to start from scratch and take them out and replace them .
so as you can see , lying is really a typical part of development .
and using this technology , i can not only find out what &apos;s going on in their lives but also simultaneously monitor their heart rate , their stress level , their mood and whether or not they are experiencing pain .
rights management is no longer simply a question of ownership , it &apos;s a complex web of relationships and a critical part of our cultural landscape .
and the scale and the speed of this system is truly breathtaking .
now i spoke to one of these carders who we &apos;ll call redbrigade — although that wasn &apos;t even his proper nickname — but i promised i wouldn &apos;t reveal who he was .
now he developed his social and moral compass on the black sea port during the 1990s .
your picture then i guess of how the world eventually gets off fossil fuels is through innovation ultimately , that we &apos;ll someday make solar and nuclear cost competitive ?
and i say , that is your problem .
but still , 6.9 million is 19,000 children dying every day .
according to one estimate , the gates foundation has already saved 5.8 million lives and many millions more , people , getting diseases that would have made them very sick , even if eventually they survived .
so , let me go through what you gain when you look at the world this way , besides some entertaining insights about human desire .
and within four or five weeks , he can do it again .
and they will look back at all of us as the generation who first found the earth-like worlds .
here is earth as a pale blue dot .
so you know , when you stick this idea ... ( laughter ) where would we expect me , robin chase , to be thinking is imagine if we put a mesh-network device in every single car across america .
and the other remarkable thing is it &apos;s , i think , the highest status of car ownership .
point directly at his forehead .
tell me when i &apos;m over a cup .
and here we see three stages of development that it went through in 30 years .
africans of antiquity created civilization , and their monuments , which still stand today , are a true testimony of their greatness .
and by virtue of being technologies , they &apos;re manipulable .
in fact , the trend was for disengagement with the rest of the world .
they had muscle weakness , stiffness in the neck and back , fevers — all of the same symptoms i had when i first got diagnosed .
i meditated on that pain , contemplating how my mind could have possibly generated all this .
in a filmclub season about democracy and government , we screened &quot; &quot; mr. smith goes to washington . &quot; &quot; made in 1939 , the film is older than most of our members &apos; grandparents .
some of our kids started talking with their parents , others with their teachers , or with their friends .
something totally new has been created here out of parodying something on television .
these three characters brought an authentic vision from multiple perspectives .
( applause ) dh : so since we started this project , we &apos;ve been getting hundreds of letters , emails , phone calls from people from all around the world .
so these two devices , drivegrip and speedstrip , are very effective .
you select one set of cells to perform one sort of behavior , another neuromodulator , another set of cells , a different pattern , and you can imagine you could extrapolate to a very , very complicated system .
and it &apos;s a beautifully complex neuron .
and i thought , why can &apos;t we do that today ?
cr : it &apos;s a balloon . lp : yeah , get access to the internet .
on top of that , the extracellular matrix is responsible for all wound healing , so if you imagine cutting the body , you actually have to rebuild this very complex ecm in order to get it to form again , and a scar , in fact , is actually poorly formed extracellular matrix .
now , all of these parts of the forest are made up of different plants , and different animals call them home .
one the best examples of this came in game four of the 2015 finals .
during games he would often ask , &quot; what are you seeing that i &apos;m missing ? &quot;
he also appealed to hope .
and , most important , they need to learn to respect learning .
nicole paris : tedyouth , make some noise !
but because i don &apos;t have electricity coming out of me , we had to emulate what the beats was doing .
you were separated from your family and placed into mother and baby homes .
&quot; i mustn &apos;t love you , &quot; i said to them . &quot; but i will ask god for forgiveness . &quot;
in august 2008 , uae public officials noted that 40 percent of the country &apos;s 1,098 labor camps had violated minimum health and fire safety regulations .
mainly indian , pakistani , sri lankan and nepalese , these laborers risk everything to make money for their families back home .
all blinking together in stunning synchrony .
now , for many of you , i know that fireflies might conjure up some really great memories : childhood , summertime , even other ted talks .
because when we mix them , we can get a voice that &apos;s as clear as our surrogate talker — that &apos;s the person we borrowed the filter from — and is similar in identity to our target talker .
and i looked around and i saw this happening all around me , literally hundreds of individuals using a handful of voices , voices that didn &apos;t fit their bodies or their personalities .
on the way there it &apos;s going to completely revolutionize medicine and health care ; that &apos;s obvious .
( applause )
a thousand years ago , you would have had to have walked to the village next door to see a building .
so all of a sudden , everybody wants one of these buildings : l.a. , seattle , chicago , new york , cleveland , springfield .
( laughter ) unlike the one-way entertainment of the 20th century , this community participation is how we become a part of the phenomenon — either by spreading it or by doing something new with it .
because that &apos;s what you do when your name is yosemite mountain bear .
no ceo , no firm responsible , singly , for building it .
my name is jonathan zittrain , and in my recent work i &apos;ve been a bit of a pessimist .
you can help to smuggle this civilian body count into government archives .
it &apos;s actually part of an ongoing art project .
we need to better understand how people make decisions in times of crisis , and why .
and around the world , satellites and warning systems are saving lives in flood-prone areas such as bangladesh .
this is your place , you stay here . &quot; &quot; and indeed , the police came — because they ’ ll just arrest us and put us in jail and release us whenever they feel like , after the 20th or so .
so as part of organizing this and whatever , this commemoration , the police will round us up as they call us leaders .
and look , as economical in data as a sans serif .
the question is , does a constraint force a compromise ?
i mean , there are those films that people are making for quality , but the first thing you have to remember about this society is that africa still has people that live on one dollar a day , and these are the people that really watch these films .
what does that translate to in terms of numbers of films , really ?
that &apos;s about 6,000 meters .
you have no limitations , basically .
it turns out that human drivers make mistakes that lead to traffic accidents about once every 100,000 miles in america .
later that year , he took it out for the first public test drive , and — true story — crashed into a wall .
he was the one who believed in me and encouraged me to do an adaptation of my books into a film , and to write , direct , and produce the film myself .
no one had done that kind of movie in quebec before because it &apos;s expensive , it &apos;s set in the future , and it &apos;s got tons of visual effects , and it &apos;s shot on green screen .
and in arabic , to say &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; we say &quot; &quot; no , and a thousand times no . &quot; &quot; so i decided to look for a thousand different noes .
the curator had only one condition : i had to use the arabic script for my artwork .
and i certainly didn &apos;t even want to be a writer , particularly .
the greeks believed that weeping together created a bond between people .
it is unimaginable what will happen next .
this was faster , and nobody had to try to read my handwriting .
( laughter ) now the really strange thing is life goes kaput , not once , not twice , but five times .
well it &apos;s not completely inconceivable that someday you &apos;ll be able to download your own memories , maybe into a new body .
it is , in fact , this that could become the framework for producing new social and economic justice in the city .
they were lucky , they said , because they began to dig under an arm of the freeway that belongs to the local municipality .
so if we wanted to build cities for another billion people , they would be dots like this .
it poses a very fascinating puzzle for us .
because the father — one of the fathers of the industrial revolution , adam smith — was convinced that human beings were by their very natures lazy , and wouldn &apos;t do anything unless you made it worth their while , and the way you made it worth their while was by incentivizing , by giving them rewards .
science creates ways of understanding .
needless to list them here , and there are more competent people to talk about this .
it &apos;s a systematic and scientific approach , which takes you to places that are remote , hot , hostile and often with no access .
it was beautiful .
so i asked , &quot; &quot; what do you think we should do about this ?
we have the southern right whale that we see here and the north atlantic right whale that we see here with a mom and calf off the coast of florida .
and that &apos;s because it &apos;s been protected , that it has come back .
now , to see the bias clearly , you need to understand what introversion is .
so i prepared for moments like these as best i could .
so you wonder , what if cities could give to their pedestrians what we take for granted as we now go between cities ?
we &apos;ve got to start building cities and human environments where a 150-pound person can go a couple of miles in a dense , rich , green-space environment , without being in a 4,000-pound machine to do it .
let &apos;s use the market as the best listening device we have , and understand at what price people would pay for this , so they get the dignity of choice .
it &apos;s a 40-year-old company , it understands manufacturing .
a very powerful message appachan : i watch the world wake up every day .
innovation by her when she was in class 10th : a washing machine-cum-exercising machine .
what we found is that in very remote areas , these droughts are having a big negative impact on tropical forests .
for example , how much and where to use fire as a management tool ?
and so i &apos;d feel a lot better about the whole thing if we could somehow show that an everyday object also follows quantum mechanics .
this is a photograph of the object .
it &apos;s like this very fast , very efficient way to get people off the street .
but i said we can &apos;t get rid of it , because all the people who tried to transplant heart valves found out you can &apos;t get rid of that immunity .
it &apos;s yes , sir ; no , sir ; no excuse , sir . &quot; &quot; &quot; you didn &apos;t shave . &quot; &quot; but sir — &quot; &quot; &quot; no , don &apos;t tell me how often you scraped your face this morning .
but i gotta have my hot dog .
the current will turn on and off at random , even when it &apos;s supposed to be on .
when kareem moves his head to the right , you will see this blue activity there ; it represents regions where the contrast is increasing in the image , that &apos;s where it &apos;s going from dark to light .
most of the information that we collected on the cholera outbreak didn &apos;t come from testing water ; it came from forms like this , which documented all the people we failed to help .
countless lives have been saved by canaries in coalmines — a simple and invaluable way for miners to know whether they &apos;re safe .
for example , recently a group of activists in uganda released a crate of pigs in the streets .
most people associate this type of action with gandhi and martin luther king .
you &apos;ve got to get your chemical into every puddle , every birdbath , every tree trunk .
other estimates put that number at roughly double that number of infections .
therefore , it would be too risky to release these animals , both for the released and for the natural populations .
they train their flying , they learn how to recognize the food they will find in nature , and they are able to socialize with others from the same species .
to me , that &apos;s the essence of journalism and that &apos;s what i &apos;m committed to doing .
but equally essential to what it means to be a free and fulfilled human being is to have a place that we can go and be free of the judgmental eyes of other people .
and , in fact , this idea can be used not just to predict epidemics of germs , but also to predict epidemics of all sorts of kinds .
you might see that people occupy different locations within the network .
so rick and liz and kevin and i came up with the idea .
and also the complexity and length of time they really take to do .
however , after five decades of research , there &apos;s no strong consensus on the definition , the cause , the treatment , or even the existence of pms .
what i &apos;m saying is that getting some of these symptoms doesn &apos;t amount to a mental disorder , and when psychologists come up with a disorder that &apos;s so vaguely defined , the label eventually becomes meaningless .
voting matters because it is a self-fulfilling act of belief .
why bother ?
over 200 brand-new books were sent to my room piece by piece .
i think we &apos;ve got it all wrong .
i mean , all the media that we watch — television , cinema — they &apos;re these windows into these other worlds .
and it can change people &apos;s perception of each other .
so in 10 , 12 generations , you &apos;re going to have thousands of offspring , and millions of offspring .
( laughter ) it &apos;s in all seven continents , including antarctica .
now , social dance is about community and connection ; if you knew the steps , it meant you belonged to a group .
the present always contains the past .
thank you . ( applause )
they cram them onto cots , put all your personal belongings in a plastic garbage bag , stick it underneath , and put you on the floor of an entire sports arena , or a gymnasium .
( applause )
make them easy enough to use and widely accessible , like the c.t. scanner we saw in china .
at least that &apos;s what it says on my pen . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) some of you are in the field , i can see .
( beatboxing ) ( laughter ) ( applause ) but as far as being a performer , i &apos;m also diagnosed bipolar .
transitional is completely different .
there are 98 oil-producing nations in the world .
the other day , i was reading something , and the person said probably the largest single cause of disease is handshaking in the west .
and there &apos;s one solution that &apos;s probably only a few years off .
children are especially sensitive to this repeated stress activation , because their brains and bodies are just developing .
sixty-seven percent of the population had at least one ace , and 12.6 percent , one in eight , had four or more aces .
five years later , they &apos;re struggling with serious terror attacks and rampant isis recruitment .
it &apos;s also because democratic governments are increasingly cracking down on dissenters , whistle-blowers and investigative journalists .
pandora &apos;s tim westergren knows this better than most .
i was one too .
we then got to the last ancestor .
and so what we have here is a description of single cells replicating , metabolizing , burning through chemistries .
and the only way to do this , because it &apos;s illegal , is to have absolute control of the geographic corridors that are used to transport drugs .
thank you .
i used to carry a big gun .
this misinformation destroyed the credibility of the source , and it &apos;s harmed the credibility of other reliable and trustworthy sources .
it &apos;s just about , i want to create some great experiences .
( applause ) and there &apos;s a couple of other things .
( applause )
how many tens of thousands of years does it go back ?
we &apos;re not asking meaningful metrics .
he tells me that he can always count on vivian and the staff there to make him feel at home .
but it gets strange , because even at that slice of reality that we call home , we &apos;re not seeing most of the action that &apos;s going on .
we live in a world of information now , and there is a difference between accessing big data and experiencing it .
thank you .
like , why did i really have to mow the lawn ?
the important point is that we will have started a process that is out of humanity &apos;s control .
there is evidence that feedbacks are already beginning .
the government won &apos;t say who is imprisoned here .
when a cmu prisoner has a visit , the rest of the prison is on lockdown .
and when i met him , he was a kind gentle old man .
this is all their movies . we &apos;ve got about 60 movies that these kids have made , and they &apos;re quite incredible .
and they do interesting things .
they &apos;re playing to discover what the technology can do , and probably to discover what they can do themselves , what their own capabilities are .
and oddly , the most notable letter of rejection i ever received came from walt disney world , a seemingly innocuous site .
and i found one section amongst all of these that actually resembled the outline of the united states of america , which you can see here .
yeah , it &apos;s just a fluke . it &apos;s a lancet fluke .
pretty scary .
when we focus on ourselves in any activity , we do turn that part of ourselves off if there &apos;s another person .
right now , as bill mcdonough has pointed out , the objects that we buy and use have hidden consequences .
perhaps one solution could be to introduce technology to students through creative projects .
thank you .
( laughter ) i saw an aston martin this morning .
ca : that was an utterly , utterly fascinating talk .
thank you .
and this is detrimental to the local ecology of the sea area that it &apos;s pumped back out into .
beam me up , scotty .
we can print drugs at point of need .
it was a long film to work on . ( laughter ) now , &quot; &quot; hugo &quot; &quot; was another interesting movie , because the movie itself is about film illusions .
so basically , if there &apos;s two subs in the same shot , i shot it , because where &apos;s the camera coming from ?
these three quads are cooperatively carrying a sky net .
we now have an intimate way of interacting with a machine .
for example , can you imagine that decent , civic , talented people are going to run for office if they really do believe that politics is also about managing mistrust ?
now we have the reverse tendency .
you know , i can eat a fish . i can &apos;t eat a crow .
( laughter ) and that is , they had barely left , and there wasn &apos;t a trace in the sand .
but really , truly — often you think about letting go way before your body does .
fear really sucks because what it means is you &apos;re not focusing on what you &apos;re doing .
and the food obviously went off very quickly .
these are extraordinary landscapes , but few of us ever get to see them .
( laughter ) okay ? there we are slogging through the wetlands , and i &apos;m panting and sweating , got mud up to my knees , and miguel &apos;s calmly conducting a biology lecture .
it turns out , miguel spent the better part of his career in the mikumi national park in africa .
the majority of it is in the higher altitudes , above 300 feet , where we don &apos;t have a technology as yet to get there .
and i think we need to support all of the dreams of the kids out there doing these crazy things .
now i spent a lot of time in my garage , over the next weeks and months , and also in my kitchen — much to the dismay of my wife . ( laughter ) however , after a few failed prototypes , i finally came up with this , the lifesaver bottle .
( sniffs ) ( coughs ) have a smell of that , mister cameraman .
they matched , they found his myspace .
and within 24 hours , it had over 12,000 responses .
( laughter ) nk : did you hear that , really ?
man : architect ? i &apos;ve heard about him ; he &apos;s a top-ranking architect .
so this came from leaks of tens of thousands of dispatches that were written by american soldiers about the afghan war , and leaked , and then they &apos;re able to do this investigation .
it &apos;s really difficult . so we &apos;re still having to rely on illegitimate ways of getting information , through leaks .
we opened the lid , we took the horse out , and it did work ; it walked and it was able to be ridden .
and it &apos;s very , very simple because all that happens is that the puppeteer breathes with his knees .
now we &apos;re talking scale .
all of the scale goes to coca-cola and burger king .
( laughter ) our reality right now is less interesting than the story we &apos;re going to tell about it later .
apologies to hans rosling — he said anything that &apos;s not using real stats is a lie — but the big delta there is how we deal with this from a public standpoint .
and it was something called ecorock .
you probably had no idea . it &apos;s like driving around the world six times .
so what then distinguishes the israeli / palestinian conflict from that in northern ireland , or the civil war in sudan from that in liberia ?
second , an international diplomatic effort that was hampered from the beginning by western support for kosovo &apos;s independence .
but there are a few hurdles , and they are quite basic and quite fundamental .
just completely independent entity , completely random occurrence , and the image , when i saw it , it really struck me .
and maybe that &apos;s true .
and this opens up completely new kinds of risks to us all .
i wanted to find out times .
ss : that &apos;s aimee mullins .
i would take him breakfast in bed , and then , in an old track suit and slippers , he would go for a walk around the garden .
i grew up amongst those animals .
they want to focus on long-term economic stability and growth .
or , absent crisis , we need to see that the hollowing out , the inequality , the challenges that are growing and growing in the united states , are themselves urgent enough to force our leaders to change , and that we have those voices .
now , this wouldn &apos;t be an exact replica , because the short dna fragments that i told you about will prevent us from building the exact structure , but it would make something that looked and felt very much like a woolly mammoth did .
so if we were to go deep now within the bones and the teeth that actually survived the fossilization process , the dna which was once intact , tightly wrapped around histone proteins , is now under attack by the bacteria that lived symbiotically with the mammoth for years during its lifetime .
you will have seen something like this — this is the reverse effect .
so , show the original picture for 240 milliseconds . blank .
so my suspicion was that it might have something to do with the amount of noise they make .
in 2010 , there was a ted event called mission blue held aboard the lindblad explorer in the galapagos as part of the fulfillment of sylvia earle &apos;s ted wish .
and you see how the dark matter lumps up , and the ordinary matter just trails along behind .
so if you take a picture of what &apos;s going on , it &apos;s 10 years ago .
and then he analyzed the data .
let &apos;s see if they congregate around certain ideas .
thank you .
it is beautiful , and it has long been a part of our history .
he says to me , &quot; &quot; we &apos;ve done some work around the country .
these kids have attitudes that you just can &apos;t believe .
i watched her hands as she bathed an old man .
( applause ) if compassion is so good for us , why don &apos;t we train our health care providers in compassion so that they can do what they &apos;re supposed to do , which is to really transform suffering ?
we feasted and reveled and rutted in muck , forgetting our peril , forgetting to duck , forgetting times arrows are sharper than knives .
looks like a much prettier version of margaret thatcher , ( laughter ) but without any of the soft bits in margaret &apos;s character . ( laughter )
now , in ethiopia , we &apos;re in the process of designing the first organized ethiopia commodity exchange .
the great indian economist , amartya sen , was awarded the nobel prize for demonstrating that famine is not so much about the availability of food supply , but rather the ability to acquire or entitle oneself to that food through the market .
how do we do that ?
this was repeated on lots of different individuals with lots of different images , always with a similar result .
is there a chance you &apos;ll see her there ? &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) but scott &apos;s journey remains unfinished .
if you cannot understand that there is something in man which responds to the challenge of this mountain and goes out to meet it , that the struggle is the struggle of life itself upward and forever upward , then you won &apos;t see why we go .
( laughter ) never have we been observed in such detail while building an art installation .
it &apos;s a vicious circle .
that is an unknown part of them , and we shouldn &apos;t behave as though it is known .
but let &apos;s accept the strangeness of some of our ideas .
this is bret adee opening one of his 72,000 beehives .
in other words , we have to understand bees up close .
thank you .
now close your eyes .
and it &apos;s not just the view of social scientists .
one of the very first questions asked me to check a box for my race : white , black , asian , or native american .
so we have the programs and the sporting events and the commercials , and all of the link structures that tie them together make a content graph .
of course , my son is learning from his linguistic environment , but the environment is learning from him .
so i can pile things up , i can flip through it , i can , you know — okay , let &apos;s move this photo to the back , let &apos;s delete this guy here , and i think it &apos;s just a much more rich kind of way of interacting with your information .
hit me .
if you remove the beginning and the end , you &apos;re left with a beautifully worded descriptor that tries to , in just a few words , capture an achievement or a lifetime .
my wife understandably thinks i &apos;m rather morbid to begin my day with scrambled eggs and a &quot; &quot; let &apos;s see who died today . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) but if you think about it , the front page of the newspaper is usually bad news , and cues man &apos;s failures .
and this is where medical imaging comes in .
and then you &apos;ll see a few other hot spots , and these are in fact the tumors .
medullary tissue is the calcium build-up , the calcium storage basically , when an animal is pregnant , when a bird is pregnant .
that &apos;s how people make glofish .
now , what have kids done ?
it &apos;s the reason we &apos;re not in the dark ages anymore .
so what you see here is this is the design of the task .
everything that we ever do , everything that every human has ever done , do or will do , requires the toil of populations of neurons producing these kinds of storms .
but look at the scale of the differences .
and that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to show you .
for the past five years , i &apos;ve been researching , working with biologists and traveling all over the world to find continuously living organisms that are 2,000 years old and older .
this is clonal colony of quaking aspen trees , living in utah , that is literally 80,000 years old .
we agreed we &apos;d speak up in our own communities when we witnessed the kind of &quot; &quot; otherizing &quot; &quot; talk that can wound and fester into paranoia and then be used by those on the fringes to incite .
so , looking for answers , i went to catholic mass .
if this research is successful , it may then reduce the need to research and sacrifice human embryos .
earlier that week , i had taken a rather hard knock during late spring skiing — yes , i fell .
particularly in the world of sea ice , the rate of natural change is outstripping predictions of just a few years ago , and the processes either are accelerating or the predictions were too low to begin with .
is it getting hotter or is it getting colder ?
and then you see a date .
but it was amazing to see that he was also executed on march 29 , 1984 .
and if you have enough energy and heating , which our sun does , that gas , which is so light and only bound by gravity , it can escape into space .
and these planets can be called hot jupiters , for some of the ones we &apos;ve found .
and my grandfather , he was a wise man , and he saw that as a problem , because he knew that was , like , the one thing i had . i didn &apos;t play sports .
well , i eventually got to the rhode island school of design .
he said , &quot; &quot; the explorers of 2012 , if there is anything left to explore , will no doubt carry pocket wireless telephones fitted with wireless telescopes . &quot; &quot; well , orde-lees guessed wrong by about eight years . this is my pocket wireless telephone , iridium satellite phone .
( laughter ) i skied on for a week past the pole .
and what happens next ?
and i asked them to do a project together , tackle the issues affecting their country in cartoons , yes , in cartoons .
and what do they do with that money ?
if it becomes clear to them that they cannot recover any money , they become less interested in pursuing the case .
first , ultrasound : we &apos;re very familiar with it from physical therapy ; it &apos;s also now being used to treat cancer .
the hindus say , &quot; &quot; nada brahma , &quot; &quot; one translation of which is , &quot; &quot; the world is sound . &quot; &quot; and in a way , that &apos;s true , because everything is vibrating .
those guys are measuring influence , not behaviors that indicate our trustworthiness .
you know , there are only a few windows in history where the opportunity exists to reinvent part of how our socioeconomic system works .
there &apos;s a staggering array of wonders out there , across diverse disciplines , all telling us the same thing : success can be ours if we &apos;re willing to try .
now , there &apos;s an enormous variety of tiny , inexpensive sensors on the market , and you can easily imagine someone putting together a phone that could measure temperature , co2 or methane levels , the presence of some biotoxins — potentially , in a few years , maybe even h5n1 avian flu virus .
where i come from , we call it delhi belly , as a legacy of empire .
but she wasn &apos;t alone that day , because 4,000 other children died of diarrhea , and they do every day .
this is an idea that we got from a fellow tedster here , dan dennett , who talked about taking the intentional stance .
what do you see in this particular one here , in this field ?
it turns out that living in the midst of conflict is really bad for our health .
just like the millennials in that recent survey , many of our men when they were starting out as young adults really believed that fame and wealth and high achievement were what they needed to go after to have a good life .
for some reason , i thought it would be a good idea to put an intermission in my talk .
impossible ? i don &apos;t think so .
a major fortune 500 furniture maker uses these corner blocks to protect their tables in shipment .
and i want you to really watch closely these little white dots on the screen , because , over the five-day period , what they do is extend out and through this material , using the energy that &apos;s contained in these seed husks to build this chitinous polymer matrix .
whatever comes , there was this hour when nothing mattered , all was unbearably dear .
feats of such modest valor , who would suspect them to be exercises in an intimate , fierce discipline , a metaphysics of being relentlessly aware ?
i believe that the way forward is to learn to manage success .
the fifth thing is that we didn &apos;t invest enough in infrastructure .
such a discovery might have saved steve titus , the man whose whole future was snatched away by a false memory .
such a discovery has made me more tolerant of the everyday memory mistakes that my friends and family members make .
i &apos;m not quite sure .
now , i am going to show you how my bow works .
he said , &quot; &quot; everything i &apos;ve been telling you for the last 20 years , forget about it . it was wrong .
there is only one circumstance in which they always , all of them , walk on two legs , and that is when they are wading through water .
why was it that the best architects , the greatest architecture — all beautiful and visionary and innovative — is also so rare , and seems to serve so very few ?
&quot; &quot; where are the architects ? &quot; &quot; paul said .
so , i left his office and i was walking through the hospital , and that &apos;s when i had my epiphany .
i wouldn &apos;t have my new hip for this ted .
how do we get people to think differently about what we really want ?
so we started looking at inequality , and we did some large-scale surveys around the u.s. and other countries .
and then i struggled , because i was thinking to myself , &quot; &quot; what should i talk ? what should i do ? it &apos;s a ted audience .
how is that possible ? if you look at the visions we have , the visions of how we &apos;re going to change the world , the key thing is implementation . we have the vision .
the three plants are areca palm , mother-in-law &apos;s tongue and money plant .
with these three plants , you can grow all the fresh air you need .
thank you .
seven-year-old justin senigar came to our clinic with this diagnosis of very severe autism .
several times we can repeat that .
because it &apos;s very hollow , all the noise will disappear , so it &apos;s a very silent road .
what about 75 ?
so let me narrow the choices down to two .
the first is to tell you something about pollen , i hope , and to convince you that it &apos;s more than just something that gets up your nose .
and finally , in a rather grizzly way , the bosnia war crimes ; some of the people brought to trial were brought to trial because of the evidence from pollen , which showed that bodies had been buried , exhumed and then reburied somewhere else .
so my process is very straightforward .
and my daily language is english .
number five : if you don &apos;t know , say that you don &apos;t know .
number four : go with the flow .
and , on a final note , retirement in spanish is jubilación .
society decides when we are old , usually around 65 , when we get medicare , but we really start aging at birth .
well , tonight he sleeps safely with a stack of letters just like this one tucked beneath his pillow , scripted by strangers who were there for him when .
they &apos;re the ones from my generation , the ones of us that have grown up into a world where everything is paperless , and where some of our best conversations have happened upon a screen .
millions were suffering , but few spoke , and it was the most scary thing when you have all around such people who kill and who flog , and you speak for your rights .
but we came across a new phenomenon .
after all , in this country as well , all sorts of myths and misconceptions go around immunization .
and i cut it into smaller questions , and i have the answer to these smaller questions .
but we got a clean learning curve , almost exactly the same as what you would get in a school .
so keep both of those ideas of remoteness .
so with design for education , i think the most important thing is to have a shared ownership of the solutions with the teachers , so that they have the incentive and the desire to use them .
there are more buildings that are empty or in disrepair than occupied and in use .
it was unacceptable .
the couple are barely 18 years old .
in high school , i liked english and math and art and i built websites and i played guitar in a punk band called frustrated telephone operator .
three . five . three . five . five . ok .
hazrat ali is from a poor farming family in swat .
now these children are primed to become suicide bombers .
so here &apos;s how it looks . look at the region there .
what is a conscious mind ?
that malaise and worry that some who know feel reminds them of the 1930s ?
we face a problem of your and my relations .
( laughter ) that &apos;s kellar autumn , my former ph.d. student , professor now at lewis and clark , literally giving his first-born child up for this test . ( laughter )
but geckos do it better .
all of which were delivered by flat bed , on a truck , and hand assembled in 48 hours by a team of eight people , only one of whom had ever seen the plans before .
this is the work of a firm called shop , and what you &apos;re seeing here , is their isometric drawings of what will be a large-scale camera obscura in a public park .
here &apos;s a question that matters .
we do know that if you expose our bodies as they currently are to a lot of radiation , we will die .
that &apos;s quite an incredible prediction .
it was made in stars like that , locked away and then returned to the universe in explosions like that in order to recondense into planets , stars , new solar systems and , indeed , people like us .
did you throw it , or did you pass it effectively ?
but when the next runner runs super-fast , is it because she made a super effort , or because of the way the third runner passed the baton ?
shareholders ? customers ?
it is even counterproductive .
rather , when smart autos exchange electricity and information through smart buildings with smart grids , they &apos;re adding to the grid valuable flexibility and storage that help the grid integrate varying solar and wind power .
three-fourths of our electricity powers buildings .
you don &apos;t have the depth of conviction .
adam i is built by building on your strengths .
we can &apos;t change the world overnight for our children , but we can give them a safe and private place to escape that world , if only for just a minute .
we all need air to breathe .
so there it is , 50 years later , sitting there — sort of suspended animation .
i don &apos;t know if you remember a mac that was 16 megahertz , that &apos;s slow speed .
and there it was , a great revolution .
we need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy .
and i gave in to the staged swim .
and the dream was crushed .
these are led lights that help the roughly billion people out there , for whom nightfall means darkness , to have a new means of operating .
we &apos;re expecting to have upwards of 200 million refugees by the year 2020 because of climate change and political instability .
and then on the right is what i refer to as a footnote panel .
haigh &apos;s chocolate , in collaboration with the foundation for rabbit-free australia , stopped all production of the easter bunny in chocolate and has replaced it with the easter bilby .
( applause ) yab : you can also go to the website , answer — respond to the questions also .
we all share the same need for the earth &apos;s gifts — the same wish to rise above ourselves , and become better .
we find that they show emotions , similar to — maybe sometimes the same — as those that we describe in ourselves as happiness , sadness , fear , despair .
somebody said that yesterday .
in fact , it &apos;s not just a matter of equity .
ninety-nine percent of the people in those neighborhoods don &apos;t have cars .
pm : and there were certain words , too .
( applause ) pm : and you &apos;re doing that even though your recovery has to remain front and center for both of you .
&quot; &quot; maybe the words can make the image without anything else happening .
so i took another crack at it — you &apos;ve got to keep it moving — and i xeroxed some words on pieces of colored paper and i pasted them down on an ugly board .
they rock the mic outside my window every morning .
i mean , if you can talk it , a mockingbird can squawk it .
it allows you to set your own criteria for what sort of things you want to look at .
yes , certainly you can do it over here .
will you ?
all of a sudden , my fears were minimized .
but in that 350 years , the place has just undergone a lot of changes .
and then you figure out better and better ways to do it .
i designed the process that generated the form .
we can change the folding ratio again to produce this shape , or this shape .
talk to me . yes . yes . you can say yes .
i have a little cuban mother — she &apos;s about that big .
and so this is basically a song about loops , but not the kind of loops that i make up here .
so , i &apos;ve been working on this song that mentions these things and then also imagines a person who &apos;s been so successful at defending themselves from heartbreak that they &apos;re left to do the deed themselves , if that &apos;s possible .
these are the dispensers . there &apos;s this friendly shape .
and the values we bring can be about environmental issues , about sustainability , about lower power consumption .
in africa , gondwana molded proteas .
primates emerge from jungles , as tarsiers first , becoming lemurs not much later .
now i felt like i was — ( laughter ) i felt like i was talking to nick again .
this was a big deal , and we said , &quot; &quot; we &apos;ve got to publish this . &quot; &quot; we submitted the paper .
and this one had to get broken up .
and what that is is i imagine explaining a work of art to my grandmother in five minutes , and if i can &apos;t explain it in five minutes , then it &apos;s too obtuse or esoteric and it hasn &apos;t been refined enough yet .
see , crucial point here : math is not equal to calculating .
so there &apos;s another thing that comes up with basics .
luckily , with now better point-of-sale tracking , more digital media consumption , you can measure more what consumers actually do , rather than what they say they do .
and there are parallels for marketing — you can invest for a long time in a brand , but a single contrary observation of that positioning will destroy consumers &apos; belief .
we have no idea .
i have two minutes to tell you that it &apos;s going to the limits of your imagination .
so i felt like our cellphones and our fancy watches and our cameras had stopped us from dreaming .
we &apos;re harnessing energy from the sun .
and they said scaling , which is the build-up of minerals inside of pipes .
that &apos;s very exciting for fuel cells — to be able to do that without platinum .
why ?
accelerometers on each hand read hand position .
i &apos;m going to talk to you tonight about coming out of the closet , and not in the traditional sense , not just the gay closet .
so i take a deep breath and i look down and staring back at me is a four-year-old girl in a pink dress , not a challenge to a feminist duel , just a kid with a question : &quot; are you a boy or are you a girl ? &quot;
we set ourselves a modest target of 500 farmers insured after our first season .
they were waiting to see what would happen , didn &apos;t trust insurance companies , or thought , &quot; &quot; i &apos;ve managed for so many years .
( laughter ) and i &apos;m not alone .
these have to be identified by scientific investigation .
( music ) ( applause ) i &apos;m jon m. chu . and i &apos;m not a dancer , i &apos;m not a choreographer — i &apos;m actually a filmmaker , a storyteller .
and then another thing opens , you close that .
luther was one of 40 tocamacho children who started grammar school , the sons and daughters of a black indigenous people known as the garífuna , 20 percent of the honduran population .
elam &apos;s faculty had no handy evidence base to guide them , so they learned the hard way , by doing and correcting course as they went .
but private communities , private , corporate , privatizing communities , are not bottom-up democracies .
social media were blocked at the firewall .
it &apos;s not the worst thing in the world .
so , i might as well come clean about it .
but what are states and nations ?
again , money is not an objective reality ; it has no objective value .
so it was almost like coming out of the closet to actually talk about the fact that we were women and that we believed that we had a set of values and a way of doing business that would be more sustainable than what we had experienced until then .
and i know that consumers are becoming more conscious , and they are going to start voting with their wallets , and they are going to change the face of business and finance from the outside , if they don &apos;t do it from the inside .
large companies moved away from it because they thought the science was so difficult and vaccines were seen as poor business .
do you worry about what is going to kill you ?
i was a delegate representing the great state of new jersey at the 2008 dnc .
i have always loved the fact that my hood and my affliction share the same initials .
there &apos;s a straight line , and there is an infinite number of lines that go through the point and never meet the original line .
one . great . okay .
especially if you &apos;re me , &apos; cause alzheimer &apos;s tends to run in families .
i &apos;m doing yoga and tai chi to improve my balance , so that when i start to lose it , i &apos;ll still be able to be mobile .
look at facebook , waiting to build a social network until after myspace and friendster .
a lot of people think they will .
only we humans make waste that nature can &apos;t digest .
let &apos;s talk trash .
and so we decided that we were going to sponsor tony , tempt , and his cause .
thank you guys very much . that was awesome .
and so we found it was pretty helpful to have laundry machines , for our younger employees especially , and ...
and they &apos;re labeled by color right now , by language .
and that results in the ridiculously detrimental lack of diversity in our workforce , particularly in areas of influence .
the idea of finding someone different to mentor , someone who doesn &apos;t come from the same background as you , whatever that background is , is about opening doors for people who couldn &apos;t even get to the damn hallway .
and during my ph.d , i wanted to know exactly what chemicals from our skin mosquitos used , african malarial mosquitos use to track us down at night .
and you know what ? it worked .
but , sadly , i never bonded with them again .
indeed , i couldn &apos;t open a bank account without my husband &apos;s permission .
instead of making better choices , we become overwhelmed by choice , sometimes even afraid of it .
in france , the doctors decided whether and when the life support would be removed , while in the united states , the final decision rested with the parents .
something amazing happened during this shoot .
in this photograph a hostile crowd in a slum surrounds him .
it was really fun ; i was just drawing on the layers of resin .
anyway , this is a lady creature .
( laughter ) and then life was fine , dandy .
i was a south indian brought up in bengal .
so it &apos;s really a play between these two approaches .
what happens if one of the engines stops ?
but networks are not just a scientific metaphor .
i think many of you in the audience have probably seen family trees .
this was in the middle of the 20th century when music from the heart , beautiful music , wasn &apos;t the most popular thing in the classical music world .
we are so honored to be here at tedwomen , sharing our music with you .
it is really in this sense of discovery that i have a new set of questions that i &apos;m asking .
one of the things that happened very distinctly in the course of this exhibition is i was confronted with the idea of how powerful images can be in people &apos;s understanding of themselves and each other .
and this tells you , of course , how much you had in rem sleep , in deep sleep , and all this sort of thing .
we lose 700,000 people a year in the u.s. from sudden cardiac death .
like any form of systematic oppression , fatphobia is deeply rooted in complex structures like capitalism , patriarchy and racism , and that can make it really difficult to see , let alone challenge .
we may even blame fat people themselves for the discrimination they face because , after all , if we don &apos;t like it , we should just lose weight .
there &apos;s just something about them that works on our emotions .
roman mars : according to the north american vexillological association .
i want to get under the skin .
sure . people are always present in my photos , no matter whether they appear to portray tortoises or cougars or lions .
it has the same conditions as the human body — 37 degrees centigrade , 95 percent oxygen .
and there &apos;s a 3d elevator that then actually goes down one layer at a time each time the printhead goes through .
it &apos;s a shared resource from which we all drink .
i wanted to be an astronaut when i was a little kid , but growing up in canada as a young girl , that wasn &apos;t really available to me .
what i want you all to do right now is to think of this mammal that i &apos;m going to describe to you .
so tonight , when you walk out of here and you look up in the night skies , and you see this beautiful flying mammal , i want you to smile . thank you . ( applause )
i get — i &apos;m often asked , you know , for me , what have been some of the special moments from having worked on this film .
it &apos;s not true . very unsafe .
it &apos;s done through a form of subtraction or obstruction or interference in a world that we naturally sleepwalk through .
thank you very much .
the machines we build continue to suffer from mechanical failures .
cat fleas , for example , have the ability to jump about a hundred times their height .
now , everyone was very excited to try it out .
so this tendency towards order is not always a good thing .
( applause )
there &apos;s people getting drunk building lego , and you &apos;ve got to finish the thing before you puke .
between what happens in politics and what happens in real life , and in that gap , a battlefield mentality .
without hesitation , she replied , &quot; &quot; i &apos;ve had an abortion . &quot; &quot; before polly , no one had ever told me that she &apos;d had an abortion .
this grew to a small community , to almost an entire movement of people in defense of the sea .
so let &apos;s think big and let &apos;s think deep .
i remember that i started my shift at 8 a.m. , and by 8 , i already had a list of 50 scheduled visits .
this generated an immediate impact .
and , playing , i realized that the maneuverability of this was really amazing , and i could avoid an obstacle at the very last second , more maneuverable than a normal boat .
so if you &apos;re looking at the boat from this side , this might remind you of an airplane profile .
but suppose then that one of them mutates .
others overcome their self at raves .
let &apos;s have some risks .
and that allows us to accelerate how this stuff happens .
and what do you know ? they immediately overloaded the load cell .
and the second they get into that time point when they can &apos;t strike any more , they just signal . they wave their legs around .
( noisy conversation ) this study in germany found the average noise level in classrooms is 65 decibels .
in a classroom with a reverberation time of 1.2 seconds , which is pretty common , this is what it sounds like .
edi : yeah . it &apos;s all part of the illusion , marco .
edi : hi . i &apos;m edi . will you be my friend ?
and it &apos;s just me and janitor man .
if you look up high enough , you could see me .
we can average the two and see what that means . ( laughter ) and he goes , &quot; ma &apos;am , i just don &apos;t want you to have a miscarriage . &quot;
i can try to be really still for 20 minutes .
and he said , &quot; &quot; the lighter your touch , the better you become at improving and enriching your performance .
i want you all to hold your hand just like this : your finger — put it up .
now to many commentators , cumulative cultural adaptation , or social learning , is job done , end of story .
they &apos;re far closer together than that . &quot; &quot; and it &apos;s true ; there are places on that island where you can encounter a new language in under a mile .
less of us are doing that .
thank you .
it turns out that kids love it when the character becomes real and enters into their world .
it could help you set goals and track your progress , and it would help motivate you .
we wanted this picture of us on the fjord and on the screen at the same time .
richard gizbert : norway is a country that gets relatively little media coverage .
but they &apos;re always doing things by themselves .
we sought children from the time they &apos;re born .
she said , &quot; &quot; the cancer center was wonderful .
and the nearest ferry crossing from fife is from burntisland .
what if it &apos;s not even the key part of it ?
and then we were really skeptical , because it was too good to be true .
&quot; &quot; sit , &quot; &quot; sniff butt .
every time he jumps up , he gets all sorts of abuse .
anyhow , nobody would have followed them , except for a handful &#91; of &#93; men and women of conviction and courage .
it was my grandfather who decided they needed false documents .
( laughter ) ( applause ) it &apos;s not that easy !
aids was a disfiguring disease that killed you , and hiv is an invisible virus that makes you take a pill every day .
and what struck me immediately was how in love the two of these people were .
this is her cooking teacher .
we &apos;re going to actually move even further down as we go from this lattice of atoms to one single hydrogen atom .
think of the allosphere as a large , dynamically varying digital microscope that &apos;s connected to a supercomputer .
the iraqi insurgent had placed the ied , an improvised explosive device , along the side of the road with great care .
if you remember that in that fictional world , robots started out carrying out mundane chores , and then they started taking on life-and-death decisions .
and we ask the question as a function of the three different lives , how much life satisfaction do you get ?
this is the most venerable of the happinesses , traditionally .
in 2007 , zero launched a green campaign , suggesting his friends and fans to turn off their electricity every sunday from 7 : 53 to 8 : 00 p.m.
zero wants to engage the generation of today and tomorrow , tell various stories through different mediums .
great — google away .
you need to identify your own personal bias .
one stood out in particular .
so i was like , &quot; &quot; awesome . this is great . &quot; &quot; and then i got this email . and there &apos;s a little bit of a back story to this .
she cuts the umbilical cord with a stick , and ties it with her own hair .
they have no education and no freedom .
the public comes in , and the first thing you have to do is dress in lab coats .
and after six hours were finished , i ...
if he would have gotten to the church , it wouldn &apos;t have made a difference , because the lights were out ; nobody was home .
someone with the wrong color shirt on , on the wrong street corner at the wrong time .
until the only things that you have left are these cells here , the output cells , the ones that send the signals to the brain , but because of all that degeneration they aren &apos;t sending any signals anymore .
so , when we did this for responses from the standard method and from our encoder and transducer .
there wasn &apos;t this dialogue going on that i imagined was happening .
now , as you heard in the intro , i work in intensive care , and i think i &apos;ve kind of lived through the heyday of intensive care . it &apos;s been a ride , man .
and what we &apos;re left with after removing all the apple cells is this cellulose scaffold .
it &apos;s how i train my mind to be unconventional and to be creative and to decide to make human apple ears .
it &apos;s about death .
there &apos;s a bit of randomness here too because , when i was beginning independent diplomat , i went to a party in the house of lords , which is a ridiculous place , but i was holding my drink like this , and i bumped into this guy who was standing behind me .
last year when i was here , i was speaking to you about a swim which i did across the north pole .
and i firmly believe that what we &apos;re seeing in the himalayas is the next great , big battleground on this earth .
and i really want to thank veronica jauriqui for making this very fashionable presentation .
nowadays , we don &apos;t really recognize a book as something that sits on our shelf or music as something that is a physical object that we can hold .
well , trying to stay out of trouble was a little unavoidable .
i need to be in class because i need to graduate . &quot; &quot; so he knew that i was not going to let him be a victim of his circumstance , but we were going to push forward and keep moving on .
i can &apos;t deal with any threat . this was a big threat .
they are ruthless , they are honest , but they &apos;re full of energy and fun .
it &apos;s something that is totally out of the bell curve .
just this one example is worth a lot of work .
superman &apos;s parents die on krypton before the age of one .
( applause ) so &quot; &quot; the 99 &quot; &quot; is technology ; it &apos;s entertainment ; it &apos;s design .
he , like einstein , was in search of what we call a unified theory .
but we believe the answer for why those numbers have the values they do may rely on the form of the extra dimensions .
everybody thought the answer is , send things to india and china .
and so we &apos;re starting up a program to do out-of-print works , but loaning them .
so then we tried picking words that came from specific parts of speech , so how about noun-verb-adjective-noun .
he says , in fact , you &apos;ve already remembered it .
but it is a place where sex workers and their clients come .
and as a marketer , i found that curious .
it &apos;s a very powerful word , jihad , if you look at it in that respect , and there &apos;s a certain almost mystical resonance to it .
and it filled this old imam , it filled him with great sadness .
this judge is someone you &apos;d never want to play poker with .
and the car sped off .
we know where it &apos;s gotten warmer .
we can look at other examples .
instead , i have progressed , and i am , today , launching a brand new analog teaching technology that i picked up from ikea : this box .
child survival is the new green .
how do we construct something like this ?
my design , as it takes you down the rabbit hole , is fraught with many challenges and difficulties in the real world .
secondly , the stasi was a secret police .
first of all , the stasi was an intelligence service .
well , we asked the swedes like this , and that gives you a hint , doesn &apos;t it ?
let &apos;s move into the future .
people who got infections either recovered , if they were lucky , or they died .
a few days later , his shoulder started to hurt .
i don &apos;t know about that , but i just know that i get too many marketing emails .
i said , &quot; &quot; not to worry .
she &apos;s talking to the pilot . she &apos;s 5,000 miles away , but she &apos;s assumed command .
we begin to go on the hill and lobby .
and within one year , by 1915 , there were 50,000 rides per day in seattle , 45,000 rides per day in kansas and 150,000 rides per day in los angeles .
and so at uber we like the hard problems and we like getting excited about those and solving them .
she said , &quot; only my son believed i could do this . i didn &apos;t think this was for me . &quot;
our customers have used their loans for family expenses , emergencies , travel and for investing back into growing their businesses .
from gando , my home village in burkina faso , to berlin in germany to become an architect is a big , big step .
but for us , the rain is good .
and like airport traffic control , as they start to go past us they &apos;re called back — and they &apos;re called back and back and back .
no salt , no pepper , no oil , no spices .
( applause ) we realized that perhaps we could use this technology not only in circuits that control your movement but also circuits that control other things , and the next thing that we took on was circuits that control your mood .
we &apos;re going to do this in people that have cognitive deficits , and we &apos;ve chosen to treat patients with alzheimer &apos;s disease who have cognitive and memory deficits .
( applause )
the fbi &apos;s training documents on eco-terrorism are not about violence , they &apos;re about public relations .
i &apos;d like to sing in basque , which is the language spoken in the basque country where i live , in the region in france and spain .
and it &apos;s very difficult to tune .
that &apos;s what opportunity-makers do .
and as i started to look at people , which is mostly all i did , i noticed that some people really wanted attention and recognition .
but you don &apos;t find homogenous material assemblies in nature .
working with an ancient material , one of the first lifeforms on the planet , plenty of water and a little bit of synthetic biology , we were able to transform a structure made of shrimp shells into an architecture that behaves like a tree .
this is a morning in vancouver in 2015 .
( applause ) yeah , yeah !
( laughter ) ( applause ) i think of that as the first user on the plant facebook , right ?
is it getting too much water ?
they said we couldn &apos;t do iraq .
the point about the trigger-pullers and special operations command .
i had never thought about insects living in complex societies .
it kills off bacteria and molds and other germs within the colony , and so it bolsters the colony health and their social immunity .
we &apos;re going to have a problem with power in the next five years in this country .
( laughter ) energy , at the moment , is dominated by resource .
two eyes at the bottom , optic nerve flowing out from the back .
there &apos;s no structure . it won &apos;t tell you anything .
and we &apos;re going to focus on the most important meal of the day , breakfast .
this program has been incredibly successful , because it helped us overcome a very difficult barrier when it came to getting kids a nutritious breakfast .
this is land close to land that we manage in zimbabwe .
the production of grass , shrubs , trees , wildlife , everything is now more productive , and we have virtually no fear of dry years .
health is not just a personal responsibility or phenomenon .
what is most compelling is that every day , every week , i hear stories just like veronica &apos;s .
and they showed us a range ways that light can work with simple senses and physical objects to really bring the internet to life , to make it tangible .
no ?
it was a precursor to india , a messenger from gondwana — a lost paradise of dinosaurs isolated for millions of years .
we need to delve into this mass of anatomy that we &apos;ve been compiling to understand where the changes are occurring and what this means .
to do that , we actually had to comprehensively be able to look at all that genetic information and determine what those differences were between the mother , the father and the child .
we had to get more granular than that , though , and so we had to start opening those books , and in some cases , the genetic change was more subtle .
you &apos;d be surprised how kids are affected by this .
we are the soil .
and he described the diversity within crops — all the different kinds of wheat and rice and such — as a genetic resource .
i can &apos;t think of anything else that &apos;s happened in my lifetime that way .
and we knew , basically , dna provides the information for rna .
and , you know , you understand life as it now exists through evolution .
and their farms are also large .
a fifth of kids under two drinks soda .
so this is what i call a &quot; &quot; don &apos;t eat me &quot; &quot; wetsuit .
after all , did the wright brothers discover manned flight , or did they observe the biological fact of flight and translate that mechanically , replicate it in a way that humans could use ?
but the doctors of the day thought he was crazy , because they knew , and had for hundreds of years , that odorous vapors called miasmas caused disease , not these hypothetical particles that you couldn &apos;t see .
we now look at what i want to talk about tonight , in two ideas .
you actually put action to the issues you care about .
so , what your letter means : i &apos;ve got to tell you , we are all in a party , and political officials are the pinatas .
that &apos;s a piece of history , but it comes in a mathematical wrapping .
the reason for that is that the historical record is becoming digitized at a very fast pace .
and nuclear obviously provides a lot of power — 24 hours a day , seven days a week .
you know how you &apos;ve got 10 years where you &apos;re demonstrating that reactor ?
we have a website , it &apos;s all there . these are the home recipes .
it &apos;ll dim .
so if you do choose to interact with the piece , and you press the blender button , it actually sends this character into this dizzying disarray of dishevelment .
you know , just like people on the street when you get too close to them .
how can you reach inside and interact with the digital information using the full dexterity of our hands ?
and what &apos;s more exciting than just turning what &apos;s currently in the computer physical is to start imagining how programming the world will alter even our daily physical activities .
and the difference then , they perceive as a loss .
how about the people who can &apos;t do that because they have no access — the people in the midwest for example ?
harvard was wrong , big time . ( laughter ) of course , we know today that galaxies extend far beyond our own galaxy .
and thanks to the creators of the worldwide telescope , we can now start to have a dialogue with the universe .
so the human brain may be remarkable , yes , but it is not special in its number of neurons .
nine hours of feeding per day seems to be the practical limit for a primate .
now , part of the reason for this is that we have an oversimplified and increasingly outmoded view of the biological basis of psychiatric disorders .
now , it &apos;s not that chemicals are not important in psychiatric disorders .
that &apos;s usually followed by a second thought , which is , whatever it is that i &apos;m doing , i love it .
i &apos;m not sure why that would be .
and so i was surprised when i noticed one day that the conservatives had disappeared from my facebook feed .
and the thing is that the algorithms don &apos;t yet have the kind of embedded ethics that the editors did .
after a while , i got a bit — i wanted to go somewhere else .
when did you do a video with him ?
we can play the original in one ear , and a new recording in the other .
and in the right speaker is going to be the original recording , and the left speaker is going to be the new recording , actually of an instrument just like that one , and i &apos;m going to play them together at the same time .
so when i do my job , people hate me .
it actually sounds really hokey to say it standing up here , but when you try to put it in practice , it &apos;s really powerful .
now , there are around a thousand trucks and buses and cars there .
most important of all , i didn &apos;t know what that was the first time i heard it .
look at china &apos;s one-child policy .
and let &apos;s say we went the sort of traditional route , and there &apos;s our kid swinging on the swing , and frankly , they &apos;re kind of a mess .
( applause )
there &apos;s a building in london that &apos;s nine stories , a new building that just finished in australia that i believe is 10 or 11 .
will they be gainfully employed ? &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) &quot; or are they going to be wreaking havoc in some waterway ? &quot;
&apos;cause they &apos;re in a desert ? &apos; cause they save money ? yeah .
so just take a guess in your mind which one is the dolphin .
the dolphin &apos;s at the keyboard .
he did do it . the tender had nothing in it that related to us , nothing specific about sunlight-readable , mesh-network , low-power , but just a vanilla laptop proposal .
and it &apos;s not to go out and buy 100 or 1,000 , though , i invite you to do that , and 10,000 would be even better .
and it was friggin &apos; demoralizing . it was terrible .
now when facts come in handy like that — i love that story because it shows you the power of one fact , one remembered fact in exactly the right place at the right time — normally something that &apos;s easier to see on game shows than in real life .
some did , not everybody .
and we also know that the world has changed in other ways , that since 1960 there are one-third as many new countries that exist as independent entities on the planet .
and that is a circumstance that could supply the chemical energy and the chemical compounds needed to sustain life .
and the tiny water crystals here now look for all the world like they are frozen droplets of salty water , which is a discovery that suggests that not only do the jets come from pockets of liquid water , but that that liquid water is in contact with rock .
well , animals do and can provide extremely useful information .
right here in my hand is a breathing , living human lung on a chip .
but the fun doesn &apos;t have to end there , maybe you want to be even more anonymous .
so , what exactly does global witness do ?
coal . coal turns out to be virtually the same stuff . it is probably plants , except that these have been burned and crushed under pressure .
and 50 percent of the eu budget is going to subsidize agriculture from mountains of stuff that people have overproduced .
you &apos;re damn right , it was .
or that game the other day ? was that awesome ?
and even though mount chimborazo isn &apos;t the tallest mountain in the andes , it &apos;s one degree away from the equator , it &apos;s riding that bulge , and so the summit of chimborazo is the farthest point on earth from the center of the earth .
chimborazo !
he was infected with hiv .
according to those same estimates , in 2010 1.8 million people died of aids related causes .
why ? because it is a quantum phenomenon . it &apos;s quantum physics .
and by doing that , what it actually does is locking itself in place .
electric fields are not ionizing radiation , like x-rays or proton beams , that bombard tissue to disrupt dna .
and the therapy is delivered continuously at home , without having to go into the hospital either periodically or continually .
for that reason , it &apos;s one of the few places where we can fearlessly be ourselves and just ... talk .
i &apos;ve been lucky enough to have denny as my barber for the last eight years .
the processing , of course , begins with the eyes .
so if you look around the stage here you &apos;ll create a kind of mental map of the stage .
and so the classroom started to feel a little bit small , so we found an industrial site in hong kong , and we turned it into the largest mega-space focused on social and environmental impact .
so plastic , oil and radioactivity are horrible , horrible legacies , but the very worst legacy that we can leave our children is lies .
you &apos;ve heard of peak oil .
it uses a lot less fresh water than , for example , cattle , where you have to irrigate a field so that you can grow the food to graze the cattle .
let &apos;s remind ourselves that cells are not an abstract concept .
but what &apos;s really amazing is that the cells , when we electrically stimulate them , like with a pacemaker , that they beat so much more .
and by just presenting the samples once more to the rats and looping those results back , we were able to increase case detection rates by over 30 percent .
thank you very much .
so take , for example , the smile and the smirk .
gender .
we can do more education , we can try to convince these people to use the nets .
malaria occurs in some of the poorest and most remote places on earth , and there &apos;s a reason for that .
and to be an architect , somehow you have to negotiate between left and right , and you have to negotiate between this very private place where ideas take place and the outside world , and then make it understood .
again , a direct reflection from using these processes to develop extremely complicated , very large-scale organisms .
five minutes i &apos;ll spend just because it &apos;s interesting . just because it &apos;s fun .
now , take the same problem , chunk it into little modules , and motivations become trivial .
for you to leap from a place of certainty , to take a chance on that someone or something unknown , you need a force to pull you over the gap , and that remarkable force is trust .
( laughter ) ( applause ) i &apos;ll do it with you .
and we can find those that we would call habitable , meaning that they have similar conditions to the conditions that we experience here on earth and where a lot of complex chemistry can happen .
am i that charming ?
how wide would the verge have to be for that to work out ?
let &apos;s say they do 30 miles per gallon .
and it has a long history of being connected to space through observations of the stars .
we did extra-vehicular activities , as you can see here , wearing mock-up space suits , but we also had our chores and lots of other stuff to do , like questionnaires at the end of every day .
( applause )
you can farm one pound of fish with just one pound of feed , and depending on species , even less .
the very biggest brand-name schools are asking that of our young adults , but here &apos;s the good news .
you know , i didn &apos;t set out to be a parenting expert .
so that was how i first started to explore the way things moved , and expressed it .
after many years of bending gears with a pair of pliers , i made that tool , and then i made this other tool for sort of centering gears very quickly — sort of developing my own little world of technology .
if you have more consideration for others , you will make sure that you remedy inequality , that you bring some kind of well-being within society , in education , at the workplace .
but not everyone looks like a rascal .
battered , bruised , you start again .
i went to a very elitist , snobbish , expensive education in india , and that almost destroyed me .
three trees together , we create the forest .
one tree is a tree . two trees together , we have the woods .
i wore these already for five years until i moved out of that town .
after all , they have grown up accepting such restrictions as norms .
and as you can see , we have a patchwork across this ocean .
it &apos;s the only threat , the only influence that the reef had to deal with .
yr : this phrase is now etched into my mind clearer than the pin number to my bank card , so i can pretend i speak chinese fluently .
instead , people from across the road , they would shout things like — hp and yr : arriba ! arriba ! Ándale ! Ándale !
and what does he see but a burglar with a gun in his hand .
president clinton , if you &apos;re here , thank you .
five years ago , i was asked to moderate a panel of executives , and the topic for the evening was &quot; what do you look for in high-potential employees ? &quot;
they said , &quot; &quot; we look for people who are smart and hard working and committed and trustworthy and resilient . &quot; &quot; so which element of leadership does that relate to ?
beyond the cosmic accounting of what goes in to what goes out , one of the hot topics in blazar astrophysics right now is where the highest-energy jet emission comes from .
the objects that have captivated me from first crush throughout my career are supermassive , hyperactive black holes .
because sometimes these questions don &apos;t have easy answers .
it started out as a cathartic exercise .
that is my grandfather .
( laughter ) grandma.com would be a recipe for biscuits and spit-bath instructions .
but compare it with the freestanding , disconnected blocks proposed by the official project for rebuilding baba amr .
what are the principles that we should adopt in order to avoid repeating the same mistakes ?
( laughter ) yeah , another 53 years , ok ?
we wanted to be the only political party with no particular political leaning .
how might we use that data to make a difference ?
and that &apos;s when i realized that litterati was more than just pretty pictures ; we were becoming a community that was collecting data .
maybe the swami is right .
there &apos;s no indian compassion .
i was an outsider who had come back to iran to find my place , but i was not in a position to be critical of the government or the ideology of the islamic revolution .
every iranian artist , in one form or another , is political .
do you know what i &apos;m talking about ? ( laughter ) yeah .
eleven . it &apos;s not bad .
she was 105 years old when i took this picture .
you take kate , i &apos;ll take sal ; we &apos;ll both have a johnson gal . you take kate , i &apos;ll take sal ; we &apos;ll both have a johnson gal .
the library of the free university , which opened last year , is an example of that .
this is the view you would get , if you looked down on that .
and since what &apos;s impossible is always unknown , it allows me to believe i can cheat the impossible .
and i put the rope around and around and around and around and around till i had no more rope .
it sounds a little bit like science fiction .
this is a blood vessel in the body .
basically again reaffirming that when adults believe in children and say , &quot; &quot; you can , &quot; &quot; then they will .
i also realized i should have got infected when i was seven .
he takes the uniform off . he &apos;s no longer sergeant jones in his community . he &apos;s now dave from kansas city .
going back , that same 18-year-old boy graduates from high school in kansas city , missouri , joins the army , the army gives him a rifle , they send him to iraq .
and by rating it and by rating the different people who submit information , we can get refined results and weighted results .
so we think that there is something interesting we can do here .
jd : thank you .
but we have to also consider that the crispr technology can be used for things like enhancement .
it &apos;s not permanently in the exclusive economic zones of these five central american countries , but it moves with the season .
so today i &apos;m going to take you on a voyage to cast light on some of the outdated myths and legends and assumptions that have kept us as the true stakeholders in the high seas in the dark .
because that is what has changed , is the speed at which we &apos;re taking all our resources .
it was 23 metric tons for one liter .
i &apos;m going to pass this onto the tampa office . they &apos;re the ones who initiated this .
bg : hasan , thank you very much . ( he : thank you . ) ( applause )
i didn &apos;t come from the northeast or from san francisco .
i learned how to make a damn good biscuit recipe .
so i &apos;m specifically interested in how we , as humans , relate to ourselves , each other and the world around us .
( laughter ) so just to give you a bit of context , as june said , i &apos;m an artist , a technologist and an educator .
i think we can afford to be optimistic .
yv : well , there &apos;s a great degree of hypocrisy .
thank you .
so in fact , these species didn &apos;t move at all .
the prison warden , looking equally indifferent , said , &quot; &quot; any trouble , just press the red buzzer , and we &apos;ll be around as soon as we can . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) i sat down .
it is more akin to a swiss army knife with fixed mental modules finely honed during development and a sharp sense of fairness .
so you want to swap those out with some good , sustainably harvested fish .
we as a society are eating twice as much meat as we did in the 50s .
now , in theory , all of these questions could be answered by imagery , but not if it &apos;s old .
although i was a satellite engineer , i hadn &apos;t thought about using satellite imagery in my work .
but the middle class is clearly under huge threat right now .
right ? great , hang up , flourish , go home .
and secondly , how the hell can we tell the difference between two molecules that differ by a single carbon atom ?
so if you think of knowledge being this ever-expanding ripple on a pond , the important thing to realize is that our ignorance , the circumference of this knowledge , also grows with knowledge .
in the next scene , wall-e comes back to life .
there are scenes in every movie that struggle to come together .
but then i knew for certain that although my body might be limited , it was my spirit that was unstoppable .
and then everything went black .
and actually , although we &apos;ve got a long way to go and a lot of work to do , i can see the day where my two great passions — cars and the environment — actually come into harmony .
today the average driver in beijing has a five-hour commute .
think about that for a minute : 1.1 billion dollars , 26 years old .
i love the internet . i love my mobile devices .
all this stuff that happens around .
( laughter ) until i got to the true young global leader , shimon peres , president of israel , and he ran a beautiful manipulation on me .
( laughs ) yeah , i know . ( laughs ) and the people in the back go , &quot; &quot; ok , i didn &apos;t really see that . &quot; &quot; people in the satellite room are starting to move in now .
( applause ) ( laughter ) normally now , i would take the needle out .
the fear and the pressure to do something on them is going to be immense . they are going to make mistakes .
the son &apos;s dead . the father lives .
thanks .
and i want to tell you how we were able to make sense out of this code .
as i started this work , it was not always easy to convince the women to participate .
umm el-saad , asma and fayza , and many women across the arab world , show that it is possible to overcome barriers to education , which they know is the best means to a better future .
when you think about it , using perception instead of categories is much easier said than done .
you may have already experienced the dogs and babies principle .
television , entertainment , food , travel , business — everything was changing , and both the public and private sectors were colluding to give us the lives we wanted .
it was just an idea .
you both have too much time on your hands and not much money .
people who have an existing framework , an economic framework , an engineering framework , feel that actually logic is its own answer .
if that subtly nudges you to feel about them identically , that &apos;s going to make it easier to save .
and what that means is that every time you discuss the future , or any kind of a future event , grammatically you &apos;re forced to cleave that from the present and treat it as if it &apos;s something viscerally different .
they &apos;re just closer to home .
you could say that i look for choice alien real estate .
( music : &quot; &quot; rapper &apos;s delight &quot; &quot; by the sugarhill gang ) the mc would improvise lyrics in the same way that the jazz players would improvise melodies .
it actually improves it .
so , here &apos;s the first story .
and your eyes ...
it &apos;s a very important period — it &apos;s roughly half the period when we &apos;ve been fully modern humans on the planet .
this is the living conditions on the planet over the last 100,000 years .
on the right , there is a coral .
i work on breast cancer .
we put these two photographs side-by-side on our website , and someone said , &quot; &quot; when i look at the first photo , i ask myself , what was he thinking ?
and karen armstrong , i think you would also say that it was some of your very wounding experiences in a religious life that , with a zigzag , have led to the charter for compassion .
for me , it goes back to the inspiration that i received from my mother .
( applause )
mastery is about sacrificing for your craft and not for the sake of crafting your career .
thank you .
this will be absolutely devastating for global food security .
so that poses very significant challenges for wealthy nations .
( applause )
two of us seeking to change the world can actually make a huge difference .
there &apos;s no need .
they only get to think for the first five minutes .
so the first day we get to new york , my grandmother and i find a penny in the floor of the homeless shelter that my family &apos;s staying in .
and he tells us to pay , but we don &apos;t speak english .
the air ? a brisk -10 with windchill , and i could literally feel the blood trying to leave my hands , feet and face , and rush to protect my vital organs .
now , when it comes to pain , psychologist brock bastian probably said it best when he wrote , &quot; &quot; pain is a kind of shortcut to mindfulness .
well , the first thing you can say , i think with certainty , is what yochai has said already — is there is a great big struggle between those two organizational forms .
it won &apos;t be so clear-cut ; it won &apos;t be microsoft versus linux — there &apos;ll be all sorts of things in between .
you know , was there something actually out there ?
we can never seem to grasp it in its totality .
this article about angelo appeared .
it was covered in concrete to prevent mudslides , and somehow we saw a sort of river in it , and we imagined this river to be a river in japanese style with koi carp swimming upstream .
we thought , it &apos;s cool that we can use software to visualize tiny motions like this , and you can almost think of it as a way to extend our sense of touch .
and it looks like a regular image , but this isn &apos;t an image , and it &apos;s not a video , because now i can take my mouse and i can start interacting with the object .
i don &apos;t know whether this got the biggest cheer , or this , when someone went onto google and saw the front page was like that .
those wires carry 13 thousand amps when the machine is working in full power .
why is it that martin luther king led the civil rights movement ?
their competitors are equally qualified to make all of these products .
so here &apos;s an example : one recent study took two groups of agnostics , that is people who are undecided in their religious beliefs .
i do . i was a young boy , and my grandfather had just died , and i remember a few days later lying in bed at night trying to make sense of what had happened .
but the best part about these components is that we bought them at a toy store .
so i &apos;ll leave you with one of the most compelling facts about this technology and these kinds of vehicles .
one key difference , of course , is we know that there are other planets out there , but so far i &apos;ve only speculated on the possibility that there might be other universes .
maybe each of these shapes is on an equal footing with every other .
so keep looking up , marvel at the ephemeral beauty , and always remember to live life with your head in the clouds .
it was about problems with computer processing over the internet .
and i &apos;m sure you have lots of questions , which i very much look forward to addressing over the next 72 hours , while i &apos;m here . thank you .
but we don &apos;t know if either of those are actually the dark matter candidate , ok .
so obviously , we have a q &amp; a portion of our program , and people line up to mics to ask questions .
the audience members who come and talk to us that night tell us the stories of what it &apos;s like to live in a city with such depleted population .
then you can &apos;t help but make them go &quot; &quot; wow &quot; &quot; ; you can &apos;t help but turn it into a memorable event — you can &apos;t help but turn it into an experience .
is it — you can see behind all of it , and see what is going on in the facades of it .
now , venice , as you know , has a tempestuous relationship with the sea , and is built upon wooden piles .
and it has no dna .

it was invented by farmers in iraq and syria in particular .
( laughter ) we do that in one year .
and because our network is so extensive , each one of our 37 trillion cells gets its own deliveries of oxygen precisely when it needs them .
and now you &apos;ve entered the realm of the mid-water community .
it &apos;s amazing to think that this is actually on earth ; it looks like aliens in an alien environment .
and when you &apos;re outdoors , that type of air has microbes that are commonly associated with plant leaves and with dirt .
but if you look at the blue data points , which is mechanically ventilated air , it &apos;s not as diverse .
that &apos;s why in negotiations , often , when things get tough , people go for walks in the woods .
how could we possibly go to the balcony ?
we all saw the tragedy that happened in boston .
when i look all around here , i see lots of people who would go an extra mile , run an extra mile to save other people , no matter who they are , no matter what religion , no matter who , where they come from .

but for the past 50 years , we &apos;ve run most organizations and some societies along the superchicken model .
i want to use the example of my own country , called uganda , and the kind of structure of incentives that aid has brought there .
sending somebody to school and giving them medicines , ladies and gentlemen , does not create wealth for them .
if we have an international treaty on robotic weapons , how do we gain the benefits of autonomous drones and vehicles while still protecting ourselves against illegal robotic weapons ?

boom , boom , boom , boom , the students were discussing and interacting with each other , and by 4 a.m. that night , i &apos;m totally fascinated , having this epiphany , and by 4 a.m. in the morning , they had discovered the right answer .
that will continue for about two or three weeks , and then we get a test .
but we know what &apos;s happening already , as we go into this information revolution .
you know , but there &apos;s obviously a notion that if you let the inmates of this thing out , that they would snatch a motorist off the street and eat his liver .
this was the winner of an international design award in , i think , 1966 , something like that .
so how can you live little ?
well i &apos;m here to suggest there &apos;s a better way , that less might actually equal more .
this is norwegian forestry commission wood .
( laughter ) what you &apos;re seeing here is a water filtration system .
so what do you think happened to these design students ?
so the average for most people is around 20 inches ; business schools students , about half of that ; lawyers , a little better , but not much better than that , kindergarteners , better than most adults .

two colleagues of mine passed away recently in the crash of a small plane .
well , our vision is to rediscover the spirit of the renaissance , create a new discipline where engineering for cultural heritage is actually a symbol of blending art and science together .

as soon as you win , suddenly stop .
when we analyzed all the news stories and removed just one story , here &apos;s how the world looked .
aside from one-person abc mini-bureaus in nairobi , new delhi and mumbai , there are no network news bureaus in all of africa , india or south america — places that are home to more than two billion people .

but that &apos;s kind of an image from another time , and what &apos;s also outdated are the leadership development programs that are based on success models for a world that was , not a world that is or that is coming .
third question : are you courageous enough to abandon a practice that has made you successful in the past ?
well , you know , we got into this in the beginning as a trade-off , they say , between the wetlands versus the ocean depth .
so i then was invited to go to the gulf in may .
eventually , these innovations will get out and find everyone .
so , i just encourage you , as you are all thinking about the next big thing , as entrepreneurs , as ceos , as engineers , as makers , that you think about the unintended consequences of the things that you &apos;re building , because the real innovation is in finding ways to include everyone .
( applause )
we don &apos;t need a media company to help do this for us .
&apos;cause all i ever had — redemption songs .
&apos;cause all i ever had — redemption songs .
treetop barbie is a great example of that .
i saw the power of duke &apos;s song with urban youth — an audience , you know , i as a middle-aged professor , i don &apos;t have a hope of getting to — in terms of convincing them of the importance of wildlands .

there is a program that some of you might have heard of .

this is what english text looks like at a binary level .
so what happened ?
eleven thousand people came — more than that .
you may know this from the media , but what you may not know is that the average age of the afghan people is 17 years old , which means they grow up in such an environment and — i repeat myself — in 30 years of war .
from afar , they look alien-like , but when you look closer , they &apos;re all made out of black garbage bags or tupperware containers .
i also liked to make environments for people to explore and play .
this chart is showing the specific micrornas present in this sample and how they reacted over time .
each well of these plates has specific biochemistry that we assign , that is looking for a specific microrna , acting like a trap that closes only when the microrna is present in the sample , and when it does , it will shine with green color .
so go inside these open spaces and make it that people can get inside and use those spaces .
that is great , that means we &apos;re going to have 10 billion minds working together , 10 billion talents together .
the captain waved me over .
so , not exactly what i was hoping for , but off i went — up the stairs , down the hall , past the &apos; real &apos; firefighters , who were pretty much done putting out the fire at this point , into the master bedroom to get a pair of shoes .
my father was a san franciscan .
a six-month stalemate was broken by the 442nd in 32 minutes .
and you see , this is very , very unfortunate because tapirs are extremely important for the habitats where they are found .
in the atlantic forest , we found out that tapirs move through open areas of pastureland and agriculture going from one patch of forest to patch of forest .
a few years ago , planet hunters were sifting through data looking for transits , and they spotted a mysterious signal coming from the star kic 8462852 .

jf : raaaaaah !
you can walk across to another group , if you don &apos;t like your group , etc .
i think i can make a guess now — education is self-organizing system , where learning is an emergent phenomenon .
i think that &apos;s when i wondered : why couldn &apos;t we be a high-performance team as well ?
in the corridor leading from the locker room to the game field , i was walking with silvio , who was holding onto my shoulder , so i could guide him .

and instead of going up to someone and asking them , &quot; &quot; what do you do ? &quot; &quot; ask them , &quot; &quot; so what are your dreams ? &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; what are your broken dreams ? &quot; &quot; you know , &quot; &quot; ted . &quot; &quot; tend to each other &apos;s dreams .

about 10 minutes later the judge said we would take a break .
i start thinking , well , how did that happen ?
and the point i &apos;m making here is that companies like yours , companies like mine have to define a purpose which embraces responsibility and understands that we have to play our part in the communities in which we operate .

i have a little mantra .
i &apos;m going to talk a little bit about one kind of information flow , one kind of flow of people , one kind of flow of capital , and , of course , trade in products and services .

with passion and enthusiasm we pay profound respects to ted for its outstanding humanism , the scope of its principles , for its open and generous promotion of young values .
to become better .
we &apos;re , in a sense , failing to act in the future . we &apos;re purposefully , consciously being laggards .
the one thing we need to do is we have to replace these inefficient incandescent light bulbs , florescent lights , with this new technology of led , led light bulbs .
and it &apos;s spacial modulation — these are the only technical terms , i &apos;m not going into details — but this is how we enabled that light source to transmit data .
habitat would be all about gardens , contact with nature , streets instead of corridors .
this is beijing then , not a single high rise building in beijing or shanghai .

this is the google street view car driving by finding the same parking ticket .
we can empower our citizens to be better partners for government , and it &apos;s not that hard .
now you might say , &quot; &quot; okay , that &apos;s silly . &quot; &quot; well , what if you make the car always say it &apos;s going 20 miles an hour slower than it &apos;s actually going ?

we &apos;d have to run our equipment from petrol power generators .

i &apos;m not sure by that time bombay was there , or delhi was there , or chennai was there , or bangalore was there .
and now we &apos;ve got the digital revolution .
the other reason that we built this is when electricity goes down , this has eight hours of battery left , so you can continue working , you can continue being productive , and let &apos;s just say you are less stressed .
how about artistic beauty ?
isn &apos;t that exhaustively cultural ?
they come to us with a request for a loan .

they are really excelling .
and typically that has meant retiring to the easy chair , or going down to arizona to play golf .
the only thing that they have in common are a set of very small lifestyle habits that they follow ritualistically for most of their lives .
well , how does that building look , typically ?
it is accepted that for such an aim , knowledge creation , interaction among people , face-to-face contact , it &apos;s important , and we agreed on that .

reading textbooks is stressful , but reading does not matter when you feel your story is already written , either dead or getting booked .
it &apos;s that little gene . it &apos;s small and it &apos;s mean .
and as for outsiders , white , black or brown , tar and feather them , and whip them out of town .
one idea , one world , one market .
it means that we extended cooperation across national boundaries ; we made the world more cooperative .
this is the hard one , the one that isn ’ t obvious . that ’ s why i leave it to the end .

( laughter ) dr. gero is a brilliant but slightly mad scientist in the &quot; &quot; dragonball z : android saga . &quot; &quot; if you look very carefully , you see that his skull has been replaced with a transparent plexiglas dome so that the workings of his brain can be observed and also controlled with light .
so this anatomy suggests that the mushroom bodies have something to do with action choice .
like their predecessors , today &apos;s nomads travel the steel and asphalt arteries of the united states .
( applause )
we kept prototyping , and eventually , we decided we wanted to go to the cave . we were ready .
it &apos;s how we &apos;ve built it that &apos;s really unique .
great person .
i learned about compassion .
a room like this , nonetheless .
i have and i offer a gospel of doubt .
you will have seen this map of the world before .
everywhere has the same density of people on this map .
why is that happening ?
it &apos;s on a server or it &apos;s on a p.c.
henry ford once said , &quot; &quot; i invented nothing new .
guthrie adapted it into &quot; &quot; this land is your land . &quot; &quot; so , bob dylan , like all folk singers , he copied melodies , he transformed them , he combined them with new lyrics which were frequently their own concoction of previous stuff .
stick with the people you know .
but it &apos;s a special kind of social norm , because it &apos;s a social norm that wants to tell us who we can relate to and who we shouldn &apos;t relate to .
and what we &apos;re going to attempt to do with this bread here , again , is to use , in addition to everything we talked about , this bread we &apos;re going to call &quot; &quot; spent grain bread &quot; &quot; because , as you know , bread-making is very similar to beer-making .
a subtle change in temperature — a subtle change in time — it &apos;s all about a balancing act between time , temperature and ingredients . that &apos;s the art of baking .
and then , to have to deal with large groups , say , at the nation-state level , and we had to have mutual non-aggression , or through a series of conflicts , we eventually came to a rough international bargain to largely keep the peace .

and could you imagine that instead of being frightened of each other , that we all just said , &quot; &quot; let &apos;s do this .
and it &apos;s going to take real work to change that .
it &apos;s going to either be win-win or lose-lose for them .
some of your choice of data sets has been criticized .
expropriation is very tempting .
they &apos;re all buying off-the-shelf stuff .
there are many photos of mr. muench that exist .
so i think this should absolutely be a priority .
there was no one there to look at treatment approaches .
there are tanks and police officers arresting every single person there as we speak .
and one of my questions as a child was , why ?
so poor countries are by and large low trust countries .
he said we &apos;re social creatures , so we share the emotions of others .
but now the question is : how do you make it flow under and over in a piece of paper ?
so , the program that we &apos;re involved in is something which we call diagnostics for all , or zero-cost diagnostics .
there &apos;s a counterintuitive trend that we noticed in these numbers . so let &apos;s look at the first metric here , overwintering survival .
so my research focuses on ways to make bees healthier .
you know , i &apos;ll do a julia childs here .
that encodes ; that will now copy . from one comes two , and then from two comes three .
( video ) ( ringing ) old man : placenta control .
it &apos;s a compound that &apos;s found in polycarbonate plastic , which is what baby bottles are made out of .
it &apos;s what he calls the seven stages of a mythic adventure .
that &apos;s interesting .
you need to survey all feet and extract the principles of how they work .
it uses that beautiful distributed foot to make it as if those obstacles are not even there — truly extraordinary .
that &apos;s my view from my window outside of santa cruz , in bonny doon , just 35 miles from here .
i cherish the future .
interesting where it came from .
so get on your knees and repeat it . &quot; &quot; that &apos;s what all religions tell us : &quot; get on you knees and repeat it 10 or 20 or 15 times a day . &quot;
and that is actually for the last 500 years , since its very successful introduction , i must say .
eythor bender : we are ready with our industry partner to introduce this device , this new exoskeleton this year .
which is why , in the end , i shall always be grateful for this curious love of history , allowing me to spend a lifetime looking back into the past .
( laughter ) so i finally learned you had to tell a story from beginning to middle to end .
( punch ) oops , let me play that again . ( punch )
contemplation , meditation , being deep in thought .
i &apos;ve been so privileged in my life to know extraordinary leaders who have chosen to live lives of immersion .
they said they would try so hard to remember the fragments of the dance , hoping that others were alive and doing the same .
what we have to do is treat critical thinking with respect and be inspired by examples like the health media collaboratory , and as they say in the superhero movies , let &apos;s use our powers for good .
so many years ago , you may remember that former president ronald reagan was very criticized for making a statement that facts are stupid things .
it &apos;s not such a leap of faith to take that that pearl earring actually belongs to his wife .
she &apos;s gorgeous . she obviously loves him . she &apos;s conflicted .
( laughter ) and you didn &apos;t even notice it happened .
( laughter ) but i &apos;m also a famous minor television personality and an avid collector of design within reach catalogs , so i pretty much know everything there is .
so how does this work ?
they were memorizing the names of dozens and dozens and dozens of strangers .
it &apos;s a very natural sense .
1917 . this is the time when we all assume that everything somehow in terms of writing was perfect because the people on &quot; &quot; downton abbey &quot; &quot; are articulate , or something like that .
it has to be absolutely convenient , that &apos;s me going into the pub .
identity is , especially when you &apos;re a teenager , a fluid thing .
we &apos;re the ones who have to do it .
so the scene : the sky is filled with this fleet of helicopters carrying him in .
when you pump gas , you really don &apos;t think you &apos;re using the internet .
but people won &apos;t decide to do it until they recognize the need for it , and that &apos;s the problem that we have right now .
one thing that kept me sane while i was in solitary confinement was reading .
that automatically arrests and tries 16- to 17-year-olds as adults .
then can you tell me what wrong is ?
there &apos;s the punk on the ground , puddle of blood .
where it comes from is an organization called the young foundation , which , over many decades , has come up with many innovations in education , like the open university and things like extended schools , schools for social entrepreneurs , summer universities and the school of everything .
we started with two schools .
that &apos;s an awful lot of women when you multiply by the number of women who were diagnosed with this osteopenia .
he got traded a couple of times , he ended up in the minors for most of his career , and he actually ended up in management . he ended up as a general manager of the oakland a &apos;s .
we &apos;re either all losers or we all can be winners .
and it wasn &apos;t just those who had participated directly .
bl : ok , so we &apos;re going to emotionally navigate .
bl : thanks .
we work hard at x to make it safe to fail .
and now those propellers that lifted it up have become flying turbines .
but what ’ s interesting about the guttenberg bible , and the dawn of this technology , is not the book .
this is an original page of a guttenberg bible .
so we had to design in a context that we knew almost nothing about , except one thing : it would all be about verticality .
so institutions could shrink or contract , as , of course , the future of culture is , in a way , the most uncertain of all .
this is a small modular reactor .
and these reactors run at 600 to 700 degrees celsius , which means the higher the temperature you go to , thermodynamics tells you that you will have higher efficiencies .
it &apos;s not just about the amazonas , or indeed about rainforests .
the reason this is happening boils down , in my mind , to one basic problem , which is our inability to perceive the difference between public benefits and private profits .
and we knew nothing about going to space .
they come with their own money . they &apos;re easy to make .
or you can pull them up where you want them .
and this was another thing that i felt , while not nearly as romantic as cary grant , nevertheless begins to grab a little bit of aesthetic operation , aesthetic performance into a product .
now the things that relate to it are swirling around .
and it started to make me think a lot about the night sky , and how humans have always used the night sky to project their great stories .
girls .
i feel a lot of fear that you may think about and talk to women this way . &quot; &quot; and he surprised me by saying , &quot; you know what ? you &apos;re right . i apologize . &quot;
if the only thing that money determined was access to yachts or fancy vacations or bmws , then inequality wouldn &apos;t matter very much .
all right , what about that ?
the system keeps going unless something negative happens , and one species that i study makes circuits in the trees of foraging ants going from the nest to a food source and back , just round and round , unless something negative happens , like an interaction with ants of another species .
we have a lot to learn from them .
how are people actually going to use this ?
so , really , i want to design for outcomes .
they then used the 68 african-american organizations that criss-crossed the city to distribute those leaflets by hand .
they have a point .
remarkably — no , miraculously — he lived .
from all outward appearances , john had everything going for him .
i had really interesting friends and colleagues , i had a nice apartment on park avenue and 20th street .
i was once fortunate enough to drive into the high , dark mountains behind los angeles , where the great poet and singer and international heartthrob leonard cohen was living and working for many years as a full-time monk in the mount baldy zen center .
not only are there theoretical fixes ; those fixes have been tried .
bueno .
in other words , for t.b. you have to find somebody who has active t.b. who is infecting other people .
and my last assignment there was to run a unit called intervention development , which was responsible for designing interventions .
now , i live in new york city . i &apos;m a songwriter .
( video ) ( music ) tori murden mcclure : hi . it &apos;s sunday , july 5 .
and i want to thank her today .
thank you .
they &apos;re failed states .
cotton : uzbekistan is the second biggest exporter of cotton on earth .
( laughter ) &quot; the impossibility of february &quot; is that february &apos;s a really wretched month in new york and the images for me conjure up these really awful things .
they &apos;re not . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) so it stayed in , and it was , and , you know , it was a good thing .
everything we know is made of some combination of what you see depicted here .
we start here with our workhorse one watt-hour cell .
why don &apos;t you let your family stay home , because you do know that you get a 30-day leave .
i jumped in my car . i went downtown and knocked on the door .
we sent two orbiters and two landers in the summer of 1976 .
water is the key ingredient in the evolution , the origin of life on a planet .
the voice says , &quot; &quot; go away . &quot; &quot; after many years of training , of disciplining , of search and struggle , he comes back .
this is also expressed in biblical vocabulary when we are taught that we were created in the divine image .
it &apos;s a wax-like substance with a melting point of human body temperature , 37 degrees celsius .
we plan to launch this product in india in 2010 , and the target price point will be 25 dollars , less than 0.1 percent of the cost of a traditional incubator .
( applause )
the g8 nations have been incredibly generous on polio over the last 20 years , but we &apos;re starting to have something called polio fatigue and that is that the donor nations aren &apos;t willing to fund polio any longer .
but you don &apos;t feel them , because the weak force is correctly named — very short range and very weak , so they just fly through you .
so , the electromagnetic force , the force that holds us together , gets stronger as you go to higher temperatures .
and so we did this show , and for those of you who , you know , who haven &apos;t seen it , or don &apos;t know it , i can show you this one little clip from the pilot , just to show you some stuff that we did .
rives is here , and i met him years ago at a book fair ; he does pop-up books .
today , i &apos;d like to show you something which came out of these collaborations .
all right . let &apos;s try this .
now , you should know that at that time , the textile industry in the south was notoriously segregated .
and then resumed the beating .
our heritage is much more than our collective memory — it &apos;s our collective treasure .
and here , this is a fly-through the cloud of points of tikal , and here you see it rendered and photo-textured with the photography that we take of the site .
the uses and abuses of this technology aren &apos;t limited to the united states .
i think this poses a serious civil liberties threat .
it &apos;s the best meal ever .
it means &quot; &quot; upside-down . &quot; &quot; you cook it with rice and chicken , and you flip it upside-down .
consider the spartans .
and this x-ray is specific in its wavelength to the atom that it hits .
how can that happen ?
everything is grist for the mill — except hem lengths .
jb : it &apos;s so powerful . richard ford , who &apos;s won the pulitzer prize , says that dyslexia helped him write sentences .
julie burstein : isn &apos;t that a wonderful story ?
that is quite sufficient for most of our conservation applications .
this , for example , is a pair of rhinoceros taking a cooling bath on a hot summer day in the lowlands of nepal .
and they happen to be a very good vehicle for carrying oceanographic equipment .
i think donne wrote a poem about that .
so that &apos;s a chunk of what we &apos;re looking for .
now rather than just argue about this number , a copyright mathematician will analyze it and he &apos;ll soon discover that this money could stretch from this auditorium all the way across ocean boulevard to the westin , and then to mars ...
as it comes out of the grinder , you just have a little tray , and you just take it off in little passes , build it up , slice it vertically .
you don &apos;t have to heat them up as hot as you would something you do pressure canning because bacterial spores can &apos;t grow in the acid .
so , the new festival , it asks the audience to play an essential role in shaping the performance .
sydney , as i would learn , is a city of suburbs , and minto lies southwest , about an hour away .
however , the best current treatment available anywhere in the world is often very difficult to provide in developing countries .
i didn &apos;t bother to ask her what the results of the trial were because it seemed obvious to me that she would have no clue .
eventually , california produced too much food to ship fresh , so it became critical to market canned and frozen foods .
it is about food , but it &apos;s not about cooking , per se .
but we certainly don &apos;t want them to , nor is it in their best interest .
he can see it &apos;s worth 103,000 dollars — frankly , a modest collection .
putting a few cameras in the classroom and saying that things are being recorded on an ongoing basis is very practical in all public schools .
because the road map to get rid of this disease involves many things .
it &apos;s the total brain experience , we &apos;re going to ...
( laughter ) and something ... good luck with that one in the japanese translation room . ( laughter )
and basically we took hay and crab apples and made barbecue sauce out of those two ingredients .
as long as it &apos;s good for you and good for the environment , it doesn &apos;t matter .
no wonder you rise in the middle of the night to look up the date of a famous battle in a book on war .
of course , there will be time for all that later in your life , after you come out of your room and begin to blossom , or at least pick up all your socks .
this is an average-size greenlandic iceberg .
that &apos;s about a 15-foot boat .
to say ahh , if this happens then we are going to have a pandemic ?
the government says the federal responsibility will basically be about trying to keep the virus out , which we all know is impossible , and then to mitigate the impact primarily on our economy .
( laughter ) and rick warren &apos;s kind of pulling ahead , kind of pulling ahead .
then portuguese to pig latin .
it has been done in uganda and other countries , and what is most powerful is that the images have been picked by the media and amplified across the country , across the continent .
do you know why you were born ?
i am going . those who want to come , i welcome you to come along with me .
we encourage them to bring children .
and the one that is worse is the one where pain was at its peak at the very end ; it &apos;s a bad story .
you can know how satisfied somebody is with their life , and that really doesn &apos;t teach you much about how happily they &apos;re living their life , and vice versa .
e : &#91; laser noise &#93; ( laughter ) sw : yeah , yeah . that was pretty funny , einstein .
sw : there you go . and , of course , if all else fails , you can just run off and enjoy a fun fiesta .
thank you very much , ladies and gentlemen .
( music ) so every noise you can hear there is my voice .
a trivial example is this : newton found the law of gravity , which goes like one over the square of the distance between the things gravitated .
the human mind can arise from neurobiology and a lot of accidents , the way the chemical bond arises from physics and certain accidents .
apart from all those products , the forest is very important for climate regulation .
maybe this is completely disconnected , as we just learned by having deforestation come down .
and in the igala-speaking part of nigeria , the plant is known as a kp &apos;iye kp &apos;oma , and when you hear that , you think of death .
see , i &apos;m a computer scientist by background and not someone in the creative arts .
for most suicidal folks , or those contemplating suicide , they wouldn &apos;t think of hurting another person .
kevin decided on his own that day to come back over that rail and give life another chance .
but before i got to him , i was so lost .
oh , for the love of god .
and so these are questions like , &quot; how can a democracy balance freedom and security ? &quot;
so this person &apos;s making different faces , and it &apos;s actually drawing forth different objects from the collection that connect with exactly how she &apos;s looking .
when you leave the opera house , you &apos;ll find there &apos;s braille signage in the lifts .
i &apos;ve indeed been a very fortunate human being .
and don &apos;t even get me started on the confined animal feeding operations called cafos .
little kids , especially , are attracted by colorful packaging and plastic toys .
so what could possibly change this terrible gap that has opened up in the world today ?
and i feel like this whole evening has been very amazing to me .
teruo kurosaki , who owns a furniture company called idee , he asked me to ship him two trailers to tokyo .
it &apos;s got a huge couch , fits quite a few people , and basically we &apos;d had a great time with this .
i think .
it sometimes acts without knowing everything it has to know .
the amount of data we &apos;re getting about the brain from neuroscience is doubling every year .
no other species has done that .
she had to impersonate a man .
so we are working now on a non-invasive — again , these are all invasive studies .
as my fellow athlete and global messenger john franklin stephens wrote in an open letter to a political pundit who used the r-word as an insult , &quot; &quot; come join us someday at special olympics .
people use it as a casual term or an insult .
but my elephant in the living room flies .
wipe it up , throw it away .
so that would be a good place to start .
the us constitution needs women .
you see 4,000 representative species , and you can see where we are .
and we see a drift towards complexity that &apos;s very intuitive .
they &apos;re clinging to a rock face and actually scraping bacteria off that rock face .
and then there &apos;s earthquakes , and then volcanic eruptions , on the order of one every five years , that completely wipes the area out .
and finally , this bionic structure , which is covered by a transparent biopolymer membrane , will really change radically how we look at aircrafts in the future .
today , we know that this future vision didn &apos;t come true .
first of all , take the marker and go ahead and sign the bill .
( laughter ) ( applause ) ( laughter ) sir , this is not your show . ( laughter )
we want to know about dynamic things going around .
the camera is actually tracking all your gestures .
over one billion people use birth control without any hesitation at all .
now , as a mother , what do i want the very most for my children ?
this process is an engineering problem , a mechanical problem , a logistical problem , an operational problem .
the freshness , the capacity . i can turn this image .
i know how you feel . &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; i hope that you will have the strength to do what i did .
and whatever we do to the web , we do to ourselves . &quot; &quot; now that &apos;s compassion .
if everything worked as planned tonight , i used my ability to vocalize sound to be coupled to your brains .
now , let &apos;s take all this information together and ask : how can we use it to transmit a memory that i have from my brain to your brains ?
it shows role models to young men and women about fitness and about life that i would argue help create security for us .
another aspect of this partnership is in disaster relief .
and so when i met with three children from the schools , who had traveled all day to come to bogota , one of the three children brought her mother .
so we &apos;re once again doing &quot; &quot; give one , get one . &quot; &quot; last year , we ran a &quot; &quot; give one , get one &quot; &quot; program , and it generated over 100,000 laptops that we were then able to give free .
by 7 : 08 , i started to black out .
i &apos;m six foot one , and fat .
one said to me , &quot; &quot; our people used to gather in cafes to watch football &quot; &quot; — or soccer , as we say in america — &quot; and now they gather to watch parliament . &quot;
where women agree , however , is on their own role , and that it must be central and active .
( laughter ) ffl : we haven &apos;t taught art 101 to the computers .
they do not carry meaning in themselves .
by 2030 , we will have as many as 50 such megacity clusters in the world .
as a rule of thumb , we should spend about one trillion dollars on the basic infrastructure needs of every billion people in the world .
when i was in elementary school , my next door neighbor , he gave me a book for my birthday .
now , there &apos;s a funny thing going on here .
i will show how the capillary action works , how it feeds , i &apos;ll be able to get all the cells inside that stem .
and getting a hold of that was extremely difficult and laborious .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m hopeful .
and they &apos;re here for a reason .
there was a big decline in coffee prices .
if people have no incentive to avoid aids on their own , even if they know everything about the disease , they still may not change their behavior .
it starts with maybe a simple low iq in a rat or mouse , and maybe there &apos;s more in a chimpanzee , and then maybe there &apos;s more in a stupid person , and then maybe an average person like myself , and then maybe a genius .
we &apos;re in the first hour of the internet .
and that &apos;s clearer now than it &apos;s been for decades .
you know , this is a low point in the respect for business .
it &apos;s also morbidity .
you &apos;ll hear more about this in a few minutes .
we encouraged him to improvise .
and then this is what we called the &quot; &quot; dead head , &quot; &quot; no reference to jerry garcia .
and i visited it with several ladies , and asked all sorts of questions of the director .
in my shop where i studied , or learned , there was a traditional hierarchy of master , journeyman and learned worker , and apprentice , and i worked as the apprentice .
( video ) boy : hey listen ! did you know that the stocks are up ?
they make a lot of money .
i &apos;ve seen inside my brain . you will too , soon .
if we can look at the activation in the brain that &apos;s producing the pain , we can form 3d models and watch in real time the brain process information , and then we can select the areas that produce the pain .
they couldn &apos;t stop talking about all the things they did in 1950 , all the things they were planning to do in 1950 , all the dreams of what they wanted to accomplish in 1950 .
as of about six months ago , the state of the art in this field is that you would , for instance , go up to the following psychologist with fabulous hair , and you &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; steve , you &apos;re an expert on the irregular verbs .
a list , though , would last .
&quot; he felt his own age , forty-four ... &quot;
signs of their outrage ...
that &apos;s the story of thousands of people .
the purpose of this project is , one : i hate not remembering things that i &apos;ve done in the past .
i was on a three-month road trip this summer .
now , this — using counting to compute and build these kinds of things by this kind of developmental process is something that also has bearing on craig venter &apos;s question .
so it &apos;s got some errors , but at least it counts up .
okay . you see that ?
( music ) ( laughter ) yeah .
so , on this side , you get out your coins , and you toss and toss and toss .
how could that be ?
and do you realize that almost all of those are due to human error and not machine error , and can therefore be prevented by machines ?
when i turned 18 , i lost my best friend to a car accident .
it &apos;s kind of a passion that comes from doing the best and having flow while you &apos;re working .
but this little excerpt is a very good summary of what he was saying during the interview .
count dracula teeth in the mouths of your neighbors ?
it &apos;s this brain which makes this reflex .
what i &apos;m about to show you is a diabetic ulcer .
this is the complete antithesis of regenerative medicine .
planetary systems outside our own are like distant cities whose lights we can see twinkling , but whose streets we can &apos;t walk .
but really , every measurement it makes is precious , because it &apos;s teaching us about the relationship between stars and planets , and how it &apos;s really the starlight that sets the stage for the formation of life in the universe .
there &apos;s no more relationship there .
nothing pulls people together like a common threat or a common attack , especially an attack from a foreign enemy , unless of course that threat hits on our polarized psychology , in which case , as i said before , it can actually pull us apart .
don &apos;t do that .
i took all these paintings back to my studio , and scraped them , and carved into them , and poured paint thinner on them , put more paint on top , drew on them .
all of science is like this .
and beautiful mathematical explanations are not only for our pleasure .
( applause )
some of those reforms have been good .
it &apos;s a lot harder than you might think .
look , i lied to the feds . i lost a year of my life from it .
but this is the kind of thing that a wide variety of dna for this animal is available in the frozen zoo .
so if he &apos;s successful , she won &apos;t be the last .
we got the temporal lobe so we can actually hear the world .
perk up .
he said , &quot; &quot; what can i do to save the rainforests ? &quot; &quot; i said , &quot; &quot; well , ben , what do you do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; i make ice cream . &quot;
you think that &apos;s not an issue going forward ?
so , since the transistor is so simple , you can put lots of them together .
and you put lots of them together and you come with something called integrated circuits .
there is one simple act of transgression that can rob a couple of their relationship , their happiness and their very identity : an affair .
so my patient fernando , he &apos;s plagued .
so , it &apos;s quite appropriate that this section is called a marketplace .
( applause ) now , this leadership is a far cry from the traditional leaders that africans have known for centuries .
you might want to get some chocolate in .
so now it &apos;s great because now we have this texture , and we can add numbers to it as well .
the programmers come and go .
the scientific revolution wasn &apos;t created by the printing press .
and the bubble is 153 ft .
it would have the interdisciplinarity of the ted conference .
it was absolutely amazing when she picked it up to safety , protecting it from the hyena .
but i have to tell you — everybody always asks , &quot; &quot; what happened to the baby baboon ? &quot; &quot; it did die , and we suspect it was from the freezing winter nights .
if you do lose a lot of weight , you become hungry , and your muscles burn less energy .
children are especially vulnerable to this cycle of dieting and then binging .
so , embryonic stem cells are really incredible cells .
it really has brought us to the threshold of personalized medicine .
♫ if there are noises ♫ ♫ in the night ♫ eric whitacre : i was thunderstruck .
( video ) soprano : ♫ upon my pillow ♫ ♫ safe in bed ♫ ew : that &apos;s georgie from england . she &apos;s only nine .
but the thing that really struck me , when i plotted all this data , and it was a lot of numbers , was that you can see how it levels off .
it &apos;s unscientific . it &apos;s unnecessary .
let &apos;s do some mathy thing , and with luck it &apos;ll work out the answer and try and tell us some interesting things things about related math .
it &apos;s really a very deep , very powerful , very fundamental idea , whose effects we &apos;ve only just begun to see .
you might be surprised to know that these simple drawings are the only way that most biologists visualize their molecular hypotheses .
and i &apos;m working on a new project now called &quot; &quot; the science of hiv &quot; &quot; where i &apos;ll be animating the entire life cycle of the hiv virus as accurately as possible and all in molecular detail .
fortunately , i had and continue to have an absolutely wonderful team of colleagues and collaborators in my own team , and that &apos;s the only way that this work can really occur .
we stop for a drink of water .
but all he wanted was to just live a comfortable life , like other people .
so here i am sleeping on the airplane heading up to alaska .
you might look at michigan and say , we &apos;re going to lead the nation in producing the guts for the electric vehicle , like the lithium ion battery .
i was elected in 2002 and , at the end of my first year in office in 2003 , i got a call from one of my staff members , who said , &quot; &quot; gov , we have a big problem .
i don &apos;t think of myself as a mental health activist .
i &apos;m the ceo of dosomething.org.
and as i looked at our global economy , i realized it too is that system , but it &apos;s a system that effectively can &apos;t run in the long term .
we were eking things out a bit longer .
today , this number is more than 30 percent and it will grow to more than 50 percent by 2030 .
the hospital &apos;s maternity ward was really stressed out because a lot of babies were born on this gray november day .
and in addition , we &apos;ve actually used polarizers on all the lights — just like polarized sunglasses can block the glare off of the road , polarizers can block the shine off of the skin , so we don &apos;t get all those specular reflections to take this map .
we can turn the volume up a little bit if that &apos;s available .
we &apos;ve got increasing market stalls selling local food , and in a survey that local students did for us , 49 percent of all food traders in that town said that their bottom line had increased because of what we were actually doing .
so , back to the public meeting . ( laughter ) we put that proposition to the meeting , two seconds , and then the room exploded .
in this way — ( laughter ) in this way , i actually started to learn about nature .
( applause )
it &apos;ll be millions of times more powerful than it is today .
one has one that actually walks with a surprisingly human-like gait , that &apos;s built out of molecules .
and some of them don &apos;t .
and women can be heroes , too .
wind takes about two to five years on average , same as concentrated solar and photovoltaics .
and this is just the co2 from the life cycle .
&quot; &quot; it &apos;s magic , &quot; &quot; some of us say .
well , it &apos;s neither .
so obviously , we can do better , and we want to do better , and we &apos;re all trying to be green .
now that &apos;s one thing , of course .
what we really need is something to replace the automobile for those 50-plus mile trips .
if one of those fails , you still have a second chance .
and they had already started building the sewers in london , and they immediately went to this outbreak and they told everybody to start boiling their water .
and the map is actually a little bit bigger .
they are frustrated as hell with it , but they &apos;re not complaining about it , they &apos;re fixing it .
and this has spread just frictionlessly , organically , naturally .
i wanted to talk to you today about creative confidence .
bandura &apos;s 86 and he still works at stanford .
so here we are .
you can see an image of one of these corals behind me .
i want to be independent .
that &apos;s the moment my innovation journey began .
we have three different strains of agarikon mushrooms highly active against flu viruses .
our team — and we have a team of experts that go out — we went out 20 times in the old-growth forest last year .
and people come to visit to see if they can identify a picture they &apos;ve lost or help somebody else get the photos back to them that they might be desperately searching for .
they can be shocking or silly or soulful .
you can put a knob in between and now you &apos;ve made a little dimmer .
let me show you how they work .
so , how could we make better sense about this ?
and it is the dhs that makes it possible to know this .
ue : usually i &apos;m wearing a helmet . in the mountains i &apos;m always wearing a helmet because of landings — usually it &apos;s difficult — it &apos;s not like regular skydiving where you have like the big landings .
jc : ah , i see . so the wingsuit is set up to deliberately release smoke so that you can be tracked . one more question .
when they leave the institution , they find it really difficult to cope and to integrate into society .
the older children bully the little ones . they learn to survive . they learn to defend themselves , or they go under .
&quot; &quot; i &apos;m a local of lagos and berlin , &quot; &quot; suggests overlapping experiences , layers that merge together , that can &apos;t be denied or removed .
&quot; &quot; r &quot; &quot; number two , relationships .
and that &apos;s a really fascinating thing about this approach .
now , before i talk more about that technology , let &apos;s have a quick look at what human characters look like at the moment in computer games .
so , we begin by building the cores .
one , it is the lateral stability for the entire building ; it &apos;s a structural element .
and within that context , we can offer the kids time — something that seems in short supply in their over-scheduled lives .
our goal is to ensure that they leave with a better sense of how to make things than when they arrived , and the deep internal realization that you can figure things out by fooling around .
so we are four of us in four corners of the world .
my family , in my city , and almost in the country , was unique .
i said , &quot; &quot; what do you want to do ? &quot; &quot; he slapped me on the knee and said , &quot; &quot; i want to go fishing . &quot; &quot; i said , &quot; &quot; that , i know how to do . &quot; &quot; harold went fishing the next day .
we spend 10 times more on these patients than the second-leading country in the world .
and if you think about it , all of the weird weather we &apos;ve been having the last few years , much of that is due to just one degree warming , and we need co2 emissions to peak by the end of this decade globally and then come down .
and why not take control of it ourselves ?
only , i believe , for a lack of imagination .
it &apos;s not just that you &apos;ll never lose your wallet or your keys anymore , or your child when you &apos;re at disneyland .
the user actually has to push that button to get their hot water boiled , which means , because we &apos;re all lazy , you only fill exactly what you need .
but the crisper drawers , they &apos;re just a drawer with a slightly better seal .
now you get it .
( applause )
iw : so to all the kids of this beautiful but challenging world : go for it !
so we looked into what was a realistic target for us kids : plastic bags .
then connect the power . finally , the yellow ethernet cable .
mm : okay . so , i &apos;m told we &apos;re ready , which means we can now point at the image , and there you all are .
so , as she mentioned , that is overstated for sure , but that &apos;s why they called me the godfather of modern street skating .
in fact , winning isn &apos;t the word , i won it once .
thank you very much .
and if you look at these figures for the more developed markets like u.k. , germany , and so on , they &apos;re actually much lower .
but a huge difference between afghanistan and sri lanka .
here in uganda , development aid .
real security is not only being able to tolerate mystery , complexity , ambiguity , but hungering for them and only trusting a situation when they are present .
i was in sri lanka , for example , three days after the tsunami , and i was standing on the beaches and it was absolutely clear that , in a matter of five minutes , a 30-foot wave could rise up and desecrate a people , a population and lives .
but i am very excited to be here right now , so i am just trying to remind myself that , you know , like , the purpose of being here and everything , i mean , trying to answer these questions , it is very exciting .
i don &apos;t know what to call myself now , because i have really my chinese identity , but my kids , they are american-chinese , but it &apos;s difficult to try to express myself in front of audience of people like this .
cancer organizations and the drive for early screening and cancer awareness and cancer research have normalized cancer , and this is a wonderful thing .
you should be immune .
are you read for this ?
so i think what we &apos;ve learned is that the risks from this money creation scheme are quite modest , but the benefits are potentially huge .
in the u.k. , we have a strong public health message on five fruit and vegetables a day and how much exercise we should do — never my best thing .
and not only that , we need to create a great transition to get there , and we need to pave that great transition with good things .
it was the idea of isolating the tactile component of sculpture , and then putting it into a communication system .
it has buckminster fuller &apos;s dymaxion map edited here .
i &apos;ve been a huge fan of enterprise and entrepreneurship since 1993 .
when life brought about a series of death and near-death experiences within my close circle , which highlighted the need for an emergency medical response service in india , similar to 911 in usa .
and when you desire , how is it different ?
give me predictability , give me surprise .
my husband &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; honey , deception ?
it &apos;s the only asymmetrical expression .
it used to cost millions and millions of dollars to sequence genes .
it &apos;s not bad , but it &apos;s very different , and i think that the traditional rules that we have for institutions don &apos;t work anymore , and most of us here operate with a different set of principles .
witness .
at that moment , they fired and shot off my fingers .
there were several — several of these items were disappointments .
there &apos;s not much of it left .
we &apos;ve surrendered our power , trading off our discomfort with uncertainty for the illusion of certainty that they provide .
we &apos;ve become addicted to their certainty , their assuredness , their definitiveness , and in the process , we have ceded our responsibility , substituting our intellect and our intelligence for their supposed words of wisdom .
often the roofs are broken , so you don &apos;t have enough darkness in the classroom to do these things .
so what we did was that we converted this device into a medical device .
i &apos;ll go very quickly .
you &apos;re not totally in control , but you &apos;re changing the underlying rules in interesting ways because you have an end result which is maybe a more democratic spread of voices .
we can do that .
the fact is , you can do it all with one towel .
it was complex , but there was something capricious about its complexity .
he who seeks gratification shall be disappointed .
my guess that even in the front row , you can &apos;t see that .
it also involves chile .
there &apos;s no damage outside .
this doesn &apos;t cause any damage .
this process requires extraordinary precautions .
they have to dig themselves out every day .
but of course , we &apos;ve spread to every corner of the globe and in arctic canada , where i live , we have perpetual daylight in summer and 24 hours of darkness in winter .
and in summer , it &apos;s almost manic hunting and working activity very long hours , very active .
one , don &apos;t listen to career advisers .
and when we think that the major ideological conflicts that we inherited were all based around this question of who should control the means of production , and these technologies are coming back with a solution : actually , maybe no one . all of us .
the first example is the largest annual community event — where googlers from around the world donate their labor to their local communities — was initiated and organized by three employees before it became official , because it just became too big .
and i hope that compassion will be both fun and profitable for you too .
for here am i floating round my tin can .
... i &apos;m living on . &quot; &quot; david bowie , 1947-2016 &#93; ( applause )
when you have a patent , you can exclude anyone else from making , from producing or making low-cost versions , for example , available of those medications .
this is as a result of the intellectual property rules of the world trade organization .
this is a back step pivot .
and i tried to come up for air , and my lower back hit the bottom of the inner tube .
the biggest , darkest nodes are the busiest nodes .
oh good , she &apos;s over there eating her huckleberries .
because we are on to something special .
so , in the lower you see the greenlab obviously , and on the right hand side you &apos;ll see algae .
wild boar , lynx , moose , they &apos;ve all returned to the region in force , the very real , very negative effects of radiation being trumped by the upside of a mass exodus of humans .
now radiation or not , these women are at the end of their lives .
hannah initially just feels like dealing with what happened on her own .
thank you .
and i want you to think about the community that you want to be part of creating .
and as i do that , i &apos;m not going to dwell much on the very large philanthropy that everybody already knows about — the gates or the soros or the google .
thank you very much .
in fact , often , just launching the straw man of a service can teach you what people really want .
and the question i get when i start talking about this most often is , &quot; what made you interested in this subject ? &quot;
when i go to parties , it doesn &apos;t usually take very long for people to find out that i &apos;m a scientist and i study sex .
so you can make something like a game controller , and then the system will understand what shape it &apos;s in and change to that mode .
so when we &apos;re working together in person , i &apos;m not only looking at your face but i &apos;m also gesturing and manipulating objects , and that &apos;s really hard to do when you &apos;re using tools like skype .
the main point is that , if we continue to look at education as if it &apos;s about coming to school to get the information and not about experiential learning , empowering student voice and embracing failure , we &apos;re missing the mark .
i asked them to take the examples that we were seeing of the info-graphics that existed in a lot of mass media , and take a look at what were the interesting components of it , and produce one for themselves of a different man-made disaster from american history .
and i believe that what will be built at ground zero will be meaningful , will be inspiring , will tell other generations of the sacrifices , of the meaning of this event .
radical , what does it mean ? it &apos;s something which is rooted , and something which is rooted deep in a tradition .
you destroy all the bone marrow in the cancer patient with massive doses of chemotherapy , and then you replace that marrow with several million healthy marrow cells from a donor .
if you fight against that pain , you just create more pain , and you block what wants to be born .
this is really cool . &quot; &quot; and so , i really got bitten by the bug of deep-ocean exploration .
since then , in the intervening 40 years , i &apos;ve spent about 3,000 hours underwater , and 500 hours of that was in submersibles .
we witnessed the eruption of violence in the streets .
was what was happening in ghana a metaphor for what was happening in me ?
and that was what i did .
and the reason was because of overfishing , and the fact that a last common grazer , a sea urchin , died .
i believe we need to bring the humanitarian world from analog to digital .
it is a user-appropriate technology that has been used for humanitarian good to great effect .
i use natural reed , because natural reed has a lot of tension in it that i cannot fully control .
and then i compile all of these numbers on these clipboards that you see here .
and old lady ran to the door and say , &quot; &quot; who is it ? &quot; &quot; jack say , &quot; &quot; me , mama-san , could we spend the night here ?
and the song began to move on i understand like this .
look at this hiv patient down here , zinny .
years after he &apos;s had these drugs , i learned that everything he did to manage his excess saliva , including some positive side effects that came from other drugs , were making his constipation worse .
we just think of the weather , and even with the weather , we don &apos;t think of all the many nuances of weather .
( music ) elderly man : you think this is just another day in your life ?
but right now , depression is society &apos;s deep cut that we &apos;re content to put a band-aid over and pretend it &apos;s not there .
so you would say i wasn &apos;t depressed , you would say i wasn &apos;t suicidal , but you would be wrong .
we have serial monogamy .
25 years it took .
because you have to chuck out masses and masses of it , hoping that your sex cells , your male sex cells , which are held within the pollen , will somehow reach another flower just by chance .
and that &apos;s the sort of thing that it would be seeing .
and the if-then model is : if this happens , then we will be happy .
and the way we learn to be unhappy is by buying into a particular mental model .
i looked at the clouds , and i did what is hardest of all for me to do usually , which is nothing at all .
but for the fortunate among us , i think the age of movement brings exhilarating new possibilities .
this is what i saw . i saw hills and valleys .
imagine trying to make friends covered with razor-sharp poisonous barbs .
so first of all , i &apos;d like to say something about memetics and the theory of memes , and secondly , how this might answer questions about who &apos;s out there , if indeed anyone is .
and 100 pages later .
and this is happening right now , today .
so they rightly regarded this drug as a failure , and its commercial development was stopped , and because its commercial development was stopped , this trial was never published .
sometimes , you get disease organisms that don &apos;t rely on host mobility at all for transmission .
so to me , it &apos;s an experiment that &apos;s waiting to happen , and if it confirms the prediction , then we should have a very powerful tool .
now there is another kind of mirror neuron , which is involved in something quite different .
but it can contemplate the vastness of interstellar space .
and all the owners are adding their cars . it &apos;s really exciting .
hours and hours of sitting with insurers and many companies and their thoughts about risk and how this is totally innovative , they &apos;d never thought of it before .
real invention is happening in these labs .
that &apos;s still conventional bits , the step after that is — this is an earlier prototype in the lab ; this is high-speed video slowed down .
i set out to write a compelling economic story , one that had great characters , that no one else was telling , and one that i thought mattered .
the great news is we already know what works .
and in some cases , oxytocin can even decrease cooperation .
so based on the same logic , i could equally conclude you hate your iphone .
which happens to be my next example .
back in january 2009 , we saw more than two million new tweets each day on the platform .
they call it the oval office .
we know you can do it . we love you . thank you so much .
then i realized , maybe that &apos;s a little bit lofty for now .
but memory is not .
but when you have this idea , you know , what happens to all these ideas ?
so the idea is that the hardware , the software , the design of the object , the fabrication , everything about this project is open-source and you can make it yourself .
over the next 200 years we see the infant christ go from a sitting to a standing position on the virgin &apos;s lap , and then back again .
the rest of the collection remains here , stored in plain brown paper bags until funds can be raised to build a permanent museum and study center .
the success will not come if we &quot; &quot; just , &quot; &quot; quote , unquote , fly around the world in a solar-powered airplane .
i deeply believe that life is a much greater adventure if we manage to do politics without the trench between the left and the right wing .
so we can put people in an mri scanner and have them do a little video game like the one i showed you and look for this signal .
so we &apos;ll start with the hippocampus , shown in yellow , which is the organ of memory .
and as you know , everybody loves that , too .
my first semester in spanish , i got a d.
i can do things like read and write music .
i am a very visual thinker .
they start eating more meat and so on and so forth .
water consumption has increased to 430 liters .
thank you .
in this shot here , where we &apos;re moving up off the ground , i added acceleration .
or as one of my college professors said , &quot; he clutched for the handrail of faith . &quot;
and he collected many things , including his famous finches .
inside it was every single letter he had ever received from visitors from abroad , and on some of them he had pasted little black-and-white worn snapshots of his new foreign friends .
thank you .
it &apos;s the religion where more than 50 percent of the people say that they belong .
i found fertility at birth , and i looked at total fertility rate per woman .
and what i want to talk about is something that compliments both systems .
patient capital requires that we have incredible tolerance for risk , a long time horizon in terms of allowing those entrepreneurs time to experiment , to use the market as the best listening device that we have , and the expectation of below-market returns , but outsized social impact .
people tend to think of prohibition as the ultimate form of regulation when in fact it represents the abdication of regulation with criminals filling the void .
( applause ) but here &apos;s the good news .
do i have to go around the world photographing , excuse me , women between the age of 25 and 30 ? is that what beauty is going to be ?
you have to be quick , because i &apos;m running out of time .
now during this time , the book was the king of storytelling .
( applause )
we have 11 and a half million root apex and a total length of 600 or more kilometers and a very high surface area .
let &apos;s have a look at this short movie now .
so that shows you that we have people who are capable of doing .
in tourism , in many african countries , a great opportunity .
the vote split along lines of age , education , class and geography .
this illustration from the financial times post-brexit is really striking .
the tried-and-true , well-crafted formulas and vocabulary of architecture do not apply here .
we made an air-conditioned , tented bed .
true guilt arises only from an offense against a person , and a down &apos;s is not a person . &quot; &quot; there &apos;s been a lot of ink given to the enormous progress that we &apos;ve made in the treatment of gay people .
and there are people who think that families like mine shouldn &apos;t be allowed to exist .
as this forest grows , it blocks the sunlight .
it could be a flowering forest , a forest that attracts a lot of birds or bees , or it could simply be a native , wild evergreen forest .
it has renewables that it can afford to deploy in germany because it &apos;s rich enough to afford to do it .
now , this is a projection made by men by the actions of society , and it &apos;s ours to change , not to accept .
still , not everyone has this done , or they may develop breast cancer before the middle age recommendation for having a mammogram .
automation is the key to accessibility .
why did nikola tesla have to invent the alternating current that powers the lights in this building or the city that we &apos;re in ?
so , you hear the west talk about innovation at the edge .
and then when i went through that big , horrible breakup with carl and i couldn &apos;t get off the couch , i listened to your song , ♫ &quot; &quot; now that i don &apos;t have you , &quot; &quot; ♫ over and over and over and over again .
i mean , i watch oprah mostly when i &apos;m home in spokane visiting my mother . and to my mother , oprah is a greater moral authority than the pope , which is actually saying something because she &apos;s a devout catholic .
but don &apos;t take my word for it — come with me .
( music ) i &apos;ve visited hundreds of marine locations , but there are a handful of seascapes that have touched me incredibly deeply .
and this work has been wonderful . it &apos;s been great .
physicists sometimes say that we want fundamental laws so simple that we could write them on the front of a t-shirt .
the higgs boson does not share the beauty , the symmetry , the elegance , of the rest of the elementary particle world .
we will find a surprising and intriguing result about our universe , and to explain my point , let me first tell you what the higgs is about , and to do so , we have to go back to one tenth of a billionth of a second after the big bang .
so , for example in iraq , you know , the war zone , there is roadside bombs . currently you send these remotely controlled vehicles that are armed .
we call it the blind driver challenge , very exciting .
this is me being inspired by my first tutor , my mom , and this is me teaching introduction to artificial intelligence to 200 students at stanford university .
now , i &apos;ll show you some of the forums , most of which were self-organized by the students themselves .
i think it is .
they &apos;re easy to be re-adapted .
this question was so compelling that we decided to explore the answer , by building siftables .
most importantly , they &apos;re physical , so like the blocks , you can move them just by reaching out and grasping .
and we need a lot of sunlight in this troubled world .
it was agrarian , and the means of production and political system was called feudalism , and knowledge was concentrated in the church and the nobility .
more than 40 % of earth &apos;s land has been cleared for agriculture .
so without a doubt , agriculture is the single most powerful force unleashed on this planet since the end of the ice age . no question .
no more , &quot; &quot; charge before use . &quot; &quot; so why am i telling you this ?
thank you very much .
and the opportunity to make a whirlwind tour of the world like that is utterly amazing , for lots of reasons .
the majority going to something we call the legacy fund .
it &apos;s about how do you create a new product or develop a new product or manufacture a new product , but not a new product itself ?
for example , in the pharma industry , a lot of the molecules are being developed , but you see a major part of that work is being sent to india .
but of course , mental illnesses can kill in more direct ways as well . the most obvious example is suicide .
now , in order for us to examine the overall impact of a health condition both on life expectancy as well as on the quality of life lived , we need to use a metric called the daly , which stands for a disability-adjusted life year .
( laughter ) that &apos;s the second of the quadruple .
and in stand-up of course , the stand-up comedian is supposed to dominate the audience .
now we &apos;re also about to publish a study — the first study showing you can change gene expression in men with prostate cancer .
and the cardiac pet scan shown on the lower left , the blue means no blood flow .
well , that takes us to 65 .
now , that &apos;s still not good enough , and the world does still have plenty of problems .
and these are always periods , ladies and gentlemen , accompanied by turbulence , and all too often by blood .
collective security is not enough .
as soon as i &apos;m done with this ted talk , i &apos;m going to immediately call my lovely family in seattle .
it &apos;s a phenomenal time to be human .
thank you for putting your hand up over there .
it actually has a level of dexterity in its penis much akin to what we have with our hands .
so every 10 years we do germination tests on every sample of seeds that we have .
fantastically useful plant , both for protein and for medicine .
and there they had a detention camp where alleged vietnamese would be tested , language tested .
in a country of only seven million people , one and a half million were murdered by their own leaders , their bodies piled in the mass graves of the killing fields .
the first one is that in life we encounter many people who , in some way or another , try to tattoo our faces .
what would happen then ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; oh , don &apos;t worry about it , &quot; &quot; he said .
( applause )
you know , in my field , there &apos;s a debate about whether architecture can even do anything to improve social relationships .
for them , nations , countries , boundaries , borders still matter a great deal , and often violently .
six years after the u.s. invasion of iraq , the country still exists more on a map than it does in reality .
the bottom players , you see all the activity in dorsomedial pfc .
you see on the left , when the amount to divide is one , two or three dollars , they disagree about half the time , and when the amount is four , five , six , they agree quite often .
so i thought , &quot; &quot; i wonder what &apos;ll happen if i put the two together ? &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) ( applause ) and the underwater wheelchair that has resulted has taken me on the most amazing journey over the last seven years .
i started using a wheelchair 16 years ago when an extended illness changed the way i could access the world .
who do you implicitly feel connected to ?
like , i don &apos;t think this is going to work for me .
it may feel really small , but i promise you it makes a difference .
the man turned towards the kitchen and fired a single shot into yusor &apos;s hip , immobilizing her .
it is absolutely true .
we were making what was invisible visible .
and there &apos;s not even statistics on africa to know what is happening . &quot; &quot; i &apos;ll prove them wrong on both points .
but look , the rate of lowering in sweden was not fast .
and so , what &apos;s interesting about new power , is the way it feeds on itself .
and so , that experience tends to embolden you it tends to make you want more participation across more aspects of your life .
chris anderson : and now we go live to caracas to see one of maestro abreu &apos;s great proteges .
( music ) ( applause )
this crocodile , which grows to almost 20 feet long in the northern rivers , and this charismatic snake , the king cobra .
do you have those conversations with people ?
( applause ) thanks . ( applause )
i have a two-year-old daughter who &apos;s the best thing ever .
in africa last year , africans ate 600 million wild animals , and consumed two billion kilograms of bush meat .
20 years ago , there were three and a half million .
in maidan , the barricades have been dismantled , and the paving stones which were used as weapons during the protests replaced , so that traffic flows freely through the center of the square .
there were lines of bodies laid in the street .
( laughter ) and before we reach our final destination , ladies and gentlemen , i would like to share with you some technology that i brought all the way from the thriving metropolis of brisbane .
( laughter ) and the other ones here , i can use them in unison to mimic the effect of a drum machine or something like that .
i &apos;d like to put this kind of friday night bar discussion aside and get you to actually step into the lab .
okay , i &apos;ll help you . fourth one .
and i imagined a doctor coming to me and saying , &quot; &quot; your son has terminal brain cancer , and there &apos;s nothing you can do .
when connecticut adopted this system , in the very first year , 78 percent of elected representatives gave up large contributions and took small contributions only .
but notice immediately the distinctly different curve that we achieve with the blue line .
i &apos;d like to now switch to talk about another key shortcoming of today &apos;s vaccines , and that is the need to maintain the cold chain .
this is a very good year .
seti doesn &apos;t presume the existence of extra terrestrial intelligence ; it merely notes the possibility , if not the probability in this vast universe , which seems fairly uniform .
so rather than handcrafting knowledge representations and features , we create algorithms that learn , often from raw perceptual data .
but it doesn &apos;t happen automatically .
but in ancient times before tooth brushing , up to 600 milligrams might have built up on the teeth over a lifetime .
mummies are a great source of information , except that they &apos;re really geographically limited and limited in time as well .
he has been orphaned , as both of his parents died of aids , and his grandmother took care of him until he too died of aids .
kirsten ashburn : mmm , gosh .
( applause ) now this attraction to objects doesn &apos;t just work for celebrity objects .
bring me a canvas and some paint , and i will paint a vermeer much better than i sold that disgusting nazi .
we know that that works .
cystic fibrosis is an example of a disease where you just have a bad ingredient and you have a disease , and we can actually make a direct correspondence between the ingredient and the disease .
so this is not the type of choreography where i already have in mind what i &apos;m going to make , where i &apos;ve fixed the routine in my head and i &apos;m just going to teach it to them , and these so-called empty vessels are just going to learn it .
and that was the very first time that i found an opportunity to feel that i was able to express my own voice , and that &apos;s what &apos;s fueled me , then , to become a choreographer .
so what &apos;s africa looking like today ?
life expectancy has increased by one year every three years for the last decade .
thank you .
clearly , it &apos;s not as crazy as we were taught .
i was introduced to robyn , the swedish pop star , and she was also exploring how technology coexists with raw human emotion .
these were the low-tech approaches to the high-tech conversations i was having .
i get a sense of anticipation &quot; &quot; ?
it informs , it tells us , it supplies us answers before we &apos;ve even thought about it .
a bad sort of branding thing , or whatever .
so , same way , you know , i was good at art and good at math , and my father says , he &apos;s — john &apos;s good at math .
so , most animals make blue light , and most animals can only see blue light , but this fish is a really fascinating exception because it has two red light organs .
i do wish , with their budget , that they might have spent just a tiny bit more money to pay a consulting fee to some poor , starving graduate student , who could have told them that those are the eyes of a fish that &apos;s been preserved in formalin .
so i took it home and i watched .
and i noticed that when it was fed up with one petri dish , it would escape and find a better home .
we &apos;re looking for people that said , &quot; &quot; yes , race was a factor ; moreover it was an important factor , in my decision , &quot; &quot; and people who voted for john mccain as a result of that factor , maybe in combination with other factors , and maybe alone .
and we think people like this probably don &apos;t want to vote for people who look like this and are named barack obama .
but of course , the problems begin with those little nanoscale molecules , the machines that make the cells and the organs in our body tick .
it turns out that throughout biomedicine , there are other problems that expansion might help with .
i think all schools could use extra equipment , extra cash — it &apos;s going to be an incentive for them to do that .
so worldchanging.com , and building that blog , and it is a blog , and i &apos;m hoping that it isn &apos;t — i don &apos;t see it as the kind of blog where we &apos;re all going to follow each other to death .
and also , crucially , these systems don &apos;t operate under a single-answer logic .
so this is our problem .
and so how do you get a company to cede control of their main asset back to the users ?
and sometimes that involves inferring things about them , but if users don &apos;t want me to use that data , i think they should have the right to do that .
what i thought would be the ultimate limitation actually turned out to be the ultimate liberation , as each time i created , the destruction brought me back to a neutral place where i felt refreshed and ready to start the next project .
thank you .
my measure of this as being an important bit of design is not so much the way that it looks , but the fact that it performs a very important social function .
sometimes a trash can — this is just in the street in san francisco — a trash can that &apos;s been left there for 18 months creates a nice 45-degree angle against these other relationships , and turns a common parking spot into a nice little piece of sculpture .
we never do .
now i &apos;m an economist , i &apos;m not a doctor , but i see the god complex around me all the time in my fellow economists .
now , the question is , &quot; &quot; when will the catch up take place ? &quot; &quot; look at , look at the united states .
1858 was a year of great technological advancement in the west .
i won &apos;t elaborate .
money is not capital in most of the developing countries .
this is one page of work from a chemist ’ s workbook , ok ?
so what you ’ re smelling is several hundred molecules floating through the air , hitting your nose .
tell me . say it . is the child his ? is it his ?
knowledge becomes a weight upon wisdom .
i think that this is a strange moment .
so you see , the range is really quite diverse .
and it &apos;s the only market segment that &apos;s growing .
so this goes on in the formal economy as well as the informal economy , so it &apos;s wrong of us to blame — and i &apos;m not singling out siemens , i &apos;m saying everyone does it . okay ?
this is true . and yet here we are , my church in oxford , semi-detached from events that happened a long way away , but with our faith bruised .
now the unchanging god feels a bit cold and indifferent to me .
so this is really important because this is an insight that was not contained within any one wikipedia page .
i &apos;m just showing the new york times website here .
the international cat video film festival didn &apos;t have that much of a reaction . ( laughter ) i think this was truly fantastic .
last week , guardian art critic blah blah suggested that games cannot qualify as art . but is he right ?
but then he got older , he got calmer , and one day he was driving down the freeway in los angeles , and this is when it all changed for him .
not the work , the work was still oftentimes as dark as ever .
oh , because it includes pornography also ?
yeah , but , like , i see myself going forward as more likely , like , protecting sex workers &apos; , like , legal freedoms and rights .
and this beauty is the foundation of the tourism industry in many countries with few or little other natural resources .
so four years ago , we started following these at night and watching to see if we could figure out when they spawn in curaçao .
but the ants do , and we &apos;ll figure out why , so that ultimately we &apos;ll make this move . and imagine : you &apos;re going to be able to have swarms of these six-millimeter robots available to run around .
they all produce the pattern of a pogo stick . how is that true ?
and it has to be bi-directional .
we have a need to learn as well as to teach .
so the wiggly lines at the top , all the colors , this is the normal sort of data you would see on a monitor — heart rate , pulse , oxygen within the blood , and respiration .
let &apos;s pick a bit of data from another three-month-old patient .
but put a number in your head .
and the question of pay keeps coming up .
and when the natural breeze isn &apos;t enough , the kids deploy bubbles , but not the kind of bubbles you know .
then she took me to see a film that i really didn &apos;t want to see .
what we seem to be asking over and over is can we build a human-like computer ?
so i &apos;m sure a lot of you have been hearing a lot about artificial intelligence recently .
but all is not lost in translation .
i &apos;d set aside three weeks for this project , and that , i think , is what is meant by &quot; &quot; hubris &quot; &quot; — ( laughter ) — because it turned out to be three months .
we kind of see ourselves separate , but we &apos;re very much a part of it .
he was the kind of kid who parents would have to wonder , &quot; what is this 16-year-old boy doing with these 12-year-old boys ? &quot;
you would have three groups of four , and you would count it , a-one-two-three-four , one-two-three-four , one-two-three-four . together .
three is a groovin &apos; number .
so i tried to make my eyes bigger with my fingers .
but it doesn &apos;t work , my eyes are still small .
i think i was afraid that we would become inadvertent icons for the process of falling in love , a position i did not at all feel qualified for .
so here are a couple of sample questions .
and remember the gordian worm that i showed you , the cricket thing ?
when the cricket nears a body of water , such as this swimming pool , it jumps in and drowns , and the worm wriggles out of its suicidal corpse .
i &apos;m going to try to swim across the golden gate .
and next , what &apos;s our framework or our hierarchy for making decisions ?
out !
there &apos;s also one other aspect about these camels .
you &apos;re not robocop , and you &apos;re not terminator , but you &apos;re cyborgs every time you look at a computer screen or use one of your cell phone devices .
whether you like it or not , you &apos;re starting to show up online , and people are interacting with your second self when you &apos;re not there .
so you put that up front so that , if it fails , at least you know you don &apos;t have to reset the whole thing .
so it &apos;s important to remember that whether it &apos;s good or it &apos;s bad , &quot; this too shall pass . &quot;
and i &apos;m not unique , right ?
( laughter ) but the point i &apos;m trying to make , though , is that it &apos;s not enough for us to criticize .
he went through this old-growth forest and sat up beside this 400-year-old culturally modified tree and went to sleep .
so really what the ice does is it acts like a garden .
ss : an entire family at our research centre .
because we believe that it &apos;s not biology ; it &apos;s culture .
but our current funeral practices make the situation much worse .
but i learned it &apos;s nearly impossible to create a new hybrid mushroom .
how do you do this ? how do you solve this problem ?
( applause ) now , these aren &apos;t the only pair in the world .
80 to 90 percent of their time was spent on five things .
and we make pencils the length of which measures the grime that we &apos;ve pulled out of the air .
i took a speaker , i placed a thin foil of plastic on top of that speaker , and then i added tiny little crystals on top of that speaker .
what was so funny about it was that the speaker was only coming from the right side , so the right side of my face was completely red and i looked like the phantom of the opera for the rest of the week .
and indeed , future evolution will happen much faster , on a technological timescale , not a natural selection timescale .
it seems it &apos;s worthwhile just for a few people to think about these potential disasters .
( laughter ) but when you think of the world in that way , it does make going to starbucks a whole new experience , don &apos;t you think ?
what does it have ? it has fish , that &apos;s all .
i &apos;m disappointed that we never got to know each other as adults .
and i always tell people that i don &apos;t want to show up looking like a scientist .
the meme went out there .
we could talk about government data , enterprise data is really important , there &apos;s scientific data , there &apos;s personal data , there &apos;s weather data , there &apos;s data about events , there &apos;s data about talks , and there &apos;s news and there &apos;s all kinds of stuff .
so we were looking at how we could make a power station , that , instead of keeping people out and having a big fence around the outside , could be a place that pulls you in .
and so we were commissioned to design a bridge that would open .
i noticed that around christmastime , there have been peaks of demobilization since this war has started . &quot; &quot; and that was incredible , because that led us to think that we needed to talk to the human being and not to the soldier .
but we have a few problems .
that mineral has killed a lot : five millions of congolese have gone because of this colombo-tantalite — they call it coltan — that they use it to make cell phones and it has been in that area , all over in congo . extraction , and good , big business of the war .
he &apos;s not collecting plants , he &apos;s going to save our equipment on the canopy .
as i witnessed my father &apos;s body being swallowed by fire , i sat by his funeral pyre and wrote .
so art buchwald left his legacy of humor with a video that appeared soon after he died , saying , &quot; hi ! i &apos;m art buchwald , and i just died . &quot;
increasing ?
ok , let &apos;s go .
this bacterium has the special property that it makes light , so it makes bioluminescence , like fireflies make light .
the way that this symbiosis works is that this little squid lives just off the coast of hawaii , just in sort of shallow knee-deep water .
and tennis is global .
and that moment , i promised myself i &apos;d fight for equal rights and opportunities for boys and girls , men and women , the rest of my life .
now , &quot; &quot; the 99 &quot; &quot; is not just a comic book .
and by this time next year , the likes of superman and wonder woman will have joined forces with &quot; &quot; the 99 &quot; &quot; to beat injustice wherever they find it .
( music ) ( laughter ) nm : uh , sure .
( tuning ) nm : i feel like i &apos;m in the duck or the bird pose right now . ( laughter ) ( music ) ( audience claps along ) ( applause ) announcer : great news , they &apos;re running late downstairs .
you see the keyboard strapped to my wrist .
and it &apos;s , of course , for your kids .
and then it opened , and i have to tell you , it was incredible .
in this photo , everything looks very finished , but that granite edge , those lights , the back on that bench , the trees in planting , and the many different kinds of places to sit were all little battles that turned this project into a place that people wanted to be .
i always loved political cartoons , so why don &apos;t i do something with the content of my cartoons to make people think about the stupid rules that we &apos;re following as well as laugh ? &quot; &quot; now my perspective is a particularly — ( laughter ) — my perspective is a particularly american perspective .
( laughter ) i was afraid of womanhood .
so when we &apos;re talking about cutting government spending , this is the pie we &apos;re talking about , and americans overwhelmingly , and it doesn &apos;t matter what party they &apos;re in , overwhelmingly like that big 55 percent chunk .
wealth piles up in the wrong places .
if people can find that that sub-prime product has been transferred across nations many , many times until it ends up in banks in iceland or the rest in britain , and people &apos;s ordinary savings are affected by it , then you cannot rely on a system of national supervision .
i met her in a field , she was ragged , she had no shoes .
as my family and i ran for safety when i was about 12 from one of those attacks , i resolved that i would do everything i could to ensure that my own children would not go through the same experiences we had .
the prosthetic socket is the part in which the amputee inserts their residual limb , and which connects to the prosthetic ankle .
the example that he gives is the smallpox epidemic .
and every single time i failed , i had to start over .
so let &apos;s have a look at your home .
we could talk about a kind of soul , of a ghost accompanying them .
oh well , different story .
( laughter ) is that a good way to play ping-pong ?
and so they grabbed some very simple materials , you can see , and did this role-play , this kind of very crude role-play , just to get a sense of what it would be like for passengers if they were stuck in quite small places on airplanes .
and of course , they used experimentation in all aspects of their work , from films to buildings , from games to graphics .
and i needed to print another 1,500 more hours to complete printing my collection .
audience : cool !
and i think what is common to all astrolabes is that they are beautiful works of art .
right . so , that &apos;s how the device is used .
or can you move beyond my veil and see me for who i truly am inside ?
why should we do this as indians and pakistanis ?
every day , people come up to me and say , &quot; &quot; i wish i had interviewed my father or my grandmother or my brother , but i waited too long . &quot; &quot; now , no one has to wait anymore .
i &apos;ll have the opportunity to see you graduate .
it &apos;s totally rad . &quot; &quot; and my mother turned to me and said , &quot; what language is he speaking ? &quot;
my parents met in oxford in the &apos; 50s , and my mother moved to nigeria and lived there .
&quot; buddhist , &quot; of course , looks very , very similar to &quot; atheist . &quot;
and so , this year , chris sent us a ted conference simulator .
that led us to wonder , is there a strategy that we could use and teach people that would help change their perceptions of the distance , help them make exercise look easier ?
of course , there is no simple answer , but one reason , i argue , is that our mind &apos;s eye might work against us .
which presentation have you applauded the most this morning ?
i thought , age 21 , that we italians were good people and we were doing good work in africa .
and several of you have written to me with questions to ask our guest here from the nsa .
i mean , in that circumstance , couldn &apos;t you argue that what he did was reasonable ?
containerization has made it very efficient .
and yet , for such an enormous industry — there are a 100,000 working vessels on the sea — it &apos;s become pretty much invisible .
my best friend had already been killed .
william was the kind of kid that had been given every label .
because in agriculture , if you had 10 kids and you grow up a little bit earlier and you work a little bit harder , you could produce about five times more wealth , on average , than your neighbor .
we &apos;re just beginning this journey of life in the new zoo .
( applause )
not everyone . there were actually a few brave egyptians that i have to thank for being so brave — going into protests as a couple of hundred , getting beaten up and arrested .
ken robinson : good morning . how are you ?
ks : i have a crossfader .
this is some work from ray gun .
so , this is a project for nine inch nails .
here &apos;s an early computer .
and that leads to the suggestion , maybe economic growth is almost over .
and then you can see the inside of the heart .
maybe those reasons , or depending on where you are , cadavers may not be easily available .
in 1974 , i was young , i was naive , and i was pretty lost in my world .
about 900 people died that day , most of them taking their own lives .
manhattan in the show is not bound by gravity either .
the village square was filled with hundreds of people .
both models improve .
and i believe that . i believe that .
and think about what they might be telling you .
it was invited , after the first year , by the ars electronica museum in austria , to have it installed in their lobby .
while to most of us , living amongst these piles and piles of garbage may seem totally uninhabitable , to those in the zabbaleen , this is just a different type of normal .
the building was under construction until the collapse of the venezuelan economy and the death of the developer in the early &apos; 90s .
however , although it &apos;s very , very sad this news , it &apos;s also thanks to their personal stories that we have raised awareness of how lethal this disease can be .
but you can barely see it until i remove all the other organs in front .
thank you .
africa was being used as a success story !
we also don &apos;t know what they feel about recognition and identity .
they don &apos;t feel different .
please don &apos;t tell me i &apos;m normal .
thank you . ( applause ) ( applause )
so if you don &apos;t have an endgame of something delightful , then you &apos;re just moving chess pieces around , if you don &apos;t know you &apos;re taking the king .
and i was at the white house for president bush , meeting with every federal department and agency , and i pointed out that they appear to have no plan .
it &apos;s up to us women , because we are women , because we love our children .
for all the women , all the mothers that give life , you can give back , you can change .
the truth is , the end to this problem begins with us .
but really , what do you do , right ?
these just become numbers that we refer to .
there is a side that fights , and there is a side that keeps the schools and the factories and the hospitals open .
when is it suddenly not okay to love the way that we look ?
and we don &apos;t grow out of it .
tl : we really — thank you .
oh , my goodness . he &apos;s just too good .
how might we improve access to safe drinking water for the world &apos;s poorest people , and at the same time stimulate innovation amongst local water providers ?
we hosted a competition and then funded five of those organizations to develop their ideas .
i could feel the wind against my face and the beat of my racing heart as if it were happening in that very moment .
and how was i going to snowboard again ?
look at land , land and particularly forests .
it &apos;s an opportunity which we can use or it &apos;s an opportunity which we can lose .
they believe that things can be done .
the message , the final message , is this : india gave a great gift to the world .
now , what has bonded our team over the years is the idea of democratizing access to satellite information .
we want to enable the developer community to run their apps on our data .
so let &apos;s explore , through a couple of examples , the impact that technologies built to drive human-computer symbiosis have had in recent time .
this is an astonishing result : average men , average machines beating the best man , the best machine .
they invoked women &apos;s rights and misused images of mandela , tiananmen square , and even hitler .
we need to make illegal drugs legal .
a 1930s ship &apos;s lifeboat , which i &apos;ve been restoring in the garden of my beach house in england .
and it appears that , some night in 1947 she left her physical space and was missing all night , until she reappeared in the morning .
i rested for a day at home .
if you &apos;re crossing the street , you have sidewalk cutouts .
such is the power of self-study .
and because these materials are widely available and open-source , different people take them to very different and unpredictable directions .
there was a time in my life when everything seemed perfect .
and in closing , i want to share the personal reason why this meant so much to me and changed the direction of my life .
im : yeah , it is , exactly .
so that &apos;s what i do . i study color a lot .
and i &apos;m here to say that i think that that is the wrong summit of the pyramid ...
but i &apos;m here to say , as a professor of mathematics , that very few people actually use calculus in a conscious , meaningful way , in their day-to-day lives .
have you ever subsequently texted that person the phrase &quot; &quot; i &apos;m staring at the phone smiling like an idiot &quot; &quot; ?
have you ever seemed to lose your airplane ticket a thousand times as you walked from the check-in to the gate ?
demographics is really going to change our world .
they go to factories around the country .
certain subjects came up over and over : how much money they made , what kind of husband they hoped to marry , whether they should jump to another factory or stay where they were .
it &apos;s just hard to see when you &apos;re suddenly sucked into the city . it looks like everyone &apos;s poor and desperate , but that &apos;s not really how it is .
can you see your zodiac sign there ?
over thousands of years , this popular culture has affected people &apos;s major decisions , such as naming , marriage , giving birth and attitude towards each other .
and there are zero cures for these diseases .
and that &apos;s a shame because one out of five of us , that &apos;s 20 percent of the entire world , will have a neurological disorder .
and that &apos;s not just about me , that &apos;s about so many other michiganders , u.s. citizens , who don &apos;t understand why what they are is so much more significant than who they are .
( laughter ) because i , too , am in love , and apparently that &apos;s part of the gay lifestyle that i warned you about .
i climbed out of the ice .
but was it worth it ? yes , absolutely it was .
religion is more than belief .
why is that the assumption ?
and tokyo ? it &apos;s 46 .
right here in brazil , the life expectancy is 73.6 years .
as douglass north saw it , institutions are a tool to lower uncertainty so that we can connect and exchange all kinds of value in society .
this is true not just for electronics like smartphones , but for many kinds of goods and data , things like medicine , luxury goods , any kind of data or product that we don &apos;t want tampered with .
of course , from their grandparents and even their great-grandparents .
because they didn &apos;t start until 1964 with toefl , the american test of english .
you will find iron man and thor .
it &apos;s all the constituent social relations that make us up as a people .
i can see his hands reaching out , and i can see his face in terror , looking at me , saying , &quot; &quot; help me , dad . &quot; &quot; i got him . the wave broke over us .
and finally , often fitted with high-tech prosthesis , they exit the medical system and attempt to regain their pre-war lives .
( applause ) so it &apos;s really incredible for me to be a part of this .
and so , we wanted to find out might we be able to use hydrogen sulfide in the presence of cold , and we wanted to see whether we could reproduce this skier in a mammal .
folks like ann cotton , who started a group called camfed in africa , because she felt girls &apos; education was lagging .
and i asked him what he felt was the best thing i could do , or anyone could do , to make a difference in the long-term issues facing humanity .
a seat works in a two-dimensional world , where gravity blasts down on that seat , ok ?
but this lady here taught me , hah , taught me so much .
i see a lot of very blank faces .
we live in an incredibly busy world .
and the nurse thought about it and said very matter-of-factly , &quot; &quot; yeah , i think she &apos;ll do okay . &quot; &quot; i can remember that like it was yesterday .
sleep deprivation is absolutely pervasive .
( laughter ) the house of uncle bakheet and aunty fareeda was this kind of meeting point .
i make sure those messages are relevant to the place where i am painting but have this universal dimension , so anybody around the world can relate to it .
at the beginning , it was a disaster .
and so this kid was probably abused , abandoned , ignored , betrayed by almost every adult along the way .
career , we think about ; relationships , self — not so much .
thank you .
and so we redesigned chemistry , we redesigned physics .
and it has been for 50 years an experiment .
we had lost seven tons of oxygen .
and over time , essentially what have i been doing ?
and he was thinking , &quot; &quot; i &apos;m not dead . &quot; &quot; and he sat up .
no one could deal with it , and a minute later , kyle steiner sat back up from the dead , as it were , because he &apos;d come back to consciousness .
and i think we have lost our connection , and this is a wonderful way of reconnecting to our environment .
now , that &apos;s an awful lot of bees .
and the same is starting to happen with hardware too .
then pretty soon , i was broke too .
