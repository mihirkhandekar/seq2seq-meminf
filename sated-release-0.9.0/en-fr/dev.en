this is my multitasking activity result . ( laughter ) so trying to cook , answering the phone , writing sms , and maybe uploading some pictures about this awesome barbecue .
let &apos;s consider for a while the option of monotasking .
we &apos;ve heard about your work with the kids and the ex-steel workers , and we &apos;re inclined to want to support your desire to build a new building .
do the math — it will never work .
we realized that we had to become a better mirror for mario .
now , the theory of mirror neurons simply says that in your brains , exactly now , as you watch me doing this , you are activating exactly the same neurons as if you do the actions .
i was basically intruding in his living space .
walking in this tunnel is very peaceful .
let &apos;s look at one example here .
we &apos;ve been working together since , well , since we were kids , really .
you become sick of thinking .
can we make a hat into a toy ?
and two weeks after this drawing was done , we actually had our first project contract , at aerovironment , on robotic cockroaches , which was very frightening to me .
( applause ) tm : all right . you all got a couple of these in your gift bags , and one of the first things , the production version seemed to dive a little bit , and so i would just suggest you bend the wing tips up a little bit before you try flying it .
now , psychoanalysts know very well that people surprisingly don &apos;t have passion for knowledge but passion for ignorance .
&quot; sperm donor ? what &apos;s the rush ? &quot;
from conflict zones to climate change to all sorts of issues around crises in public health , we were missing what i call the species-level issues , because as a species , they could actually sink us .
( applause )
people will say to you , &quot; you look great . have you had any work done ? &quot;
your life will have new meaning .
as an investment you make to sort and classify people so that employers can hire them more easily .
( applause )
many buildings , public buildings , around the country — this is new york city — had these little civil defense signs , and the idea was that you would run into one of these shelters and be safe from the nuclear weaponry .
now you might want to look at plutonium as another fissionable material that you might use in a bomb .
if this were battlestar galactica and you &apos;re fighting the cylons , don &apos;t hide behind the black hole .
it &apos;s sort of like ding , ding , ding .
dr. bostrom has a number of followers .
if i want to create an artificially intelligent legal assistant , i will teach it some corpus of law but at the same time i am fusing with it the sense of mercy and justice that is part of that law .
my grandpa owned and operated a sheet metal kitchen cabinet factory in brooklyn .
we need to encourage them to work hard and help them understand that failure is a necessary ingredient for success , as is perseverance .
but as they work together , something starts to change , and finally in &quot; &quot; the adventure of the six napoleons , &quot; &quot; once holmes comes in , dazzles everybody with his solution , lestrade turns to holmes and he says , &quot; &quot; we &apos;re not jealous of you , mr. holmes .
when we feel jealous , we tell ourselves a story .
it &apos;s because young men get upset .
well , the conventional approach to post-conflict situations has rested on , on kind of , three principles .
( applause ) pm : and we should point out that he works with you as well at the paper .
and you cannot do parachute reporting — just jump into a country for two days and think that you &apos;ve done your homework and a story .
two ? so you should have sat down earlier .
and as the dawn came up and he went to meet his destiny , he left this pile of papers on the table for the next generation .
so , we began through our nonprofit institute &apos;s training hospitals around the country , and we found that most people could avoid surgery , and not only was it medically effective , it was also cost effective .
and so he went up on the board and he wrote the word &quot; &quot; illness , &quot; &quot; and circled the first letter , and then wrote the word &quot; &quot; wellness , &quot; &quot; and circled the first two letters ...
millions of refugees are living in exile , in limbo .
amazingly , little masa survived .
what we want to do is spin that around .
now we could approach this from a working memory perspective or from a multitasking perspective .
it was a little over 100 years ago that beijerinck discovered viruses .
but is that really the case ?
instead of wheels , a ballbot is balancing and moving on one single ball .
let me introduce to you rezero .
judge forer did what she was required to do , and then she quit the bench .
and michael disappeared .
he was there alone drinking and she was with friends .
she said yes , and that was it .
now , when you go back home , if you see a barren piece of land , do remember that it can be a potential forest .
today , we are working on an internet-based platform where we are going to share our methodology on an open source using which anyone and everyone can make their own forest without our physical presence being there , using our methodology .
( applause )
because in the end , it comes down to a combination of trust and leadership .
that means that you guys will soon be able to access one of these machines , if not this minute .
you can direct what color that product will be , perhaps what material .
it seems like when you give people easier ways to share information , more good things happen .
probably the most important third-party development came from a little company in virginia called summize .
man wishes to be happy , only wishes to be happy , and cannot wish not to be so .
it &apos;s sort of &quot; &quot; me , &quot; &quot; not &quot; &quot; we . &quot; &quot; and i think this has been a really tremendous problem that goes against our biology and nature , and hasn &apos;t made us any happier at all .
as a scientist and engineer , i &apos;ve focused on efficiency for many years .
shared memories — that &apos;s where the old bbc building was ; and personal memories — that &apos;s where i gave my first kiss .
this was more than 10 years ago , but ever since , my laboratory has followed the pragmatic approach to recovery after spinal cord injury .
immediately , the paralyzed rat can stand .
and as a golfer and as a kid , one of the things that really sort of seeped into my pores , that i sort of lived my whole life , is process .
what you &apos;re going to learn is this .
changing into a totally different field , we do a lot of stuff in solid state physics , particularly in an area called metamaterials .
but if you get to play with all those knobs and dials — and of course , really the controller over there does it all on software — you can make some terrific ribs .
i don &apos;t know what it is . i get asked in interviews a lot , &quot; my god , you &apos;re guitars are so gigantic ! &quot;
so we don &apos;t really have a place in the universe , as far as on a time line .
( audio ) al gore : i consider myself among the majority who look at windmills and feel they &apos;re a beautiful addition to the landscape .
so that &apos;s push pop press &apos; first title , al gore &apos;s &quot; &quot; our choice . &quot; &quot; thank you .
in fact , this is the forecast picture .
now how did we get here ?
there were no clouds in the sky .
they can grow so big , blocking all daylight , making it very dark and ominous standing under them .
most of the pills that you can take or the yogurts that you can eat have one or two species in them , maybe five species in them , and the human community is thousands upon thousands of species .
so you have caught flesh-eating disease if you caught that one .
so we &apos;re seeing there &apos;s a real extension of middle age .
but my most important question was always the same .
and because we can , we must .
the war against terror , yes .
and so we can control that with micro-controllers and create a fully volumetric , three-dimensional display with just 256 leds .
i &apos;ve got a little video to show you , but keep in mind that this is with no electronic control , and this is also with only four leds .
and i thought about so much about the soldiers who i eventually had to end up leading .
and i kept on getting lost .
i know that they were tougher for a lot of people , not just me .
( laughter ) and slowly over time , i started putting myself in a better mood .
so what you see now is called &quot; &quot; shadow foreshadow . &quot; &quot; and what i &apos;d like to tell you is we don &apos;t see shadow , and we don &apos;t see light too ; we see the source of the light .
i think you should study in a school of art .
also , even if we were born with certain ignoble motives , they don &apos;t automatically lead to ignoble behavior .
there is no society ever discovered in the remotest corner of the world that has not had something that we would consider the arts .
i was trained to be prepared in a medical emergency .
you know , we have this saying in medicine : children are not just little adults .
( laughter ) em : i got that question a lot , that &apos;s true .
em : i &apos;m extremely confident that solar will be at least a plurality of power , and most likely a majority , and i predict it will be a plurality in less than 20 years .
thank you . ( applause )
and while remixing and sharing have come to define the web as we know it , all of us can now be part of that story through simple tools that allow us to make things online .
it &apos;s : this is what i have done because i &apos;m excited by it , because it &apos;s a wonderful thing , and it &apos;s done something for me and , of course , it &apos;s accomplished a great deal .
and i think that it &apos;s going to be , in time , the elements of the human spirit that we &apos;ve been hearing about bit by bit by bit from so many of the speakers in the last few days .
we have international treaties that recognize that refugees are a shared responsibility , and yet we accept that tiny lebanon hosts more syrians than the whole of europe combined .
brazil has adopted a pioneering approach where over 2,000 syrians have been able to get humanitarian visas , enter brazil , and claim refugee status on arrival in brazil .
because sounds from the outside world have to travel through the mother &apos;s abdominal tissue and through the amniotic fluid that surrounds the fetus , the voices fetuses hear , starting around the fourth month of gestation , are muted and muffled .
this is what happened to the children of the dutch &quot; &quot; hunger winter . &quot; &quot; and their higher rates of obesity , diabetes and heart disease are the result .
politics and politicians will only succeed if they actually try and treat with people as they are , rather than as they would like them to be .
and hopefully this slide is going to morph beautifully . there we are .
one that has just happened in the last few months is the successful approval of a drug for cystic fibrosis .
and instead of telling you more about it , i &apos;m going to invite one of them , sam berns from boston , who &apos;s here this morning , to come up on the stage and tell us about his experience as a child affected with progeria .
but it &apos;s also law . and of course cities are ways to make things more useful to us .
so , we &apos;ve invented ourselves . of all the animals that we have domesticated , the most important animal that we &apos;ve domesticated has been us . okay ?
everest is an extreme environment .
what looks like a cloud behind the summit ridge is actually snow being blown off the summit .
we &apos;re certainly going to be looking at more .
we &apos;ve put all of that together into one thing , and i &apos;ll show you what that synthesis looks like .
let &apos;s start with the butlers . here &apos;s an example of one : &quot; on my way . &quot; anybody ever written , &quot; on my way ? &quot;
and what we found was very , very interesting .
he told me that his graduate student kenong xu and himself were studying an ancient variety of rice that had an amazing property .
we must try to minimize environmental degradation .
so , all of these things — greater metabolic demands , reduced reproductive success , changes in respiration and metabolism .
we are , right now , at 390 parts per million of co2 in the atmosphere .
here &apos;s another argument against this view .
his name is the dalai lama .
my choice is the culmination of a lifetime commitment that began with growing up on the gulf coast of alabama , on the florida peninsula .
this vast domain of hidden biodiversity is increased still further by the dark matter of the biological world of bacteria , which within just the last several years still were known from only about 6,000 species of bacteria worldwide .
the weight of a paper clip is approximately equal to 900 zeta-illion — 10 to the 21st — molecules of isoprene .
( applause )
crossing miles and miles of sastrugi — frozen ice snowdrifts that could be hip-deep .
and do you get along ? i certainly hope so , because at some point or another on this expedition , one of your teammates is going to have to take a very big needle , and put it in an infected blister , and drain it for you .
we cannot only have grateful experiences .
we all know from experience how it goes .
without that mandate , they would be corrupt .
we all understand why we have elections , and we all leave the house on the same day to go and vote .
so what is between thinking and doing ?
a sort of a run track , or a walk track , on the top of a museum in denmark , which is made of colored glass , going all around .
it &apos;s not going to kill you .
might we answer that clarion call with science , with reason , with facts , and , dare i say it , emotions ?
it takes a human effort , a team effort , to bring the fish in .
they are some of our finest instruments , our new technology in the ocean today .
so , for example , although well over 100 books are translated from french and published in the uk each year , most of them will come from countries like france or switzerland .
but rafidah &apos;s kindness proved to be the pattern for that year .
and that , in fact , these connections were vast and that we were all embedded in this broad set of connections with each other .
on the far left , you see the purple line .
a race of advanced extraterrestrials watching our solar system from afar could confidently predict earth &apos;s final doom in another six billion years .
i don &apos;t go along with all that , but it &apos;s interesting that he had a simple solution .
show of hands , were you right ?
but attention is what steers your perceptions , it &apos;s what controls your reality .
or , as geoffrey moore once told me , it &apos;s intellectual curiosity that &apos;s the trade that brands need in the age of the blogosphere .
enter the atomic bomb .
i mean , this is one vision of it .
it &apos;s october of 1957 , and sputnik has just launched , and we &apos;re in laurel maryland , at the applied physics lab associated with johns hopkins university .
but at the time , that was the largest molecule of a defined structure that had been made .
the first is , &quot; &quot; to live , to err , to fall , to triumph and to recreate life out of life . &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a james joyce quote .
even when you &apos;re standing in front of a megaphone , it &apos;s pretty much every direction .
i &apos;m the happiest guy you &apos;re ever going to meet .
lab partner : who was that ?
lp : who &apos;s ted ?
and i &apos;m going to show them to you now , because they came out of very specific conditions .
bloomberg was all about numbers , and we did big numbers through the space and the numbers were projected on a spectacular led that my partner , lisa strausfeld , programmed .
and i guess that the question is , is it possible to break free from that mindset ?
so i was in new york recently , and i walked past a gym that had an advertisement in the window for a new course , a new evening course .
so we fought , we struggled , we triumphed .
we followed my job , and it seemed like there was nothing that we couldn &apos;t do .
you gotta love the aussies , right ?
about 80 percent of global ceos see sustainability as the root to growth in innovation and leading to competitive advantage in their industries .
and we &apos;re seeing people transform their lives .
and this is made with chickpeas , dried milk and a host of vitamins , matched to exactly what the brain needs .
they help maintain the stability and health of the oceans , and even provide services to human society .
whale carcasses are some of the largest form of detritus to fall from the ocean &apos;s surface , and they &apos;re called whale fall .
and yet simply by changing the frame of reference it reveals so much , including what ended up being the ted prize .
if we watch the next clip , you &apos;re going to see the first version of &quot; &quot; powers of ten , &quot; &quot; upper left .
so the argument i &apos;m making is , is that we &apos;re increasing the quality of our local workforce , and thereby increasing economic development .
in fact , this effect is so strong that when someone gets a college degree , the spillover effects of this on the wages of others in the metropolitan area are actually greater than the direct effects .
the three of us take this class together .
but that one word made a really big difference .
and it &apos;s plotted in this funny way by going up by factors of 10 , otherwise you couldn &apos;t get everything on the graph .
it &apos;s an integrated system that has evolved despite all the planning and so on .
( applause )
you still are on a piece of ice , you can still have sunlight and you can still survive while you &apos;re traveling from one place to another .
and i &apos;ve tried to put together something that &apos;s a good start for this .
sort of a timeline , very non-linear scale , nature rates and trilobites and dinosaurs , and eventually we saw some humans with caves ... birds were flying overhead , after pterosaurs .
i refuse to be drawn on the question of whether god exists , until somebody properly defines the terms .
and on the photograph , he wrote with a flourish , &quot; to horse face , with love from geoffrey dickens , m.p. &quot;
so , the bigger problem with this logic is that it confuses the intended versus the actual uses of technology .
so that &apos;s why i &apos;ve always been fascinated with how technology could actually reshape and open up authoritarian societies like ours .
even that though . another confession : once in a book on pre-war poland , a studio portrait , an absolute angel , an absolute angel with tormented , tormenting eyes .
i was sort of astonished to find out how many i have actually .
poor kids need that experience .
they operated 10 to 3 . they were closed for lunch hour .
the faa , about a year ago , gave us an exemption for the transition to allow us to have an additional 110 lbs .
and the result is the terrafugia transition .
that &apos;s just how i felt as i had those conversations with the students . i was amazed at the ideas that they had , and i wanted others to experience this wonderland as well .
and when presenting your work , drop the bullet points .
it was something i read in an editorial by a woman who was talking about the war in iraq . and she said , &quot; save a man from drowning , you are responsible to him for life . &quot;
years go by , of course , and the writing , it doesn &apos;t happen instantly , as i &apos;m trying to convey it to you here at ted .
what ? did we do this ? really ? does anyone do this ?
one is that the aliens might be very far away .
and you see there , it gets reintegrated in tissue .
so you think of alternative mechanical parts .
so we need marine vehicles .
it was so hot , on one of the robots , the tracks began to melt and come off .
you do not have to teach someone how to drive romo .
so meet romo .
it &apos;s dependent on hospitals and clinics for our every care need .
those bedsores become infected , and they give me an antibiotic which i end up being allergic to , and now my whole body breaks out , and now all of those become infected .
and by that , i mean that i develop robots that are characters , but also robots that will eventually come to empathize with you .
and this is one of the most exciting projects that we &apos;re developing , which is a little character that &apos;s a spokesbot for friendly artificial intelligence , friendly machine intelligence .
this was seen by robust and steady gdp growth , by low and controlled inflation , by low unemployment , and controlled and low financial volatility .
now , these are big claims .
rather , it was a form of political action in a context when the city budget i had available after being elected amounted to zero comma something .
barack obama won — ( applause ) — because he mobilized people as never before through the use of social networks .
but with this sort of power , it really depends on where you stand , because one man &apos;s hero can be another &apos;s villain , and so the syrian electronic army is a pro-assad group of hackers who support his contentious regime .
these are usually great arrangements for companies to reward hackers disclosing vulnerabilities they find in their code .
so once i had the opportunity to stay in a ritzy , five-star hotel .
i mean , i &apos;m wearing a tie , first . and then secondly , i &apos;m a little bit nervous because i &apos;m speaking in a foreign language , and i want to apologize in advance , for any mistakes i might make .
thank you very much .
it &apos;s called the meta 2 .
and i like to write bass lines , so they both ended up kind of as bass lines .
the musician or musicians are invited to walk onto the stage with a stopwatch and open the score , which was actually purchased by the museum of modern art — the score , that is .
but i want her to know that this world is made out of sugar .
and those are the very days you have all the more reason to say thank you .
i &apos;ve been working on my new record and i &apos;ve never played these songs for anybody except the microphone .
that &apos;s the first time i &apos;ve ever played it .
you can do a lot of things .
now , it could happen , but i &apos;m not going to plan my life around it .
you may not know this , but you are celebrating an anniversary with me .
thankfully , i met reda girgis , who is dry as toast , but he and his team at johns hopkins didn &apos;t just want me to survive , they wanted me to live a meaningful life .
let &apos;s look at some of the maps being created by users right now .
this is the result of computational geometry , gesture recognition , and machine learning .
this is a geep , a goat-sheep hybrid .
so now we have a complete living lamprey eel brain .
coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind , and petroleum is cheaper than biofuels .
what happened ?
in the summer of 2009 , my dad was diagnosed with lung cancer .
but when we were done , what we found was something that was sort of surprising .
we sign with a major label .
it &apos;s about a few people loving you up close and about those people being enough .
bf : all right ? oh my gosh . oh .
dh : whoa , sorry . all right .
does anyone here know the company multi-health systems ?
and amazon , on the other hand , they did it the wrong way around .
i built an interactive chemistry exhibit at the museum of science and industry in chicago , and this exhibit lets people use physical objects to grab chemical elements off of the periodic table and bring them together to cause chemical reactions to happen .
think about which you find easier to use , a physical keyboard or an onscreen keyboard like on a phone ?
except for the threat of bio-terrorism , they &apos;re very simple issues in terms of , can we design things to produce clean energy , perhaps revolutionizing what developing countries can do and provide through various simple processes .
this is a glass beaker after about half a million rads of radiation .
in 2002 we had about 50 percent of the people jobless there .
it &apos;s not good .
and we found , to our surprise , that we not only got bone marrow out , but we got 10 times the stem cell activity in the marrow from the marrow miner , compared to the normal device .
and the marrow miner , the way it works is shown here .
the dealer near your house sells this particular stereo for 200 dollars , but if you drive across town , you can get it for 100 bucks .
it &apos;s like the dictionary ; it &apos;s hard to look things up by the third letter .
i think self-discipline is something , it &apos;s like a muscle .
the other problem with commitment devices is that you can always weasel your way out of them .
i think collectively we can build a global community .
we can also use cymatics as a beautiful natural art form .
and it would be possible to have nationwide satellite radio , and that &apos;s sirius xm today .
i was a single male parent . she was a single female parent .
and the reason it does is not because of the clever encryption .
facebook has started a dark net site .
in generations .
( laughter ) i said , i know a coded message when i see one .
so what you &apos;re looking at here is a heat image of the system , and what you can see here emerging from the poo is a cool dung ball .
so this animal here has got a brain about the size of a grain of rice , and yet it can do things that you and i couldn &apos;t possibly entertain the idea of doing .
what they figured out was that there was not enough effort involved .
most people would say for a lot , a lot of money .
they all need a face .
what does it look like ?
and he said , &quot; &quot; i had a truck , before i went over there , and it had a stick .
you know , this country is involved as we &apos;ve all heard , in this great healthcare debate .
local communities on the east coast would get together and whole teams of 10 , 20 people would caravan across the united states , and they would form companies .
the next thing that really was a big , big deal was the washing machine .
and the point is really that we evolved to be satisfied by the world in particular ways .
and so these combine to form a very intense emotional engagement .
and we see this all the time .
and the friends &apos; names each have a connotation in japanese to a color .
well , i have to tell you , from the bottom of our hearts , thank you so very , very much .
he walks the face of the earth right now and knows why he &apos;s here .
in the history of the past 50 years , the smoking risk shows how a model changes , and it also shows how an industry fights against a model it doesn &apos;t like .
that &apos;s basically the difference .
it calls its first responders .
and besides that , there &apos;s the whole problem of getting the system into the cell in the first place .
secondly , i did a little research .
( video ) ron jeremy : i was born in flushing , queens on march , 12 , 1953 , at four o &apos;clock in the morning .
i had fun again , i worked harder and , to cut a long story short , did all the things that took me back up to success .
because with no employees , there was nobody for me to manage .
on his last job he was working with his boss , and they started pouring the columns wrong .
i was afraid of a tsunami ; what i didn &apos;t realize was there was a greater terror in haiti , and that was building collapse .
what would the world be like if we combined all our simple solutions ?
so as a child , my parents used to drag me to these family events .
when their kids were five and two , carol had a stroke and a brain tumor and died suddenly .
and the third insight is that we &apos;re not primarily self-contained individuals .
but it all revolved around that original definition of success .
there was a time when i made them wear jackets and shirts and ties .
( laughter ) so , as for the outsiders looking in , watch the cnn report on the second amman comedy festival .
( applause )
and her research also shows that it actually trains bad habits .
why should we value that as success ?
our goal is to create a global network of civic hackers who are innovating on the existing system in order to build tools that will solve entrenched problems , that will support local government , and that will empower citizens .
all of you are potential civic hackers .
so i do .
this is everyone &apos;s problem , and we all play a role in dismantling systems of inequality .
it &apos;s not hardware .
so what about the next step ?
kb : i live over there .
back in karachi , as an 18-year-old , i thought this was the biggest failure of my entire life .
it looks more global . if you take this whole thing , it is a very big machine , very reliable machine , more reliable than its parts .
and so in the same way , we &apos;re going to not imagine ourselves without this other machine being there .
there &apos;s a quote from moses on the side of the liberty bell , and it comes from a passage in the book of leviticus , that every seven years you should let the land lay fallow .
&quot; i believe my girls will have plenty of opportunities in their lives , &quot; i wrote these men .
but the desire element is really dialed way up .
and it &apos;s important to note that it &apos;s not just the stars who are benefiting : because you can see the best , everyone can learn .
and so at that time , of course , there was no refrigeration .
this particular shrimp , we &apos;ve dubbed it the jurassic shrimp , it &apos;s thought to have gone extinct 50 years ago — at least it was , until the census discovered it was living and doing just fine off the coast of australia .
my favorite is the middle one — the mp3 player , nose hair trimmer , and crème brûlée torch .
you want button fly or zipper fly ? you want stonewashed or acid-washed ?
so here he is walking through the grass .
and i love those revolutions , and i love the future that milo brings .
for that meal , every child drank one cup to survive .
we need more leaders .
i could picture them as real in my mind , and there i run it , test it and improve it .
( applause )
it &apos;s just wrong .
and i wondered , what if the answer to some of our biggest problems could be found in the smallest of places , where the difference between what is valuable and what is worthless is merely the addition or subtraction of a few atoms ?
in doing so , we &apos;ve destroyed our credibility with the security council , which means it &apos;s very difficult to get a resolution on syria , and we &apos;re setting ourselves up again for failure .
and even if they were able to do so , even if i &apos;m wrong , it &apos;s extremely unlikely the taliban would invite back al-qaeda .
but that &apos;s why i noticed grameen bank , which is a bank for poor people , and had 1,100 branches , 12,000 employees , 2.3 million borrowers .
but you know , they have , after all , evolved in a country without telephones , so they are decentralized . i mean , of course there might be other good reasons , but this was one of the reasons — they had to be .
and so what i want to do with you in , oh god , only 10 minutes , is to really think again this juxtaposition , because it actually has massive , massive implications beyond innovation policy , which just happens to be the area that i often talk with with policymakers .
so the internet , which you can surf the web anywhere you are in the world ; gps , where you can actually know where you are anywhere in the world ; the touchscreen display , which makes it also a really easy-to-use phone for anybody .
now , there are many ways you can get infected .
so this is writing out the malicious code , and a few seconds later , on the left-hand side , you &apos;ll see the attacker &apos;s screen get some interesting new text .
this is when the surge happens .
there was data within the streams of news that we consume .
supernova explosions are very extreme .
but then , i lost my sight .
we &apos;ve all seen pictures like this on television and in the news . this is an operations center .
of course , the terrorists knew that no indian schoolteacher stays at a suite in the taj .
they were trying to figure out how to rebuild their universities .
since education under the soviet union was essentially propaganda serving the purposes of a state ideology , they appreciated that it would take wholesale transformations if they were to provide an education worthy of free men and women .
most of our countries don &apos;t even have any opinion research .
external debt — something that i can tell you a long story about because i personally worked on one of the biggest debts on the continent — has come down dramatically .
she looked at me , and she said , &quot; &quot; you &apos;re exactly the person i need to talk to .
now i &apos;m here with a genuine expert .
&quot; yahweh is our savior &quot; means &quot; he has saved the nation of israel , &quot; which at the time , was a pretty high-level social organization .
thanks .
the second question is , what does the blogosphere actually do for us , in terms of accessing collective intelligence ?
a network is not just the product of its component parts .
ok now . arthur &#91; ganson &#93; hasn &apos;t talked yet , but his is going to be a delightful talk and he has some of his really fantastic machines outside . and so , we — scott created this wonderful tribute to arthur ganson .
ok . we can violate your expectations about shape .
thank you .
he sealed the transcripts and placed them under a protective order in an attempt to prevent someone like me from doing something like this .
we will be using the tv screens or their equivalents for electronic books of the future .
it was a zero-bandwidth teleconferencing system at the time .
rg : uh oh .
we have charted our love for our child over time .
( laughter ) and each butter-fry is composed of different pieces .
because i want to simplify them for you .
and i want to share with you my latest art project .
but you know , i have a problem with children &apos;s books : i think they &apos;re full of propaganda .
then these children increasingly in evaluation after evaluation , in their operations in language , and their operations in reading — we document that abnormal neurology .
now that you know , now that science is telling us that you are in charge , that it &apos;s under your control , that your happiness , your well-being , your abilities , your capacities , are capable of continuous modification , continuous improvement , and you &apos;re the responsible agent and party .
that means those students are getting half the learning they &apos;re supposed to , because if one child is disrupting the class no one can learn .
as we saw with the teacher in cody , wyoming , she seems to be affected by the law .
here &apos;s the reality .
liberation , however , costs some money .
and i just want you to think a little bit about , remember for yourself , it &apos;s annoying when you hit this thing .
the 404 page is that .
it has to be smart enough to avoid terrain hazards and to find a good landing site on the ice .
the real hat trick for this vehicle , though , is a disruptive new navigation system we &apos;ve developed , known as 3d slam , for simultaneous localization and mapping .
his brothers certainly were able to run long distances chasing prey , probably sweating heavily as they did so .
but as far as we know , we &apos;re the only upright-walking ape that exists on planet earth today , except for the bonobos .
is he going to say 10 ?
( laughter ) yeah ?
ultimately , we have to recognize that ideology is the enemy of growth .
first of all , we can draw on the right-wing policies to see what could be beneficial for us to think about how we can improve capitalism .
and if we jam nutrients , sewage , fertilizer in the base of that food pyramid , it can back up all through it .
that &apos;s another story .
let me give you an example from history .
it really should be called the recovery or return of asia .
so one of the first things we needed to do was figure out what a cause of action was , a legal cause of action .
it takes a long time to learn how to do that , and they excavated the area and they found that this material culture , this way of doing it , these rocks , had passed down for at least 4,300 years through 225 chimpanzee generations .
so it &apos;s a really slow process , it &apos;s really expensive , and the outcome of that process , namely electronic circuit boards , are limited in all sorts of kind of interesting ways .
( music ) ( laughter ) ( applause ) pretty cool , huh ? we think so .
but what i &apos;m interested in is the development of the modern mind , of the evolution of creativity , of imagination , of abstract thought , about what it means to be human .
and with its invention , it became possible for the first time for a message to be transmitted and preserved beyond a single moment in place and time .
the house is sort of a distortion of a square block .
you &apos;ll walk around , start looking for a bicycle on the roof , jump on your ride and then continue out into the rest of the expo .
so we &apos;re talking about the end of human drudgery .
the second assumption is that we will keep going .
now go back to the cretaceous period and look at our tiny , fuzzball ancestors .
only unlike the dinosaurs , we can see it coming .
now , what does this have to do with energy ?
now , i &apos;ll tell you another little , very important story about this picture .
and then they can track them , and at the end of the day , they look and see , did these guys get every single street , every single house .
his right leg was paralyzed in 2004 .
no . contrary to what &apos;s usually said , testability is common , in myths and all sorts of other irrational modes of thinking .
any crank claiming the sun will go out next tuesday has got a testable prediction .
now , we &apos;re still collecting data .
well , i &apos;m an experimental dermatologist , so what we did was we thought we &apos;d have to expose our experimental animals to sunlight .
telling this same story at a family dinner , my aunt tells me , &quot; but no , andrés , i &apos;ve been there . i &apos;ve swum in that river . &quot;
there &apos;s still more research to be done to better constrain the problem and better understand the system , but from what the data is telling us now , it looks to be the result of a large hydrothermal system .
and we think we &apos;ll have the first fourth-generation fuels in about 18 months .
this is over 580,000 letters of genetic code ; it &apos;s the largest molecule ever made by humans of a defined structure .
but play &apos;s a shapeshifter .
thank you .
16 percent ! meaning that there were these pinpoint tumors in skeletal muscle , but only .16 percent of actual metastases — suggesting that maybe skeletal muscle is able to control the angiogenesis , is able to control the tumors recruiting these blood vessels .
i mean , there are so many possibilities for why tumors don &apos;t go to skeletal muscle .
or , i can have you really pay attention by getting very quiet .
then we have timbre .
you can say , &quot; &quot; give a muffin to a mouse , &quot; &quot; the prepositional dative .
in the workplace , for example , there &apos;s often a tension over whether an employee can socialize with the boss , or refer to him or her on a first-name basis .
it was a complete turnaround from that night in 2008 when proposition 8 was passed .
sm : okay , why ? what &apos;s up ? man : i ain &apos;t with that .
they intentionally have a head-on collision with the wall so they don &apos;t slow down and can transition up it in 75 milliseconds .
to understand it better , we did a ct scan of the exoskeleton and showed that they can compress their body by over 40 percent .
now , there &apos;s a lot going on in this movie , so let me break this down and show you what &apos;s going on .
some other heroes can become invisible .
and the kind of synergies i &apos;m talking about are , firstly , both these technologies work very well in hot , sunny deserts .
thank you .
he just lay in the hospital bed , and , kind of , stared at the polystyrene ceiling tiles for a really long time .
very small example of something that they could do .
at the same time , older people have gained in value today precisely because of their unique experience of living conditions that have now become rare because of rapid change , but that could come back .
in my remaining four minutes today , i can offer just a few suggestions .
so you don &apos;t have to ask any of these guys .
so imagine he tells you to move the top truck left .
but today we have a thousand college student advocates who are working to connect nearly 9,000 patients and their families with the resources that they need to be healthy .
i believe that we all have a vision for healthcare in this country .
biofuels production is integrated with alternative energy is integrated with aquaculture .
well , that &apos;s less than one percent of the surface area of the bay .
so she campaigned for cleaner , lighter , airier clinics to be designed and built .
her mission was to provide decent healthcare for everyone .
online dictionaries right now are paper thrown up on a screen .
if only one out of every 10 of those books had a word that &apos;s not in the dictionary in it , that would be equivalent to more than two unabridged dictionaries .
therefore all of you , in the buddhist view , in some previous life , although you don &apos;t remember it and neither do i , have been my mother — for which i do apologize for the trouble i caused you .
and then , third , you step from there to what is called &quot; &quot; a feeling of gratitude . &quot; &quot; you want to repay that kindness that all beings have shown to you .
because of the speed and brevity of social media , we are forced to jump to conclusions and write sharp opinions in 140 characters about complex world affairs .
it was the most inspiring and empowering moment of my life .
again , you can get the playback and personal contribution .
you can see this is a major shipping airport , and there &apos;s all kinds of activity there .
and later , between 100 and 50,000 years ago or so , went out of africa to colonize the rest of the world .
and they are around three billion such letters long .
now , truth in advertising . right ?
and since the mass determines the schwarzschild radius , there is actually only one thing i really need to know .
it is a moment in time .
but in case you do , here it is : they &apos;re waiting , we &apos;re waiting for you to show us where to go next .
it &apos;s really become sacred to us .
she said she remembers her heart bursting out of her chest when she saw that place for the very first time nine years earlier .
they look like they &apos;re expensive , but that cost reflects the fact that you need to maintain the burial plot — like , someone has to cut the grass for the next 50 years .
and so that means that , technically , this applies to , like , the back garden of your house in the suburbs .
if the diagnostic criteria had to be broadened , why were they so narrow in the first place ?
so what &apos;s going on ?
stress gives us access to our hearts .
how about a moderate amount of stress ?
all right , from skate physics to theoretical physics .
this is a rubens &apos; tube . it &apos;s one of many i &apos;ve made over the years , and i have one here tonight .
you can &apos;t keep a good idea down these days .
they could have put them all out in view .
sl : yes , it is .
we need to check that the temperature has cooled to below 30 degrees c.
and you would think she would take that money and put it back into her education .
there is a millennium development called three that focuses on girls .
now , sylvia browne is the big operator .
they don &apos;t get any information , they don &apos;t get any value for what they spend .
or to have a young woman say to me that she had a lifelong goal of working in a fast-food restaurant .
and they are our responsibility .
so , you see , what is the relationship ?
no other country can do that .
you go up in the short term , and then you go up even more in the long term .
between them , these new revenue flows dwarf aid .
quantum mechanics was developed in the 1920s .
it &apos;s even smaller in scale .
but for me , so is immigration . ( applause ) thank you .
and there &apos;s a lot to be overwhelmed about , to be fair — an environmental crisis , wealth disparity in this country unlike we &apos;ve seen since 1928 , and globally , a totally immoral and ongoing wealth disparity .
how will we ever be interlocutors ?
when mandela came out of prison after 27 years of captivity , if he had told his people , &quot; &quot; it &apos;s time to take up the arms , it &apos;s time to fight , &quot; &quot; he would have been followed .
until about a dozen years ago , when i was really captured by caves , and i really re-focused most of my research in that direction .
so , wonderful things and grim things .
just to finish , they asked me to play that guitar .
this is our spaceship , the soyuz , that little one .
so this petition started to take off — humongously fast , you have no idea .
and this discouraged my brother a lot .
if minds live in bodies , if bodies live in clothes , and then in rooms , and then in buildings , and then in cities , do they also have a final skin , and is that skin perceptual ?
it is objectless . there are no things in it .
will be even more fascinating .
what is your first task ?
and when we took her to the hospital she needed 32 stitches to put back her intestine into her body .
they did not have any pardas inside their body , hijabs inside themselves ; they &apos;ve crossed the barrier of it .
so this movement , if it &apos;s to be durable and global , will have to cross borders , and you will have to see other citizens in democracies , not simply resting on the assumption that their government would do something in the face of genocide , but actually making it such .
and the journalist said , why is there so little response out of washington ?
so then it became quite easy .
scotch tape came out of this program , as well as art fry developed sticky notes from during his personal time for 3m .
put them together , and we &apos;re seeing a wave of astonishing breakthroughs , like robots that do factory work or run as fast as a cheetah or leap tall buildings in a single bound .
no . technology is not destiny .
in one recent study , we asked people to suppose you &apos;re about to get a dog .
the best definition of innateness i &apos;ve ever seen — this just clarifies so many things for me — is from the brain scientist gary marcus .
and this has become such a norm of our professional lives , such a norm and such an expectation .
and it had nothing to do with technical capability .
and if you don &apos;t think you look good in something , you &apos;re also probably right .
exactly one week &apos;s worth of undies is all i put in my suitcase .
but there has been a huge amount of progress .
i was 21 .
what would you do if you knew that people had this misconception , right , in their heads , of elliptical orbits caused by our experiences as children ?
and we intercut it with , &quot; &quot; we are the premier science university in the world , &quot; &quot; because of british-like hubris .
and our values are beginning to unite us . &quot; &quot; only two percent , only two percent of tribes get to stage five .
but we &apos;re not done yet . because then how do we go from stage four , which is great , to stage five ?
in plain english , that means censorship and surveillance of their users .
how do you hold the sovereigns of cyberspace accountable to the public interest when most ceo &apos;s argue that their main obligation is to maximize shareholder profit ?
the answer is actually none of these ; it &apos;s alzheimer &apos;s disease .
at that moment , i was really struck by the power of technology to change lives for the better .
it works through surfaces .
just listen to the sound for a moment .
and fears and storytelling have the same components .
like all stories , fears have characters .
( laughter ) rb : well , i hope it &apos;s net actually , having — ( laughter ) — i &apos;ve got it right .
as somebody who &apos;s dyslexic , you also have some quite bizarre situations .
i &apos;ve also entered in her age , her gender and her height .
now these statistics had a huge impact on me , but what really sparked my interest in my research was watching both my dad and my brother suffer from chronic allergies year-round .
the congolese conflict is the deadliest conflict since world war ii .
she was called isabelle .
it &apos;s very easy to spend money .
why do we have to do this work ?
so in fact , this is a pretty accurate estimate of the number of planets in our galaxy , just in our galaxy , by the way , and i remind the non-astronomy majors among you that our galaxy is only one of 100 billion that we can see with our telescopes .
and so i got interested in electronics , and you know , i studied to get my ham license . i was wiring up stuff .
everything about locally derived products and services , supporting your local neighborhoods , whether it &apos;s cheeses , wines and other products .
the third of the four laws of post-crisis consumerism is about durable living .
now , we spend one half of a percent of that on fusion .
that &apos;s actually not quite true .
is an apollo project of cooperation possible ?
in el salvador , both sides that withdrew from their civil war took moves that had been proven to mirror a prisoner &apos;s dilemma strategy .
see .
i mean , the functional impairment is clear .
i wanted to know why i was letting this take over my life , why i was passionate about it , why were other people reacting so strongly to it .
so as we ponder the future , know that your future might not be so seamless .
there &apos;s the stamen and the pistil . but look what the stamen and the pistil look like in a microscope . that &apos;s the stamen .
as you go farther down this scale here , that &apos;s a micron , or a micrometer , and we go all the way down to here to a nanometer and an angstrom . now , an angstrom is the size of the diameter of a hydrogen atom .
and if you look at the figures up there , it says that we have a third more mouths to feed , but we need an agricultural production increase of 70 percent .
and they &apos;re being made in the most wonderful ways .
and it &apos;s at this new frontier that we are forced with a new appraisal .
and we &apos;ve come a long way in the last 60 years .
so chemists got to work , and they developed a bactericide that became widely used in those systems .
now think of the large and small plagues that we have now — bed bugs , killer bees , spam — and it &apos;s very possible that the solutions to those will really extend well beyond the immediate question .
say her name .
only if the court was able to see how these policies came together would he be able to see the double discrimination that emma degraffenreid was facing .
and whenever we saw a flock of birds that had electronic communication , we thought , &apos; probably has something to do with the americans . &apos; &quot; &quot; and i said , &quot; &quot; yeah .
and that &apos;s going to keep happening .
and finally , a lot a people aren &apos;t privy to this , but the doodle is a precursor to some of our greatest cultural assets .
so here is my point : under no circumstances should doodling be eradicated from a classroom or a boardroom or even the war room .
how many people are trying to learn english worldwide ?
s ( yelling more loudly ) : i want to change my life !
and , third , they put the refrigerated goods behind closed doors with led lighting .
and you know what ? most consumers who have them don &apos;t even know it .
either it &apos;s just like that . there is no explanation .
the reason why entropy increases is simply because there are many more ways to be high entropy than to be low entropy .
so there goes my theory of necrophilia .
so after six years , my friends and colleagues urged me to publish , so i published &quot; &quot; the first case of homosexual necrophilia in the mallard . &quot; &quot; and here &apos;s the situation again .
so if we could figure out what cells they are , we could maybe find new targets for which drugs could be designed or screened against , or maybe places where electrodes could be put in for people who have very severe disability .
think about your day for a second .
today &apos;s question is : why ?
but a lot of the learning that i did in high school wasn &apos;t about what happened inside the classroom , it was about what happened outside of the classroom .
and lima sahar was a finalist in the afghan star singing competition .
and for afghanistan , where the taliban banned music for many years , it is reintroducing their traditional music .
an implicit faith in you and then you respond to it .
maybe there is — the solution to the cost could be in productivity , maybe in efficiency , in the clinical process , or in how much they pay for the lenses or consumables , or regulations , their defensive practice .
we had to deal with composite images that were merging photos from previous storms .
any event that happens anywhere in the world , i should be able to know about it pretty much instantaneously , as it happens , for free .
( applause )
what they found on monday was evidence of the ringing of the space-time of the early universe , what we call gravitational waves from the fundamental era , and here &apos;s how they found it .
did i mention they &apos;re gorgeous ?
but that &apos;s not even all of it , because once a drug is approved , tissue engineering techniques can actually help us develop more personalized treatments .
but if you think about it , what is normal ?
imagine if that was the best compliment you ever received .
it &apos;s victimless . it &apos;s meat from a test tube .
and what we do is we grow extracellular matrix from pigs .
amazed people . the glory and bounty that is bronx county .
and this is what my kids are doing , making living wage .
now , this air comes with an ethical dimension as well .
for me , air is plural .
that &apos;s what i do .
astrology , for instance : like many rationalists , i &apos;m a pisces .
that is larger than , or almost similar to , the total aid budget of the united states government , the largest donor on the planet .
monthly remittances , on average , to somalia is larger than that amount .
giant corporations operate on a global level .
think about it : 11.5 million documents , containing the secrets of people from more than 200 different countries .
we can pick up and fly to the deepest place : seven miles down , the mariana trench , where only two people have ever been .
it &apos;s one of my favorite bathing suits .
thank you . ( applause ) ( applause ) tom rielly : so max , by taking all these samples of , let &apos;s say , 10,000 people , you &apos;ll be able to tell who &apos;s healthy and who &apos;s not ?
you don &apos;t have to design a whole new set of hospitals to do it .
wish us luck .
but when you grow objects like this , the properties are invariant with the print direction .
so 80 percent of the world &apos;s employment in the developed world is stuff that computers have just learned how to do .
and here is some text that an algorithm out of stanford generated .
he understood that there &apos;s a difference between the medical condition and what someone might do with it .
there &apos;s common , there &apos;s typical . there &apos;s no normal , and would you want to meet that poor , beige person if they existed ?
she didn &apos;t care where .
i was concerned about making a place for the study of law .
and then the adult , which comes after , lives for one or two months .
but it &apos;s a pretty miserable place to be in the winter .
we did not stop there .
but their lives ended up differently , in two different paths .
this is a land yacht racing across the desert in nevada .
it &apos;s got an amazing user experience .
you couldn &apos;t suddenly tell everyone , &quot; &quot; ok , remember what you used to do at yield signs ? now do something different . &quot; &quot; that would not work .
that intersection i looked at had about 3,000 cars per day in each direction , and so that &apos;s two ounces of gas to accelerate out of .
good afternoon , good evening , whatever .
so it &apos;s pretty sad to find that chimpanzees , like so many other creatures around the world , are losing their habitats .
and i was with a big guy named skip , and he was on the nozzle , and i was right behind , and it was a typical sort of fire .
so i was short of the 12-and-a-half-mile record .
but we have a very pessimistic approach about the cities .
if you cut two zeros , it &apos;s much better .
it &apos;s not an elegant universe . ( laughter ) and then there &apos;s the best of all possible worlds in an ethical sense .
it &apos;s as far removed from nothingness as it could possibly be .
( video ) hyowon gweon : see this ? ( ball squeaks ) did you see that ? ( ball squeaks ) cool .
again , the baby &apos;s going to have a choice .
every day was about creating something new .
it &apos;s about changing our frontiers .
let &apos;s take a closer look at how we can build this nanoparticle .
and we can put different drugs into the nanoparticle core .
it took all of my strength not to raise my head and howl .
i admit the sight of the leash would excite me , but only because it meant i was about to smell things you had never touched .
my personal hope is that you &apos;ll become an astrophysicist , but beyond that , anything you want .
one hundred percent of the 60 women of color interviewed in a recent study by joan c. williams at uc hastings reported facing racialized gender bias , including being mistaken for the janitorial staff .
( laughter ) idiot , robbins .
so , think about your own life , the decisions that have shaped your destiny .
i love this .
and what i &apos;ve found is that our little devices , those little devices in our pockets , are so psychologically powerful that they don &apos;t only change what we do , they change who we are .
they wouldn &apos;t experience restraints as we would . &quot; &quot; i didn &apos;t have the courage to tell him in that moment that , no , we &apos;re not that different from him .
&apos;we &apos;ve got to case the joint .
but as a dysfunctional , as a dysfunctional murderer / psychotic , he &apos;s something much more complicated .
he was particularly proud of the comfortable seat , really comfortable seat he had made in his chariot and its beautiful fabric fringe around the edge .
management did not emanate from nature .
autonomy : the urge to direct our own lives .
and what is that , structurally ?
it &apos;s a powerful thing . it &apos;s like magic , almost , like the magicians we &apos;ve seen at ted . it &apos;s magic .
what we &apos;re asking and looking for is , are there a very few set of individuals who are actually walking around with the risk that normally would cause a disease , but something in them , something hidden in them is actually protective and keeping them from exhibiting those symptoms ?
they didn &apos;t get aids .
so , what do we need to know in order to predict ?
ok , so i &apos;d like you to take a little away from this .
and he says , &quot; &quot; god , you really did want it . you wanted my bread .
who cannot be touched by compassion when we see the terrible horrors of the results of war , or famine , or earthquakes , or tsunamis ?
and what we saw yesterday was every reaction was fortuitous ; they just swooped in the air and bound , and something happened .
so one of the things that goes from simple to complex is when we do more . we like more .
coming back quickly , we see here the radio sphere that we jumped out of in the beginning , but these are positions , the latest positions of exoplanets that we &apos;ve mapped , and our sun here , obviously , with our own solar system .
we &apos;re actually sharing tours of the universe with the first sub-saharan planetarium in ghana as well as new libraries that have been built in the ghettos in columbia and a high school in cambodia .
ca : how about you , melinda , though ? can you ? ( laughter ) you never know .
how have you managed it ?
a third migrated to persia .
in spite of the very clear anti-israeli ideology of the new regime , the geopolitical logic for their collaboration lived on , because they still had common threats .
it allows us to test things as an entrepreneur , to go to market , to be in conversation with people , listen , refine something and go back .
there &apos;s a pop-up general store every three weeks , and they do a fantastic job of making a very social event happening for foodies .
this is a clever solution , right ?
well , modern agriculture simply cannot sustainably scale to meet that demand .
neural activity is constantly changing .
your sequence and mine are slightly different .
it does this by harnessing a mechanism that already existed in bacteria .
but that &apos;s not always the case .
and then , from there , he climbed directly up the bark until he got to the top of the tree .
children are incredibly adept at climbing trees .
and this isn &apos;t just a problem in britain .
well , what is the answer to this ? is the answer to just give up on the idea of democracy ?
so they started flying them at high altitudes at incredibly high speeds .
you know what the answer was ?
did you do enough , and are you ok , momma ?
were you fooled by the epithets of &quot; &quot; nasty &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; less than &quot; &quot; ?
well , let &apos;s put a decade with elon musk into a little perspective .
the answer lies here , at the south pole and at the north pole of mars , both of which are covered with an incredible amount of frozen carbon dioxide — dry ice .
and this is our beast of burden — this is a computer tomography machine , a ct machine .
as long as kids are playing computer games , graphics is getting better and better and better .
tm : thank you very much .
( music ) ( applause ) tm : thank you , thank you . ( applause )
could there be order in the chaos that i created ?
so as you can see , we are always solving .
and , of course , of course , we tackled the big stuff , like rehauling the entire school budget so that we can reallocate funds to have more teachers and support staff .
this is not a school . &quot; &quot; in one outburst , ashley had expressed what i felt and never quite was able to articulate about my own experience when i attended a low-performing school in the same neighborhood , many , many , many years earlier .
so , i wanted to show you something .
you know . what about safety ?
so you see , i &apos;d missed fitting in to just about every category out there : daughter , wife , mother , scholar .
i can pick you out of a room .
through this experience that could only be created in a museum , i &apos;d opened up the eyes of my audience — historians , artists , press , the general public — to the beauty of this lost medium .
now , in our galleries , we show 14 centuries of the development of different islamic cultures across a vast geographic spread , and , again , hundreds of thousands of people have come to see these galleries since they opened last october .
for real , it &apos;s very secret , he won &apos;t tell you about it .
money to buy the kids clothes as they were growing .
it &apos;s like a video game obstacle course . and i &apos;ve gotten better and better at doing this . even when i make a painting , i actually imagine i &apos;m behind the painting , it already exists , and someone &apos;s looking at it , and i see whether they &apos;re feeling it from their gut .
it really teaches us who we are , and helps us contextualize ourselves in the world , but it &apos;s really my creativity that &apos;s taught me that i can be much more than what my education told me i am .
everything we blog , everything we tweet , and everything we click is a public act of making media .
in an increasingly noisy media landscape , the incentive is to make more noise to be heard , and that tyranny of the loud encourages the tyranny of the nasty .
we were so much bigger than coca-cola in those days .
and we gave every station half a minute extra for advertising to earn more money .
we know plants have a fundamental role to play .
i call it benjoin in the local vernacular , and the botanical name is terminalia bentzoe , subspecies bentzoe .
now , here &apos;s a macro forecast that &apos;s easy to make , and that &apos;s , that gap between the wealthiest and the poorest , it will get closed .
capitalism has to be based on justice .
and the reason is , it &apos;s been done .
it didn &apos;t even talk about cutting emissions , which is an incredible shift in our thinking about this problem .
the other thing that &apos;s happened , which was good for us , is the internet .
it &apos;s a beautiful building . we decided we would refurbish it and then put out the word : we &apos;re going to start the best math institute in africa in this hotel .
cl : joseph is phenomenal . he &apos;s brilliant .
you don &apos;t actually have to hear it .
and i played the first movement of the beethoven violin concerto .
( applause ) bruno giussani : thank you . thanks .
and i can &apos;t claim for sure that the optical source brought it in , because there &apos;s bait right there .
it &apos;s unbelievable .
that , i think , is movement .

about 200 years before , francis bacon and then , later , isaac newton , had proposed an inductive scientific method .
in the days before pocket calculators , the numbers that most professionals needed — bankers , insurance agents , ship captains , engineers — were to be found in lookup books like this , filled with tables of figures .
she launches this thing above the spanish steps and sets off for an aerial tour of the city .

which ensure that over five percent of the province &apos;s gdp is accounted for by this trade .
nowadays , adam and eve would probably act differently .

all the evidence suggested that this devil cancer was spread by a virus .

i said , &quot; &quot; but wouldn &apos;t somebody pay you for that ? &quot; &quot; and he goes , &quot; &quot; maybe . &quot; &quot; remember at 10 years old — so 34 years ago i saw opportunity in this stuff .
it &apos;s an average of about five tons for everyone on the planet .
some individual services even bring it down by 90 percent .

so imagine that policymakers outlined a facility .
pw : blessing and curse .
i had a girl who came up who said , &quot; &quot; my dad says you &apos;re the devil . &quot; &quot; you cannot take people &apos;s aliens away from them and expect to be anybody &apos;s friends .

on-site , i take thousands of photographs .
abolish all doubt , and what &apos;s left is not faith , but absolute , heartless conviction .
but one thing is sure : call it human .
in the laboratory what we want to do is much the same , but with on the order of tens of different types of molecules — so a drastic reduction in complexity , but still trying to produce something that looks lifelike .
basically what that means is , you have an input of energy into the system that life can use and exploit to maintain itself .
and i realized just what had happened to me at swarthmore , this transformation — the ability to confront problems , complex problems , and to design solutions to those problems .
the question of transformation in africa really is a question of leadership .
and he said one of them is called maluma .
it &apos;s about mappings between different perceptual domains , like hardness , sharpness , brightness and darkness , and the phonemes that we &apos;re able to speak with .
it &apos;s amazing . so this is the power of spectroscopy .
we can actually study line-of-sight velocities of cosmic objects .
and the visuals you &apos;re about to see are not prerecorded .
the finale defies logic , gives new insight into the problem , and audiences express their amazement with laughter .

mw : so we presented this good idea to dr. lindsay eltis at the university of british columbia , and surprisingly , he actually took us into his lab and asked his graduate students adam and james to help us .
little did we know at that time that a trip to the dump and some research on the internet and plucking up the courage to act upon inspiration would take us on a life-changing journey of accidents and discoveries .
so why can &apos;t the energy of anger be translated and harnessed to create a better and beautiful world , a more just and equitable world ?

they begin to chant .
and it got me wondering : if you took all this data and put it through statistical analysis , could you reverse engineer a tedtalk ?
( laughter ) ( applause ) whereas , if you wanted to talk about your project involving oxygen , girls , aircraft — actually , i would like to hear that talk , ( laughter ) but statistics say it &apos;s not so good .
this is a large pulley made by sandwiching rubber between two old cds .
there are six layers — three layers of plastic , aluminum — which are are sealed together .
and then in the midst of all this came this new context for thinking about what it meant to be good .
go a couple generations forward to where we are , though , and it looks like a completely different world .
( laughter ) so , i &apos;m thinking the universe is either a dodecahedron or a cheeseburger .
this is again , indicating how numbers relate to space relate to form , maps of the universe .
it means that violence , the rule of warriors and despotic chiefs , the conditions of camps and warfare , of riot and tyranny , give place to parliaments where laws are made , and independent courts of justice in which over long periods those laws are maintained .
the financial crisis is really a relatively small historic phenomenon , which has just accelerated this huge shift , which ends half a millennium of western ascendancy .

and i &apos;ve learned that this really has to change .
with the millions of visitors that come every year , it &apos;s actually one of the best places to try to invent the museum of the future .
imagine an immersive system that permits to go and dive and reconstruct the venice of a given year , some experience you could share within a group .

what we &apos;re looking at now — i &apos;m going to add in the community of some people with c. diff .
so the funeral ceremony itself embodies this relational perspective on death .
so where we see an unquestionable reality , death as an irrefutable biological condition , torajans see the expired corporeal form as part of a larger social genesis .
and we did so by analyzing the recorded speech of 34 young people who were at a high risk of developing schizophrenia .
so our way to solve this is to build the space of words .
what we can control is how we spend our days , the spaces we create , the meaning and joy that we make .
a friend of mine raises camels at his ranch in the santa cruz mountains .
and that &apos;s how i &apos;ll use my 100,000-dollar prize money .

preston reed : it &apos;s mind-blowing , and i feel really proud , really honored .
one more time , ten times further away .
it &apos;s about 10 billion times dimmer than it was before , and we can see the planets beam out just like that .
so let &apos;s think of another example : working with children in care .
actually , for creating social change , we need to bring in the expertise from all of those parties in order to make this work .
but that was my first real experience as a solo singer-songwriter .
and having the stage fright song let me get past that biggest issue right in the beginning of a performance .
&quot; &quot; no , i don &apos;t know that atheists should be considered citizens , nor should they be considered patriots .
i &apos;ve not seen corresponding figures for elite scholars in other fields , such as history or philosophy , but i &apos;d be surprised if they were different .
and it &apos;s truly global .
that problem of competing claims is mitigated .
( music ) ( applause )
i not only play at the prestigious classical concert halls like carnegie hall and kennedy center , but also hospitals , churches , prisons , and restricted facilities for leprosy patients , just to mention a few .
you think of yourself as the servant .
i mean , i &apos;ve got the symptoms .
what he did was see what was happening in israel , larger approaches , and figure out how to do a drip irrigation , which is a way of bringing water directly to the plant stock .
until one day in ninth grade , when i was standing with a number of the football players .
when i had to open the school in the refugee camp , i went to see the imam .
one night , she had a dream .
and i wrote them down and i found out later that every one of them was a little kid in that wonderful renaissance of aviation .
ok , i want to show you kind of a busy chart , but in it is my prediction with what &apos;s going to happen .
but the volumes are much larger than ever .
leave that up to us .
these self-regulating , semi-autonomous units give rise to self-regulating , semi-autonomous units called organs , and these organs coalesce to form things called humans , and these organisms ultimately live in environments , which are partly self-regulating and partly semi-autonomous .
could we imagine that for our future ?
and this has been a smooth progression since the beginning of the genome project .
spatial resolution of brain scanning is doubling every year .
take janette .
it took me a while , but i learned it eventually .
over the next few days , his head was swollen with abscesses , and in fact his eye was so infected that they had to take it out , and by february of 1941 , this poor man was on the verge of dying .
they were starting to run out of penicillin , so what they would do was run with his urine across the road to re-synthesize the penicillin from his urine and give it back to him , and that worked .
but it was interesting because i had some very preconceived notions about , for instance , evangelical christianity , and i found that it &apos;s such a wide and varied movement that it is difficult to make generalizations about it .
and finally i learned that thou shall pick and choose .
the largest set piece in the opera is called the system . it &apos;s a series of books .
i think that &apos;s true for many of us , and i want to give you two examples of how music is one of the most powerful interfaces we have , from ourselves to the outside world .
so this means that both spiders and spider silk have been around for 380 million years .
so for example this would be one sentence , and you would get this sort of green region and the red polyalanine , that repeats over and over and over again , and you can have that hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of times within an individual silk molecule .
ace of diamonds .
so — oh , jack of spades .
it &apos;s just a sick , silly joke .
it &apos;s the ascent of man using an escalator , and it &apos;s in three parts .
the internet is the first medium in history that has native support for groups and conversation at the same time .
the media was produced locally . it was produced by amateurs .
and at that point , actually , a firework went off in my brain .
two years ago , i have to say there was no problem .
as long as it &apos;s fun and it seems like it &apos;s going to be a funny idea and it seems like the people who witness it will also have a fun time , then that &apos;s enough for us .
i &apos;m wearing a hat . i &apos;m wearing a scarf .
thank you .
currently , the new narrative about braddock , a poster child for rust belt revitalization , is a story of urban pioneers discovering a new frontier .
well , first , let &apos;s be honest : there are differences .
remember what pulled up the poor .
and then her oldest brother stood up and said , &quot; &quot; i too have something to tell you .
and so in redefining the health care teams by bringing the mentor mothers in , we can do that .
( laughter ) and we had to take action . now our kids found out about it .
now i said , &quot; &quot; okay , so what ? we have lizzie . &quot; &quot; she goes , &quot; &quot; no it gets worse , read this book . &quot; &quot; and here is this &quot; &quot; killed strangely , &quot; &quot; and it &apos;s this historical book .
it can transform the thing that might have made people fearful into something that invites them to look , and look a little longer , and maybe even understand .
and , from my experience , you know , kids are naturally curious about what they don &apos;t know , or don &apos;t understand , or is foreign to them .
a cheery thought .
if you want to lower your risk of parkinson ’ s disease , caffeine is protective to some extent ; nobody knows why .
and it &apos;s in every cell .
made it go 10 percent faster on 15 percent less electricity .
thank you so much .
now , a tar kettle doesn &apos;t sound like much of an inheritance . it wasn &apos;t .
i &apos;ll show you an example of brazil .
and you &apos;re absolutely right .
( music ) &#91; sanskrit &#93; this is an ode to the mother goddess , that most of us in india learn when we are children .
my story is the power of a metaphor .
but my son &apos;s death was not purely a suicide .
thank you .
let &apos;s take a look .
it was an experience of being totally in awe of the music , and i had not felt that in a long time .
and every time the hula hoop would smush against her body , it would connect two little pieces of copper tape , and it would make a sound , and the next sound , and it would loop the same sounds over and over again .
and i &apos;ll just hook up the forward arrow .
we decided to employ as many disabled as possible to train them in any possible job .
everybody benefits from that — those employed , of course , because they get a job and dignity .
it could be a geyser .
i can &apos;t move my body to the beat , and after a scientist who became a philosopher , i have to talk about hard science .
certainly , if in the future we learn there is an area of the human brain that lights up when one curses oneself , i won &apos;t be at all surprised .
we didn &apos;t see a sunset either .
they had been using nonviolence for about two years but had grown disenchanted since nobody was paying attention .
israeli man : the fence has , in fact , created a solution to terror .
so let &apos;s think about how we manage our money .
a lot of people buy the biggest house they can afford , and actually slightly bigger than that .
our story , therefore , needs two dimensions of time : a long arc of time that is our lifespan , and the timeframe of direct experience that is the moment .
we might run up the stairs too quickly and we might get breathless .
and it &apos;s findings like this that we believe hold some of the clues for why we see these very significant sex differences in depression .
and these symptoms are often overlooked as symptoms of depression .
you have to have physical structure .
and the actual goal of the institution goes to two through n .
so what i plan to do with this technology is to actually take the current state of the technology and build an hiv kit in a microfluidic system .
but what electronic miniaturization has done is that it has allowed people to shrink technology into a cell phone .
the original decoration of this church reflected a smaller world .
we don &apos;t really have any of that there .
in a blog post , she positioned bilal bot as a new , inexpensive and beta alternative to the much more advanced gm bot that was commonplace in the criminal underground .
we make cybercrime not pay .
wi-fi enables you to avoid the processor . and there are some enhanced protection measures , which i would like to share with you , and i would like , in a minute , to thank philips for helping .
this is a very serious research , that you should read the underline .
you &apos;ve heard of dna ; you probably studied a little bit in biology .
what &apos;s happening in genomics , and how this revolution is about to change everything we know about the world , life , ourselves , and how we think about them .
thank you all .
♫ that the guy who took his beer ♫ ♫ was a guy dressed like me . ♫ ♫ not me ! ♫ ♫ not me ! ♫ ♫ not me ! ♫ thank you .
they cause different things to happen inside the cell .
in fact , it would really , in the absence of these machines , have made the attendance here , chris , really quite sparse .
play a real quiet grooming song .
they imitated on their own .
as it went off , i took off and safely got to the other side .
paramount amongst those was the realization that , actually , cities are fantastic places for the blind .
and second , and probably the more reflective one , is just about how much each of us can hold problems in opposition when they &apos;re really not that way .
sitting is so incredibly prevalent , we don &apos;t even question how much we &apos;re doing it , and because everyone else is doing it , it doesn &apos;t even occur to us that it &apos;s not okay .
let us draw to a close this era of meta-narratives .
i don &apos;t need to elaborate for this audience how dysfunctional it is , from washington to european capitals .
the data structure of thought .
so , who told ? i told .
they &apos;ve created jobs .
it creates new demand , new jobs .
they &apos;re our memory-keepers and our histories , the last thing we would grab and the first thing you &apos;d go back to look for .
during this time , we hadn &apos;t really spent more than about a thousand dollars in equipment and materials , most of which was printer inks .
and as one police chief in the washington , dc area recently told me , people don &apos;t actually get radicalized at mosques .
it can actually be a tool of public manipulation , eroding the very foundation of a free society , which is rational and well-informed citizens .
vultures also have tremendous historical significance .
they are very graceful . charles darwin said he changed his mind because he watched them fly effortlessly without energy in the skies .
and she wrote about her life dealing with cancer .
you &apos;re just like your dad , &quot; &quot; who collects instruments .
thank you . ( applause )
four years ago today , exactly , actually , i started a fashion blog called style rookie .
and that is , quite simply , to have nothing to remember .
and we do all this — and to go back to the original question , what do people carry ?
and although western women love to give us poor , oppressed arab women advice , they live different lives with different constraints .
i apply this lesson equally well to my personal life .
i therefore want to encourage public interest in space . &quot; &quot; we took him out to the kennedy space center , up inside the nasa vehicle , into the back of the zero-g airplane .
it took us 11 years to become operational .
so what i &apos;m first going to show you is air that we sampled outside of the building .
if you look at classrooms right adjacent to one another , they have very similar ecosystems , but if you go to an office that is a farther walking distance away , the ecosystem is fundamentally different .
now hang on a minute .
but how many of you would be able to make a confident assertion about a piece of classical music ?
one thing you might get is something like the luminous room .
so the computation is space soluble and network soluble .
using the first head , which is our laser , we will make an incision in the site of infection .
&quot; &quot; how is that possible ? &quot; &quot; you may ask .
now , we live in times of incredible change .
yes , it &apos;s hard .
she was 16 years old last year when i met her , and she aspired to be a professional dancer .
and before i tell you about how it is that we think that happens and what we can do about it , i want to show you how it feels for my patients .
once we define the problem , we can prevent that death with something as cheap and safe as penicillin .
we can do that because then we &apos;ll know .
because what it pays attention to is what it &apos;s seeing and interacting with , and what you &apos;re understanding what it &apos;s doing .
they &apos;re just machines , after all .
you know , an example of something — pregnancy .
so this change , i believe , is a huge disruptive change .
but it has to be done together .
this is the modus operandi that we have today .
it &apos;s our home . we welcome them .
and as you can see , it &apos;s the women who are carrying the children ; it &apos;s the women who come into the hospitals ; it &apos;s the women &#91; are &#93; building the houses .
( laughter ) we embrace you , we embrace you .
i made it publicly available , and it wasn &apos;t even open source at that point .
the crowd goes wild .
so , here &apos;s the shot .
i don &apos;t think anyone does .
two years ago , with a group of friends from argentina , we started thinking , &quot; &quot; how can we get our representatives , our elected representatives , to represent us ? &quot; &quot; marshall mcluhan once said that politics is solving today &apos;s problems with yesterday &apos;s tools .
behind the destruction , i found a soul of places .
what do we know about the death threats by the taliban nailed on the doors of the people who dare to send their daughters to school as in balkh ?
the amount of a moderate-to-severe snow melting of an area equivalent to the size of california .
but , as important as it is to change the lightbulbs , it is more important to change the laws .
( applause )
and then it was abandoned .
now in our community , when we get up off the ground , we stand with our hands raised to the heavens , and we say , &quot; &quot; i am strong , i am mighty , and i am worthy .
religion is waning in the united states .
but under that was this global tension of will we ever find nemo in this huge , vast ocean ?
daddy &apos;s got you .
what &apos;s really going on ?
and then gradually gentrifies .
and then i got wind of the fact that in egypt , they were using this term &quot; &quot; mutabi ’ , &quot; &quot; which means &quot; &quot; to follow . &quot; &quot; so we were now having followers of an election .
for example — i mean , it &apos;s a country the size of texas , more or less .
they &apos;re obscure , weird programs .
and some of those drops of oil had a particular combination of chemicals in them which caused them to incorporate chemicals from the outside and grow the drops of oil .
listen , i &apos;m excited about baltimore today , because we , as many cities , i believe shall rise from the ashes .
but we have exercised that arm so much , so very much .
i &apos;ve met a young man in new york whose illiterate mother in a village in senegal takes a bus once a month to the capital city of dakar , just to watch a bollywood movie .
and we continue to grow . when the rest of the world took a beating last year , we grew at 6.7 percent .
my company has 70 million images .
these gorillas were murdered , some would even say crucified , and unsurprisingly , they sparked international outrage .
so if you come across a problem that grabs you , let it keep you up at night .
because what &apos;s the difference ?
it is every time , every single important issue .
i mean , after all , at least 96 percent of us wish we could fly like superman , but because at least 91 percent of us believe we can &apos;t , we don &apos;t leap off of tall buildings every time we have that urge .
that &apos;s what one of these chips really looks like , and these red spots are , in fact , signals coming from the virus .
we put the beeper in the clinic .
you can open your eyes now .
to give you a sense of how much it is , i want to share with you a demonstration conceived by sports scientist ross tucker .
i want to talk to you about fear .
the only thing they &apos;re missing is that it takes a good crisis to get us going .
the impact was great .
then i got a scoop .
and so this — you can see that you &apos;re paying considerably less than the health care costs on the tax .
i mean , we &apos;ve essentially been exporting oil spills when we import oil from places without tight environmental regulations .
so it &apos;s very easy for either humans or machines to separate these metals from one another and from other materials .
( laughter ) well after spending about 20 years in the recycling industry , it &apos;s become pretty clear to me that we don &apos;t necessarily leave these toddler rules behind as we develop into adults .
so , i &apos;m really interested in you learning how to make your own puzzles as well as just me creating them .
here &apos;s the word &quot; &quot; mirror . &quot; &quot; no , it &apos;s not the same upside-down .
we &apos;re all familiar with his fantastic work — his drawings , his paintings , his inventions , his writings .
so we can eliminate all the profiles .
they didn &apos;t find it .
what if there was something to this fountain of youth ?
we use it a lot , we &apos;re choosing to laugh in a lot of situations , and it seems to be its own thing .
laughter is always meaningful .
what it means in terms of the distances between them , how they will start to feel separate from each other and just the logistics of the time .
so you can see from this image of the control room that all of the blinds are down .
california is expected to lose 25 percent of its species in the next 40 years .
we don &apos;t really have the technology to predict comet trajectories , or when one with our name on it might arrive .
that &apos;s really bad for the worker .
you &apos;re in and out of traffic all day , and it &apos;s zooming around you .
td : so , even though i &apos;m somewhat happy about the wonderful developments that are happening in the world , still , i feel a sense of impediment , when it comes to the ability that we have to connect with each other on a heart-to-heart , or a mind-to-mind , level .
i was feeling under the weather and dizzy and so forth , and people would ask me , why .
we just haven &apos;t had the tools to look at interacting brains simultaneously .
canaries used to be used as kind of biosensors in mines .
we &apos;re going to save money , we &apos;re going to avoid delays and disruptions , and bottom line , we &apos;re going to save lives .
in rome , at the world food programme , this took us five years to do , five years .
the hunger and thirst was , and still remains : how do i get people who hate poetry to love me ?
waited until it was just the right time , followed him very closely behind .
what this is telling us is that we need to first establish a middle class that is able to hold the government accountable .
this is an affidavit from the zambian government .
the fact that it happens in &quot; &quot; another country &quot; &quot; takes you quite by surprise .
giraffes are this desire in the dark . &quot; &quot; this is important .
so when i heard that the translator , gregory rabassa , had written his own book on the subject , i couldn &apos;t wait to read it .
it &apos;s highly recommended for anyone who &apos;s interested in the translator &apos;s art .
( applause )
what we see , however , are two overlapping triangles .
the one thing i &apos;ll call your attention to right away is the little musical note above the female chimp and bonobo and human .
but i &apos;m not saying they were having sex with strangers .
you know what ? we should be ashamed .
and that has to change , you know .
because we &apos;re using escalators to move people , all of these trusses are picking up diagonal loads .
that &apos;s because we &apos;re all using calculus tools for manufacturing and for design .
and so the two of us are here to give you an example of creation .
and rufus is going to be doing some improvisation on his custom , five-string electric cello , and it &apos;s very exciting to listen to him .
and i tried again and again , conference after conference , but i wasn &apos;t getting through .
if a is the question , and b is the answer , then research is a direct path .
now , in order to do this we need to invest about 180 billion dollars : half of it to retool the car , truck and plane industries ; half of it to build the advanced bio-fuel industry .
for example , we use a lot of carbon-fiber composites in sporting goods .
and with some look-alikes , they are so good you don &apos;t know whether they &apos;re real or not .
all this imagery was creating a lot of fuss and i was cited as a disgusting artist . the press were writing about this , giving full pages about how terrible this was .
do these cells also help a monkey to recover after a lesion ?
they divide slowly , and after a few weeks of culture , they even died .
but that would have ended up with a lot of awful kickback and a hell of a lot of resistance .
now , we basically have to change our views slightly .
tons of studies were done to see if this was true .
but you know what ?
in environmental circles , we often hear that , rather than shifting to renewables , we are continuing with business as usual .
i spent a week at sea on a research vessel .
and my favorite example is always fingers .
and another advantage , of course , of using fingers is you have 10 of them .
do you think that if there was a culture of clarity in the financial sector things would have got up to where they &apos;ve got ?
and above all , it is a right , it is everyone &apos;s right .
and the other thing you might argue is , &quot; &quot; well , car seats have got a lot better over time .
so if you look at that data — it &apos;s right up on the national highway transportation safety administration &apos;s website — you can just look at the raw data , and begin to get a sense of the limited amount of evidence that &apos;s in favor of car seats for children aged two and up .
to give you a sense of scale , this is about a mile wide .
the difference between the dinosaurs and us is that we have a space program and we can vote , and so we can change our future .
here &apos;s an example of a project using the microphone .
so i showed him .
so the other thing i thought about there in my bedroom that night was , &quot; &quot; how could i have done that ?
because we all know people who have gotten tattoos when they were 17 or 19 or 23 and regretted it by the time they were 30 .
i didn &apos;t have the rest of my life to do this project .
but he didn &apos;t have wikipedia .
and while i was surprised that so many people just like me waste so much energy trying to hide themselves , i was scared when i discovered that my silence has life-or-death consequences and long-term social repercussions .
how does her father feel ?
like , just , go out , and , you know , do your best .
living in new york city , as i do , it &apos;s almost as if , with so many people doing so many things at the same time in such close quarters , it &apos;s almost like life is dealing you extra hands out of that deck .
and in this particular case i happened to like one of them on the merits of music literacy in schools and i shared it over a social network .
i have navigated to a total of four .
take what may be the most important invention of modern times : programmable computers .
but that is exactly what our ancestors did .
sometimes you do this data and this work with real-time data to illuminate a specific problem in a specific city .
what you &apos;re seeing on the screen here is a collaboration i did with an artist named lián amaris .
and i &apos;m just going to tell you , sometimes those contacts are very strange , slightly unexpected , and the very most interesting , let me put it that way , contact that i had , was actually from a team of american footballers that all wanted to have double-thickness skulls made on their head .
so it creates , in essence , an artificial cavity that is right next to both the bone but also this really rich layer of stem cells .
you might think that it &apos;s quite hard to find new stories and new subjects , but new technology is changing the way we can film .
there are so many wonderful places .
and not tough in the sense that most people think of , where your parents yell at you or hit you or whatever .
and the power of connecting people and ideas can be pretty awesome .
and i know i &apos;ve performed for some of your companies or some of you have seen me elsewhere , but this is honestly one of the best audiences i &apos;ve ever experienced .
like , it &apos;s — i can &apos;t get over this right now .
or are you more of a down attribute ?
why is it important to reboot ? what does the red represent ?
and it went like this : wake up well rested after a good night &apos;s sleep .
the second observation i &apos;d like to make is we need to face the truth that governments and corporations aren &apos;t going to solve this issue for us .
we also all have very different susceptibilities .
the problem is when we begin to feel fear and anxiety in situations that don &apos;t call for it .
time for some thermodynamics .
so , it was a great idea that didn &apos;t work at all : it blew up .
which fact is not true ?
five : i served as a law clerk to two us supreme court justices .
so i got this ugly brown envelope with a c.d. inside .
i want to make them public .
it &apos;s a civil rights problem .
apple has spent a lot of time and money to make sure that its products are as secure as possible .
each one of those is an opportunity to do something about it ; it &apos;s an opportunity for the technology to change .
and what &apos;s interesting here is that something else took off along with it : home-theater units .
and i &apos;d be wrong to dis that completely .
( laughter ) it &apos;s those people i &apos;d quite like to create in the world going forward .
we understand that these will become much more virulent , that what we see today is this interweaving of societies , of systems , fastened by technologies and hastened by just-in-time management systems .
so forget about retirements if you &apos;re young .
but you can take the idea of a model system too far .
virgin birth , right there .
and the cool thing about fluorescence is that it &apos;s not only bright , it actually can shine through tissue .
so they added two additional components .
on one side you were talking with people around the table — and that was a nice , constructive discussion .
and one internet economist told me that that meant that google made somewhere between 120,000 dollars and 468,000 dollars from justine &apos;s annihilation , whereas those of us doing the actual shaming — we got nothing .
that said , poetry does seem to be especially good at certain things .
stevens saves that sonically odd word &quot; &quot; meditation &quot; &quot; for the end .
but i didn &apos;t get it .
and we use the word &quot; &quot; nothing . &quot; &quot; nothing doesn &apos;t exist , because there is always something .
this one is about what happens to the air we breathe .
( laughter ) what did the poor do wrong ?
the redder light from the sun is absorbed on its way through the ice .
the reality totally contradicted initial perceptions of this planet .
and when i came home , i found the scope of my existence gradually diminishing until loading the dishwasher seemed like an interesting challenge .
i &apos;m already beyond the lifespan of most hunter-gatherers , and the outcome of a mortal combat between me myopically stumbling around with a stone-tipped spear and an enraged giant aurochs isn &apos;t very hard to predict .
he also takes on the government for its failure to do more to prevent poverty in his community .
she &apos;s been in the post since 2008 and actually opened an office to investigate cases of violence against women , which she says is the most important area in her mandate .
here is a wonderful image of one of my rescuers , andy , and i taken just last year .
i didn &apos;t see him .
he told me , &quot; &quot; we appeal to you not to switch off the cameras .
they have been detached from their people , from the masses , and now we are seeing them collapsing one after the other .
( laughter ) but as you &apos;re thinking about narcissus , just don &apos;t fall in love with your own reflection .
now , the issue about tattoos is that , without a word , tattoos really do shout .
plugged me into the wires , put me to sleep , gave me the muscle relaxant .
by 18 and 19 , i was sleeping through the night .
and there is no way to be in this universe without mass .
but maybe a life has meaning only because it ends .
and the stories of heroism go well beyond just a kid getting a few extra chicken nuggets on their lunch tray .
and coast to coast , all of the lunch ladies told me the same thing : &quot; thank you for making a superhero in our likeness . &quot;
but both of these two embarrassing examples , i think , don &apos;t highlight what i think is most embarrassing about the mistakes that humans make , which is that we &apos;d like to think that the mistakes we make are really just the result of a couple bad apples or a couple really sort of fail blog-worthy decisions .
but of course , you know , the reason you &apos;re laughing is bad for humans too .
but trust , in the end , is distinctive because it &apos;s given by other people .
more trust is not an intelligent aim in this life .
you can see here in this time-lapse video that the sun , as it moves across the surface , as well as the shade , each of the tiles moves individually .
the influence — and if you have noticed , one of my spheres of influence is biology — is from a grasshopper .
we currently have 43 courses on the platform from four universities across a range of disciplines , and let me show you a little bit of an overview of what that looks like .
they &apos;re typing their program into the browser , and you can see they didn &apos;t get it quite right , lady liberty is still seasick .
don &apos;t worry .
the battle is won , but we still have to fight it .
it basically organizes itself . &quot; &quot; it organizes itself .
they &apos;re actually confident that they have liked congestion pricing all along .
these are the actual surgical screws used in reconstructing her ankle .
and this drive to not only teach but also to entertain resulted in some of the strangest anatomical illustrations .
do they allow for pollination , pollinator pathways that bees and butterflies and such can come back into our cities ?
our cities , i would put to you , are stockpiles of these surplus capacities .
and that source is design for generosity .
now i want to stipulate , as the lawyers say , that lolcats are the stupidest possible creative act .
how bad would you feel about taking a pencil from work home , compared to how bad would you feel about taking 10 cents from a petty cash box ?
we got a lot of people cheating by stealing by a little bit .
and there have been incidents reported in the press this year .
and 100,000 people , that &apos;s 10,000 more than can fit into wembley stadium , had turned out to watch .
we use this sound pedagogical model to encourage our students from all over the world to interact and study together and also to reduce the time our professors need to labor over class assignments .
meet wael .
but notice the violence that they fear is not the violence of genocide or the wars , it &apos;s everyday violence .
this is why , over time , i have come to call this epidemic of violence the locust effect .
video games give an awful lot of other things too , and that &apos;s why people get so addicted .
i wanted to update that video and give you a new look at it .
so i &apos;ll start with mobility .
it shows a cockroach moving over incredibly rough terrain without tipping over , and it &apos;s able to do this because its legs are a combination of rigid materials , which is what we traditionally use to make robots , and soft materials .
so we know she &apos;ll be successful . but we have to watch her .
and let me show you what happened .
also , those very sounds tend not to be represented by the characters that are available in european languages .
but there were problems .
but after the food goes through the digestive system , when it is thrown out as crap , it is no longer fashionable to speak about it .
open defecation is rampant .
you want to sleep lightly , wake up easily .
you want to have nightmares and flashbacks of the thing that could kill you .
first , within each video , the brat pack characters are used as a kind of template for performing the social reality of each group .
i want to share with you my latest hero , julian sanchez , a libertarian who works at the , for many people , &quot; &quot; evil &quot; &quot; cato institute .
put them all together , and put all this under kind of natural selection , under mutation , and rewarded things for how well they can move forward .
very soon they &apos;ll be doing everything for us .
other examples you can see here are from latvia , lithuania , estonia — the central european countries .
and that is really amazing .
all around her head was just swollen ; her head was about two sizes of its own size .
you see , we also have the technology .
entirely new requirement .
i &apos;ve got to use video teleconferences , i &apos;ve got to use chat , i &apos;ve got to use email , i &apos;ve got to use phone calls — i &apos;ve got to use everything i can , not just for communication , but for leadership .
in a city where this shouldn &apos;t happen because they have really mild weather that ranges from 20 to 25 degrees the whole year .
for this reason , i see even more importance to look at architecture finding simple but affordable solutions that enhance the relationship between the community and the environment and that aim to connect nature and people .
sangu delle : i think there is a role .
the political freedom for which our forebearers fought is meaningless without economic freedom .
let &apos;s crowdsource a magna carta for the web .
so here are some of the things which maybe threaten the social web we have .
in interior decorating , the pig &apos;s actually quite there .
and what was striking to me is that the farmers actually had no clue what was made of their pigs , but the consumers — as in us — had also no idea of the pigs being in all these products .
now , they have denied collaborating with the nsa .
( applause ) i mean , the new york times recently called for an amnesty for you .
and an important element that i really want you guys to understand is : this is not a timelapse , this is me photographing throughout the day and the night .
frankly , it was biblical .
and when i was 15 , a member of my local community approached my parents and wanted to nominate me for a community achievement award .
and that &apos;s when it dawned on me : this kid had only ever experienced disabled people as objects of inspiration .
that means they &apos;re totally out of sync in traditional classes , which are analog , static , interactively passive .
so the data on dropping out is amazing .
you can hear the five-year-old mind working .
investment has to be a different beast .
and it took about a week for us to actually gradually converge .
and i suppose i &apos;m a selfish environmentalist .
as you can see , there &apos;s me in my early , pre-marriage days with a brown beard , and little derek concentrating there .
( piano notes ) ao : i should really get derek &apos;s manager to come and play it .
and nike knows how to get your pace and distance from just that sensor .
the rest of it is the bedside console ; just for reference , this is a sleep tracking system from just a few years ago — i mean , really until now .
and since we know where their heads are , and we have a wireless mic on them that we &apos;re processing the sound from , we &apos;re able to create visualizations which are linked very tightly to what they &apos;re doing with their speech .
( laughter ) i &apos;m also a software engineer , and i make lots of different kinds of art with the computer .
and it &apos;s a company that &apos;s trying to bring the experience — many people have boats , or enjoy being on boats , but a very small percentage of people actually have the capability or the interest in going under the water and actually seeing what &apos;s there , and enjoying what scuba divers do .
and just the sales of the products — this is a non-profit — the sales of these products is now .6 % of the gdp of kenya .
you &apos;ve heard the impact of resource extraction , human noise and habitat destruction .
in a matter of seconds , a soundscape reveals much more information from many perspectives , from quantifiable data to cultural inspiration .
&quot; &quot; paradise is in this body .
as a documentary photographer , i felt the need to photograph each of his first movements like a mother with her newborn .
it has 30,000 children on those building sites .
this is where you &apos;ll find the fastest growing young populations of the world .
( laughter ) ( applause ) rsw : once a shit , always a shit !
richard koshalek : &#91; unclear &#93; starts from 2004 .
and we &apos;ve got something a little broader like big data with a truly global footprint reminiscent of a conversation that is happening everywhere .
and they &apos;re looking at energy technology and nuclear fusion .
being a fixer and a journalist is difficult and dangerous in gaza .
if anything should happen to the journalist , or if the journalist decides to cover a story the government doesn &apos;t want us to cover , bad things could happen .
how about two children or more ? right .
so in place of curiosity , what we have is a culture of compliance .
i still start every day practicing playing bach .
late at night , after hours of practicing , i would listen to janis joplin and billie holiday as the sounds of tango music would be creeping from my parents &apos; stereo .
if you &apos;re hoping to live to be 85 or older , your chance of getting alzheimer &apos;s will be almost one in two .
the lack of resources stems from a more fundamental cause : a lack of awareness .
by abolishing the army , we were able to turn military spending into social spending , and that was a driver of stability .
this is a very complex challenge , and i believe developing countries could take the lead in this transition .
they don &apos;t do it as much as they should , but they do it .
ordinary people are capable of understanding this information , if we only go to the effort of presenting it to them in a form that they can engage with .
but the over-eating and over-drinking , definitely .
there &apos;s trains and planes and cars and bill o &apos;reilly , he &apos;s very noisy .
some of you may even have some walking involved , because you &apos;re perusing grocery store shelves , or something like that .
i will be honest with you : i do not like the word &quot; &quot; impactful , &quot; &quot; but that is neither here nor there in terms of whether &quot; &quot; impactful &quot; &quot; is becoming common usage and becoming more acceptable in written prose .
this village was under a real threat of being wiped off the map when israel started building the separation barrier .
through inspired local leadership , they launched a nonviolent resistance campaign to stop that from happening .
so i looked at the countries whose students perform well academically , and looked at what they &apos;re doing to help their teachers improve .
i think it is a way to exemplify and illustrate things that we cannot convey in a lesson plan , things you cannot convey in a standard , things that you cannot even sometimes convey in a book of pedagogy .
instead of reaching out to the common or the collective wisdom in our societies , investing in it to find more creative solutions , we reverted to political posturing .
let &apos;s start from democracy .
so play is practical , and it &apos;s very important .
it &apos;s got to be serious if the new york times puts a cover story of their february 17th sunday magazine about play .
what maersk did is they worked ways to slow down .
it &apos;s as if the whole population had to shift from being basses to singing as a tenor .
what if you could make the genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate stroke ?
( applause )
you may have been dissatisfied with this talk , but fundamentally you have to go and read this stuff .
aging is ghastly , but it &apos;s inevitable , so , you know , we &apos;ve got to find some way to put it out of our minds , and it &apos;s rational to do anything that we might want to do , to do that .
i was a student in the &apos; 60s , a time of social upheaval and questioning , and — on a personal level — an awakening sense of idealism .
the war in vietnam was raging , the civil rights movement was under way and pictures had a powerful influence on me .
the thing is , though , most people aren &apos;t looking for and don &apos;t want to see these realities .
now , part of the art of practicing power means being awake and having a voice , but it also is about having an arena where you can plausibly practice deciding .
i make dictionaries .
so you can think of a word as like a hat .
now this brings me to a basic categorization in the way scientific discoveries are made .
they are instead the products of downstream imagination leading to hard work , during which mathematical reasoning may or may not prove to be relevant .
and when this was first built , there were protests in the local village .
new medical technologies like x-ray machines were invented .
but these are not the stories that the gymnosophist heard .
&quot; &quot; achilles was a man who could shape history , a man of destiny , and this is what you should be , alexander . &quot; &quot; that &apos;s what he heard .
are you annoyed that i didn &apos;t talk about gender equality or education ?
( applause )
so you have that same kind of spread of sports and civics and the arts and music , but it &apos;s represented in a very different way , and i think that maybe fits with our understanding of rio as being a very multicultural , musically diverse city .
let &apos;s take a look at san francisco .
it will happen .
we should be socializing them to make caregiving cool for guys .
now , i have three options that i would like to show you .
we shift the gravitational center of it .
so you completely print this part , and it can transform into something else .
we need a few simple ingredients .
thank you very much .
we have been playing guessing games with children all over the world .
but the system only works through the participation of rights owners .
the &quot; &quot; jk wedding &#91; entrance &#93; dance &quot; &quot; became so popular that nbc parodied it on the season finale of &quot; &quot; the office , &quot; &quot; which just goes to show , it &apos;s truly an ecosystem of culture .
and so carderplanet became a sort of supermarket for cybercriminals .
we are but the base of chaos .
and so everyone can be at least happy to see a shift from coal or oil to natural gas .
do we have a corner on the market ?
it &apos;s been something fulfilling to me .
and yes , toby is married and he does have a mortgage .
now , the other use of this is practical .
we know that what &apos;s going on between the bee and that flower is that bee has been cleverly manipulated by that flower .
like , everything i could think of , but not being a chemist .
here , this animation is zooming in onto our solar system .
we &apos;re transferring just a few little data bits when we &apos;re doing road controlling , road pricing .
i think this is a more powerful tool than the interstate highway act , and i think this is as important and world changing to our economy as electrification .
now , put them on both cups .
sj : oh !
it means , &quot; &quot; return and get it . &quot; &quot; learn from the past .
the creative spirit in africa , the creative tradition , is as potent as it has always been , if only designers could look within .
but their governments , needless to say , are relatively threatened by this .
that &apos;s why we heard about the backing away from the kyoto protocol , for example .
twenty-five percent of us are homebound or bedridden , and 75 to 85 percent of us can &apos;t even work part-time .
how could my doctor have gotten it so wrong ?
the film that changed my life is a 1951 film by vittorio de sica , &quot; &quot; miracle in milan . &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a remarkable comment on slums , poverty and aspiration .
and although the numbers were , and continue to be , extraordinary , what became more extraordinary was how the experience of critical and curious questioning translated into life .
but i want to start and go back to the 1930s .
there are thousands upon thousands of them .
and together with this new type of interfaces , we can use these technologies and apply them to safer cars for sighted people .
we just put a blind person in it and we &apos;re done , right ?
there are more neuromodulators that alter , that innervate this structure than actually neurons in the structure , and they &apos;re able to generate a complicated set of patterns .
( laughter ) and i think if you compare the natural history of flies and mice , it &apos;s really comparable . they have to forage for food .
lp : you know , i think the most important thing — i looked at lots of companies and why i thought they don &apos;t succeed over time .
it doesn &apos;t really understand you .
so the cell is the most basic unit of life .
so now every other piece of technology on the market can only manage a two- dimensional approximation of the extracellular matrix , which means that it doesn &apos;t fit in with the tissue itself .
they also invested in skill development , so that their employees would be able to resolve customer service problems on the spot .
take lego .
and the child was sent to a foster home for three days .
it may be a little surprising how many things there are , but it &apos;s not surprising what they are .
np : all right , pops , pops , pops , chill out , chill out .
hold up , hold up , hold up .
the adoption papers were signed , the child was given to the adoptive parents , and the mother shipped back to her community to say that she &apos;d been on a little break .
see , that &apos;s what family does .
when the contractors have gone bust , as they &apos;ve been overleveraged like everyone else , the difference is everything goes missing , documentation , passports , and tickets home for these workers .
1.1 million of them .
i think jason webley last night called it &quot; conspiring to be part of the magic . &quot;
instead , males used their fantastic antennae to sniff out perfumes given off by their females .
but there &apos;s so much more work to be done .
being a surrogate donor only requires you to say a few hundred to a few thousand utterances .
and then from hour to hour we rot and rot .
other people are going to say , &quot; &quot; this is great .
we &apos;ve just been waiting for all of you to want them .
it means that a stadium in brooklyn can be a stadium in brooklyn , not some red-brick historical pastiche of what we think a stadium ought to be .
but there are over 48 hours of video uploaded to youtube every minute .
because tastemakers like jimmy kimmel introduce us to new and interesting things and bring them to a larger audience .
you could see arguments on both sides .
is that an animal carcass behind her ? &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) you &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; you know ? i think that &apos;s an animal carcass behind her . &quot; &quot; and it &apos;s one after the other .
everything that &apos;s sent in eventually becomes part of the permanent archive of our government , our shared historical record .
alberto gonzalez : this is a special legal pad ?
adaptation &apos;s too important to be left to the experts .
while it &apos;s true that many who died in katrina did not have access to transportation , others who did refused to leave as the storm approached , often because available transportation and shelters refused to allow them to take their pets .
and , of course , i ’ m dedicating it also to my grandmother , whom i think really played quite a lot of important roles , especially for me when i was an activist , and being harassed by the police .
i &apos;ve got a bowl full of boiling water — the first one who comes in here , gets it . &quot; &quot; and they left .
so charter is a sort of parable for me , really .
so did my typeface .
even though i left when i was only three years old , i really felt that africa was this big part of my life .
it &apos;s not the fancy filmmaking where you say , oh , you want to put all the razzmatazz of hollywood , and where you have big budgets .
because when you go higher , the atmosphere is getting thinner , it &apos;s getting more unstable , the temperature is getting cooler , and you have a lot more u.v. radiation .
so to do that , it &apos;s easy .
so there &apos;s a pretty big gap there .
so if you compare the distance between these two , it &apos;s about 10 to the eighth , right ?
i said , &quot; &quot; what if i have somebody else pay for them ? &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) but who on earth would be interested by seven not-yet-built musical instruments inspired by women &apos;s bodies ?
and , you know , i woke up one morning with a pretty good idea .
so i come with my stencils , and i spray them on the suit , on the tank , and on the whole wall , and this is how it stands today until further notice . ( laughter ) now , i want to leave you with a final no .
now , speaking of walls , i want to share with you the story of one wall in cairo .
it meant : &quot; &quot; i commit myself . i engage myself . &quot; &quot; indeed , some of the world traditions think very little of religious orthodoxy .
i &apos;ve just come back from pakistan , where literally thousands of people came to my lectures , because they were yearning , first of all , to hear a friendly western voice .
and it sounded like me , it really did .
maybe i wasn &apos;t as smart , but i was at least as talkative .
( laughter ) the only question you might want to ask yourself is , could that be just mildly arrogant ?
but one question you might want to ask is , are we seeing a rapid evolution of the brain and of how we process data ?
or the garage doors that are brought from san diego in trucks to become the new skin of emergency housing in many of these slums surrounding the edges of tijuana .
i &apos;m talking simply about the creative intelligence of the bottom-up , whether manifested in the slums of tijuana that build themselves , in fact , with the waste of san diego , or the many migrant neighborhoods in southern california that have begun to be retrofitted with difference in the last decades .
so there are many other details like this .
let us have a hong kong nearby .
( laughter ) now , i think this is totally obvious , but the very obviousness of it raises what is for me an incredibly profound question .
why is it that as capitalism developed , it created a mode of production , of goods and services , in which all the nonmaterial satisfactions that might come from work were eliminated ?
we want to know how they looked like , how they behaved , how they walked around , and how they lived and grew up .
in a way , this was like the second birth for the child , after 3.3 million years , but the labor was very long .
they hugged .
who is going to allow a bunch of little girls , dressed up — &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) &quot; — to come inside a jail and dance with their daddies in spongebob suits ? &quot;
the first was that these animals continue to be hunted , killed with hakapiks at about eight , 15 days old .
i went down there in the winter time .
but when he died at the age of 94 , the police had to close down the streets of his neighborhood to accommodate the crowd of people who came out to mourn him .
books .
and women shouldn &apos;t have to spend four hours a day looking for it , or watching their kids die .
( applause )
i want to tell you two stories . both of them are in africa .
she moved to the united states , where she met my grandfather , who was a cement hauler , and they had nine children . three of them died as babies .
and india wants to be a knowledge society .
and he said , &quot; &quot; if my wish gets fulfilled &quot; &quot; — somebody was sick and he had to monitor — &quot; &quot; god , please cure him .
that &apos;s giving park managers a very first opportunity to use tactical management strategies that are more nuanced and don &apos;t lead to those extremes that i just showed you .
this is a small town in the amazon , imaged with the cao .
and that &apos;s this piece of metal i &apos;m going to be talking about in a minute .
so if a single atom can be in two different places at the same time , that chunk of metal can be in two different places , then why not you ?
so we did it . okay ?
( applause ) mission accomplished ! ( applause )
&quot; &quot; don &apos;t give us any of that self-actualization stuff .
you &apos;ll notice that the building is rather austere .
so i &apos;m not the first to figure this out . this is a quote from brian eno : &quot; the problem with computers is that there is not enough africa in them . &quot;
and i think you &apos;re going to be able to see , use that infusion , to come up with new things , because you &apos;re coming from a different perspective .
cholera was reported in haiti for the first time in over 50 years last october .
we call it the water canary .
nonviolent activists can neutralize the military by causing soldiers to defect .
it may be that we can improve nonviolent action to a point where it is increasingly used in place of war .
and finally , you want something that &apos;s species-specific .
so about 10 years of internal evaluation , testing , to get this to a state where we think it &apos;s actually ready .
we &apos;ve registered released animals mating in nature and having chicks .
and in these places they are cared for .
it renders off-limits all kinds of behavioral choices without our even knowing that it &apos;s happened .
but the most important reason is that a system of mass surveillance suppresses our own freedom in all sorts of ways .
and we see a blip up in the truckers &apos; purchases of fuel , and we know that a recession is about to end .
and in fact , if you could do that , what you would see is something like this .
dr : well here &apos;s the issue : we knew that this was not in the sense of — we think about the site , and think about the need for a memorial .
and kevin kennon , rick scofidio , liz diller and all the people within the city — norman lear , who i spoke to four hours before our deadline for funding , offered to give us a bridge loan to help us get through it .
now , i want to be clear here .
in 2002 , my colleagues and i published an article describing the pms and pmdd research , and several similar articles have appeared in psychology journals .
when politics becomes just a presidential election , we yell and we scream at our screens , and then we collapse , exhausted .
i can stand up and do something . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the joy of voting &quot; &quot; project isn &apos;t just about joy .
because what i see in them is myself — or what would have been myself .
they know that when it comes to schooling , black lives don &apos;t matter and they never have .
but it didn &apos;t work out . ( laughter ) i went to art school .
so this film is called &quot; &quot; clouds over sidra , &quot; &quot; and it was made in conjunction with our virtual reality company called vrse and the united nations , and a co-collaborator named gabo arora .
( applause ) thank you . i want you there . i want you there .
number four , a kinder world .
slapping thighs , shuffling feet and patting hands : this was how they got around the slave owners &apos; ban on drumming , improvising complex rhythms just like ancestors did with drums in haiti or in the yoruba communities of west africa .
why do we dance together ?
before that time , people are left to their own devices .
this actually became my creative obsession .
don &apos;t create solutions to impress customers .
this is a great solution for the african continent because 80 percent of africans don &apos;t have a bank account , but what is exciting is that m-pesa is now becoming the source of other disruptive business models in sectors like energy .
everyone is just a little bit mad .
and there &apos;s a book — john gartner .
and there is an emerging case that maybe that was what happened last july when the oil prices were so high .
and actually a lot of them are doing huge amounts of stuff .
you know , there &apos;s about 400 different parts of the brain which seem to have different functions .
and then notice that a great many of these problems disappear .
and then one day , my colleague walked into my office , and he said , &quot; &quot; dr. burke , have you seen this ? &quot; &quot; in his hand was a copy of a research study called the adverse childhood experiences study .
so the other thing that happens when you understand this science is that you want to shout it from the rooftops , because this isn &apos;t just an issue for kids in bayview .
but ...
this is a picture of members of the citizen media network , global voices , that i helped to cofound over 10 years ago with my friend , ethan zuckerman .
tim and his cofounders launched the company with two million dollars in funding .
so there are real life lessons we can learn from soap operas , and those lessons are as big and adventurous as any soap opera storyline .
we really struggle to do this .
i think that perhaps the emergence of the first cells was as probable as the emergence of the stars .
they have created extremely coherent structures that they use to show the inconsistencies in government policies .
the first one is that drug violence is actually the result of a huge market demand and an institutional setup that forces the servicing of this market to necessitate violence to guarantee delivery routes .
today , we &apos;re working with hundreds of activists filming undercover .
you can buy them off the shelf .
so i &apos;ll just describe a couple of things that we &apos;ve created .
and i &apos;m not a dj , and i &apos;m not a musician , so i &apos;m a little bit scared of that .
so , it &apos;s been an honor . thank you murray gell-mann .
and there are some brilliant linguists , mostly russians , who are working on that , at santa fe institute and in moscow , and i would love to see where that leads .
and i &apos;d write them back , and i &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; what a minute . we &apos;re not french .
most world leaders didn &apos;t take notice , and those that did thought this was just &quot; &quot; buddhist economics . &quot; &quot; but the king was serious .
the key is this : our visual systems are good at detecting blobs and edges , but they &apos;re really bad at what our world has become , which is screens with lots and lots of data .
just imagine an astronaut being able to feel the overall health of the international space station , or , for that matter , having you feel the invisible states of your own health , like your blood sugar and the state of your microbiome , or having 360-degree vision or seeing in infrared or ultraviolet .
i want to live in a world where my son will not be presumed guilty the moment he is born , where a toy in his hand isn &apos;t mistaken for anything other than a toy .
these events and all that has transpired after them have brought me back to my own childhood and the decisions that my parents made about raising a black boy in america that growing up , i didn &apos;t always understand in the way that i do now .
shrinking ice sheets make the planet darker , so it absorbs more sunlight and becomes warmer .
a warmer ocean releases co2 , just as a warm coca-cola does .
they &apos;ve included people like yassin aref .
prisoners were locked down in solitary for 22 hours a day .
and he still is holding this line .
and this is in takaungu — we &apos;ve got a generator and a digital projector , and we &apos;re projecting it up against a barn , and showing one of the movies that they made .
we got there first .
and there are industrial versions of this — about 20,000 dollars .
charles fain was convicted of kidnapping , rape and murder of a young girl walking to school .
and i worked with mehta vihar who creates virtual simulations for the army for tactical practice .
we have an immunity to all of the junk that lies around the edges of our culture .
now , am i saying that a sizable minority of the world &apos;s population has had their brain hijacked by parasitic ideas ?
one day soon after that — it was a friday — at the end of the day , i went down — i was going down to the subway . it was rush hour and thousands of people were streaming down the stairs .
well , i &apos;ve been thinking . for one thing , there &apos;s a new electronic tagging technology that allows any store to know the entire history of any item on the shelves in that store .
( video ) friend : ah !
my inspiration comes from problems in my daily life .
and now we know that there are hundreds of other sorts of cells , which can be very , very specific .
but there are also hallucinations as well , and hallucinations are completely different .
and this pressure forces the seawater through a membrane .
but this will produce an equally massive amount of desalination brine .
well , you &apos;re going to have your own personal matter fabricator .
and so you can make your molecule in the printer using this software .
( laughter ) and i &apos;m not going to argue with you . you &apos;re an astronaut , a hero , and i &apos;m from new jersey , so — ( laughter ) i &apos;m just going to show you some footage .
very dangerous , very impossible to do , and particularly on our stage , because there literally is no way to actually move this train , because it fits so snugly into our set .
mathematical models are used to continuously re-plan a cooperative strategy 50 times per second .
we relinquish control of yaw , but roll , pitch and acceleration can still be controlled with algorithms that exploit this new configuration .
the more democratic our societies have been , the more equal they have been becoming .
this is why basically you have all this creative mistrust between the representatives and those whom they represent .
who have you ever known who woke up in the morning — ( laughter ) — that turned black ?
compare the doctor in 1900 , who really had only a few tricks up his sleeve , with the modern general practitioner or specialist , with years of scientific training .
he &apos;s actually right about where i fell .
often what happens is you &apos;re planning so hard for like , &quot; how do i get through the hardest part ? how do i get through the hardest part ? &quot;
and if you look at the name of one of those streets , bread street , you can tell what was going on there 300 years ago .
and , in fact , if you look at the map of any city built before the industrial age , you can trace food coming in to it .
it evolved to soak up impurities . &quot; &quot; and then he added , &quot; but our water has no impurities . &quot;
it &apos;s that acrid , tar-like flavor .
as you can tell , you need to be a robot to fly this thing for thousands of hours .
i &apos;m not sure why there is a hole in this particular man .
the first thing is water .
but by thinking differently , and shipping these , people can stay put .
but — ca : tell me about what — i mean , i think you asked the board what you might say at ted , right ?
the content is not dinner table conversation in the least .
the building was finished in 1983 .
so it continued on for many years after he died .
so it &apos;s not all bad news . i mean , there definitely is progress on the line , but i think what we find is that the closer that we get right into the heart of power , the more opaque , closed it becomes .
you &apos;ve got to have skepticism and humility .
( laughter ) ak : a month later , we were there in london with this big box and a studio full of people about to work with us .
joey , come here .
it is the market for all those people for whom there is no other market coming .
and then we went out of business , suddenly and traumatically .
people aren &apos;t simply projecting identity , they &apos;re creating it .
there &apos;s a significant delta , in fact , between what we &apos;re willing to accept .
we &apos;ve got four plants . we &apos;re building this stuff around the country .
so then we went forward and built our production line in china .
these are not normally the most cheerful of topics , nor do they generally generate the kind of good news that this conference is about .
who ever could have imagined ian paisley and martin mcguinness jointly governing northern ireland as first and deputy first minister ?
live demos are hard , right ?
there are more and more of them .
we are more honest with search engines than we are with our families .
( laughter ) we are right now seeing a much larger scale of tracking of individual citizens than he could have ever imagined .
there are hair follicles on them , and i can paint my toenails .
( laughter ) it is . it &apos;s just stuck in this position , so i have to wear a two-inch heel .
i &apos;m a man who &apos;s trying to live from his heart , and so just before i get going , i wanted to tell you as a south african that one of the men who has inspired me most passed away a few hours ago .
now for as long as i can remember , my job has been to take people out into nature , and so i think it &apos;s a lovely twist of fate today to have the opportunity to bring some of my experiences out in nature in to this gathering .
in a g-zero world , the way you lead is by example .
surely , when the leaders are all onstage , then the americans are pulling their weight .
fortunately , we find millions of their remains strewn across the permafrost buried deep in siberia and alaska , and we can actually go up there and actually take them out .
and we used to imagine that someday , they would actually come to life and they would crawl out of the resin , and , if they could , they would fly away .
well , remember the philosopher &apos;s explanation of the lady ?
every one . i &apos;ll just show you by running it again .
it &apos;s also pretty quiet , but a bit noisier . ( louder whirring noise ) but most deep-diving rovs these days use hydraulics and they sound like the ventana . ( loud beeping noise ) i think that &apos;s got to be scaring a lot of animals away .
now , this pinwheel of light that the atolla produces is known as a bioluminescent burglar alarm and is a form of defense .
it &apos;s transparent to light , but in order for you to see it , we &apos;re going to make it white . ok ?
so that &apos;s where we are today , and that &apos;s what i wanted to give you a flavor of .
and finally , he had a breakthrough .
and for that , we owe him a great vote of thanks .
( applause )
already , we have been manufacturing with cell cultures for thousands of years , beginning with products like wine , beer and yogurt .
so i &apos;m going to show you now , without the skin on it , a 30-second piece , and then i &apos;m done .
we put this thing together .
why don &apos;t we vote for people in our government based on compassion , so that we can have a more caring world ?
i looked into the face of one of these women , and i saw in her face the strength that arises when natural compassion is really present .
i was born in britain , as you have probably guessed .
but my mother has lived by this creed all her life .
african farmers only use some 22 kilograms of fertilizer per hectare , compared to 144 in asia .
it seems very ambitious .
and how will we learn to deal with the truths of unfiltered human thought ?
next we need to increase the resolution another thousandfold to get a deeper glimpse .
all five of them turned and started walking back to the coast and all five died on that return journey .
the pithiest answer to the question &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; that &apos;s been dogging me for the last 12 years was credited certainly to this chap , the rakish-looking gentleman standing at the back , second from the left , george lee mallory . many of you will know his name .
it &apos;s not poverty , not racism , not exclusion that are new .
emotions ran deep . many wept .
thank you very much .
i don &apos;t think we are particularly materialistic .
so as a photographer , i wanted to explore what this problem really looks like .
in the long run , that &apos;s bad news , so researchers are working on finding alternatives to control these mites .
can you see bfib ?
finally , these invisible wounds don &apos;t just have a name , they have a face .
some even use a modern day spirometer that actually has a button labeled &quot; &quot; race &quot; &quot; so the machine adjusts the measurement for each patient according to his or her race .
today , doctors still uphold cartwright &apos;s claim the black people as a race have lower lung capacity than white people .
baby : yeah .
this has become my favorite way of videographing just about any space .
so one of the things you can do to our icons , just like paper , is crease them and fold them , just like paper . remember , you know , something for later .
i think beyond the icons , i think another really cool domain for this software — i think it applies to more than just icons and your desktop — but browsing photographs .
this one is of the amazing lee kuan yew .
take a look .
i don &apos;t think we quite won this war yet , and i don &apos;t think anyone here will question that .
and you &apos;ll also see that , for example , stomach cancer once used to be one of the biggest killers of all cancers , is essentially eliminated .
but it &apos;s not dinosaur dna .
snakes are occasionally born with legs .
ask yourself , who &apos;s responsible ? adults .
now , what &apos;s even worse than restriction , is that adults often underestimate kids &apos; abilities .
what happens here is that the brain activity that generated the movements in the monkey was transmitted to japan and made this robot walk while footage of this walking was sent back to duke , so that the monkey could see the legs of this robot walking in front of her .
so every trajectory that you see of the cursor now , this is the exact first moment she got that .
and as soon as you &apos;ve got that idea , you should immediately wonder : what happens if we widen the differences , or compress them , make the income differences bigger or smaller ?
thank you .
and you know , i think of all of these organisms as palimpsests .
the oldest living things in the world are a record and celebration of our past , a call to action in the present and a barometer of our future .
but we all actually have the same capacity that they do , and we need to do their work now .
because ubuntu work is slow , and it &apos;s difficult .
but in 2007 , two remarkable individuals , shinya yamanaka of japan and jamie thomson of the united states , made an astounding discovery .
i witnessed the technical difficulty .
these great ice islands break off — and now watch this .
i &apos;m certain that we can .
( applause )
so then we said , how many people were executed on march 29 , 1984 ?
but what &apos;s more amazing is what you can &apos;t see , because what we know now is that around every star or almost every star , there &apos;s a planet , or probably a few .
so this process is something that i study and it &apos;s called atmospheric escape .
and i didn &apos;t understand . he said , &quot; &quot; you have a great style .
i had this book that was how to draw comics in the marvel way , and it taught me how to draw superheroes , how to draw a woman , how to draw muscles just the way they were supposed to be if i were to ever draw for x-men or spiderman .
it was a lack of ice — open water .
( laughter ) .
they decide what is too offensive or too provocative for you to see .
it has rocked the music industry ; it has changed the way we consume music .
&quot; &quot; and we &apos;d like to go ahead and close this out .
secondly , make it clear from the beginning that either you have no money at all or that you would rather spend money with your attorney fighting the troll than actually giving them the money .
have a foreground , a background , all in beautiful proportion .
they work even when you sleep .
how do we mimic the way trust is built face-to-face online ?
this year , two billion dollars worth of loans will go through peer-to-peer lending platforms .
and actually , a growing number of science publishers are adopting this model .
we focus primarily on the planet &apos;s environment , but we also address issues of global development , international conflict , responsible use of emerging technologies , even the rise of the so-called second superpower and much , much more .
it &apos;s what i call social contagion , and it &apos;s really powerful and really exciting .
it was no big deal , but it was a latrine .
kay , now can you see anything ? ( girl : no . ) pull it so you can &apos;t even see down . ( girl : okay . ) woman : it &apos;s completely blind now , right ?
and you walk around , and it points to things .
the first group started in the study when they were sophomores at harvard college .
so what about you ?
and puzzling it is .
there &apos;s no passing time with you , only collecting — the collecting of moments with the hope for preservation and at the same time release .
our vision is local manufacturing , like the local food movement , for production .
and what they &apos;re doing in our equipment is going through a continuous system , which cleans , cooks , cools and pasteurizes these materials , while also continuously inoculating them with our mycelium .
dionysians don &apos;t do balance .
( applause ) and this is the last one .
the second thing that we did is that the quality of growth was not good enough .
but what did we do wrong ?
well , titus lost complete faith in the legal system , and yet he got an idea .
and we succeeded in planting this memory in the minds of about a quarter of our subjects .
it is said that the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence , and i believe this is true , especially when i hear president obama often talk about the korean education system as a benchmark of success .
no , better yet , a part of my mind has just been shot over to your mind .
the syllabus doesn &apos;t mention even the fact that we &apos;re naked , let alone look for a reason to it .
either they will go on for the next 40 years , 50 years , 60 years .
needless to say , i canceled all my meetings and i jumped on a plane to montgomery , alabama .
( laughter ) but there , i learned something different about buildings .
in the window of the hospital &apos;s tiny gift shop there was a sign that said , &quot; &quot; volunteers needed . &quot; &quot; hmm .
and i saw a sign .
and then think about what it also means for other decisions in your life , and hopefully also for policy questions that affect all of us .
and finally , we also have an action gap .
and he says , &quot; &quot; anything you notice ? &quot; &quot; no . then he sticks a needle into the pipe , and he connects this to a container , and he fills the container up with green ink . you with me ?
no , they &apos;re not the same . ( laughter ) they &apos;re not the same . the top one is 10 percent longer than the bottom one .
and this particular plant removes formaldehydes and other volatile chemicals .
with the help of iit , teri , and learnings from nasa , we discovered that there are three basic green plants , common green plants , with which we can grow all the fresh air we need indoors to keep us healthy .
when we used this groundbreaking eeg technology to actually look at justin &apos;s brain , the results were startling .
after justin was given anti-seizure medication , the change in him was amazing .
so i said we have such an industrial machine in the lab to heat up the specimens .
actually , it still has to cool down first before i can show you that the healing works .
( laughter ) the second question was an icelandic word .
and it actually means sad .
all these pictures were taken with a scanning electron microscope , actually in the lab at kew laboratories .
four very different habitats might look similar , but they &apos;ve got very different pollen signatures .
so i want to see how things work and what &apos;s happening .
&quot; chaos city . &quot;
listen .
be in that moment .
( laughter ) moderator : about your erotic fantasies . ia : with antonio banderas .
nobody else sees that . ( laughter ) i &apos;m invisible .
they could not tell you about the ink of their own love letters .
i was on the subway yesterday with this mail crate , which is a conversation starter , let me tell you .
it may be taken for granted in canada , in america , in many developed countries , but in poor countries , in patriarchal societies , in tribal societies , it &apos;s a big event for the life of girl .
it was a doomsday for my family and for me .
well , what you can see is that when people have to pay for their bed nets , the coverage rate really falls down a lot .
and i suspect many of you probably gave something towards that problem as well , but somehow it doesn &apos;t happen with the same intensity .
i have a tough job to do .
around these four are usually a group of about 16 children , who are also advising , usually wrongly , about everything that &apos;s going on on the computer .
so there isn &apos;t a big legacy in the pride of education .
thank you .
these were being sold for about 2,000 dollars each , and they are used for bear paw soup , and also being trained , later on , to become dancing bears like the one you just saw .
of course we also had to get the bears in .
you might apply that knowledge in a different field entirely , in a way that you couldn &apos;t have anticipated .
in fact , it does just the opposite , because when someone asks you what you want to be , you can &apos;t reply with 20 different things , though well-meaning adults will likely chuckle and be like , &quot; &quot; oh , how cute , but you can &apos;t be a violin maker and a psychologist .
if any child is found violating these rules , he is severely reprimanded .
they rely very heavily on teachers , who i have personally seen distort the message to these children as and when it suits their purpose to .
we have one body , not two , not three .
and one more wonder to celebrate is the fact that we have imaging technologies that now allow us to go inside the human brain and be able to do , for example , what you &apos;re seeing right now .
but it will not be a cheap , shallow redemption that comes through blather about us all being in it together .
we can choose ways of relating that get us out .
and show the video .
they don &apos;t stick by velcro or suction or glue .
everyone here must own one , or at least they craved one the moment they saw one .
they &apos;ve made a selection .
( laughter ) and yogi berra used to say , of course , that it &apos;s very tough to make predictions , especially about the future . ( laughter )
and that &apos;s all of us .
see , back in the 1880s , 1890s , many scientists , many observers , looked at the light given off from atoms .
it looks like a moon , but in fact , it &apos;s a picture of earth .
fuzziness overlaps .
you cannot say , &quot; &quot; is it you ? &quot; &quot; too late !
you can increase the shadow of the future .
you need to reward those who cooperate and blame those who don &apos;t cooperate .
and the most biofuel we might need , just three million barrels a day , can be made two-thirds from waste without displacing any cropland and without harming soil or climate .
so how else could we replace the coal-fired power plants ?
no virtuous act is quite as virtuous from the standpoint of our friend or foe as from our own standpoint .
adam ii is the humble side of our nature .
they don &apos;t make anyone safer .
what about people with disabilities or who need assistance in there ?
and i think that &apos;s really the truth . we still don &apos;t understand how these very simple instructions can lead to increasing complexity .
&quot; if it &apos;s that easy to create living organisms , why not create a few yourself ? &quot;
( applause ) however , gaddafi left behind a heavy burden , a legacy of tyranny , corruption and seeds of diversions .
our society , shaped by a revolutionary mindset , became more polarized and has driven away from the ideals and the principles — freedom , dignity , social justice — that we first held .
i &apos;ll just swim right through them .
and to get the government permissions , you read in the paper , you think it &apos;s easy to get into cuba everyday ?
if everybody on the planet lived the way we did , we &apos;d need between five , six , seven , some people even say 10 planets to make it .
but it &apos;s happening all over the place , and these tools are part of what &apos;s making it possible .
chapter 17 is an exploration of the absence of a bloodline and the absence of a history .
during the time i was in bosnia , the mortal remains of zumra &apos;s eldest son were exhumed from a mass grave .
coral reef in new caledonia .
i sent around the world six cameramen asking the same question , the same crucial question , about life .
shoots seem tiny , but to reach the sun they can break through brick walls .
so this opens up a whole new avenue of research .
in terms of transport infrastructure , what really makes a difference between advanced and backward cities is not highways or subways but quality sidewalks .
there is a conflict for space between those with cars and those without them .
gg : i want to make the world a better place .
mk : well , it just gets the conversation going .
i was asked , i guess about six years ago , to do a series of paintings that in some way would celebrate the birth of piero della francesca .
that poster is not folded .
( laughter ) they are .
wait for the man with the mockingbird . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) yeah . and then come the news crews , and the man-in-the-street interviews , and the letters to the editor .
witness the fact that it &apos;s here on this garmin device being used by rescue team in haiti .
you can see europe is ablaze with updates .
my deepest truth allowed me to accept who i am .
here is mine .
and god was out of the picture .
and it &apos;s , it &apos;s a kind of — you know , charles i got beheaded somewhere early in the 17th century .
some formations are almost at the threshold of human visibility .
but that &apos;s only half of the story — 99.9 percent of the folding ratios produce not this , but this , the geometric equivalent of noise .
i am buckling in seatbelts from the front .
&quot; oh , my god . &quot; i said , &quot; ok , fine . does pop know you &apos;re driving ? &quot;
biological — there &apos;s autoimmune diseases , where the body attacks itself a little too overzealously and destroys the host , or the person .
it &apos;s kind of cool . songwriters can sort of get away with murder .
i was a teenager , and at 15 or 16 , i guess like all teenagers , we want to just do what we love and what we believe in .
in nigeria , people carry their most precious belongings on their heads .
co-evolution entwined insects and birds and plants forever .
a breath that &apos;s fossilized now as iron .
( applause )
i sent nick off . nick came back .
( laughter ) and they &apos;re really interested in how over-coddled we &apos;ve become .
so for example , in realist paintings , it ranges from this , which is kind of old masters style , to really realistic still-life , to this type of painting where i &apos;m painting with a single hair .
so i think practicality is one case where it &apos;s worth teaching people by hand .
programming is how most procedures and processes get written down these days , and it &apos;s also a great way to engage students much more and to check they really understand .
and only one contrary data point can blow your theory out of the water .
think about the group of moms who are talking about their wonderful children in a focus group , and almost none of them buy lots of junk food .
the black dot is the average of all these brains working in parallel , in real time .
and this is what we wanted to show during the world cup , and couldn &apos;t , because for some mysterious reason , fifa cut its broadcast in half .
and so we &apos;re bringing them back in a contemporary story for children .
now we do the same with airplanes .
that changed everything . from then on , you could not get these engineers back in the boat .
obviously , life can teach us something in the entertainment section . life has a lot to teach us .
a button , two guitar picks and lots of hot glue .
the heads-up display is a smartphone that displays system parameters .
the only story that matters is the one that you want to write .
and you may feel so very alone , but you are not .
at the end of the season , you actually don &apos;t want it to rain , because rains then can damage the crop .
it &apos;s a very different value proposition .
so they felt worse .
but there are , of course , pitfalls , and it would be really foolish of us to ignore them .
i got my name just because i was so young .
i mean , this is literally human beings with super-human strength and abilities .
dozens of projects give us an inkling of what they &apos;re capable of doing .
here in the united states , where we have healthcare reform , we don &apos;t have the professionals we need .
in fact , many people told us it was illegal .
neighbors came and went . under president adams , a local dentist happened by .
but when i was told that the topic was language , i felt that i had to speak about something for a moment .
as you can probably gather , s &apos;s and t &apos;s , together or independently , are my kryptonite .
the most important thing to know about prehistoric humans is that they were unimportant .
but over the centuries , we have constructed on top of this objective reality a second layer of fictional reality , a reality made of fictional entities , like nations , like gods , like money , like corporations .
not a complicated thing .
we believe that you should always understand the risks that you &apos;re taking , and we will not invest in things we don &apos;t understand .
are we safer today ?
it mutates furiously , it has decoys to evade the immune system , it attacks the very cells that are trying to fight it and it quickly hides itself in your genome .
i spent my summers in a war zone , because my parents were afraid that if we didn &apos;t go back to palestine every single summer , we &apos;d grow up to be madonna .
( cheering ) not good enough .
they &apos;ve been doing it for hundreds of millions of years .
and the people in chicago made a reef of their own .
i &apos;m doing weight-bearing exercise , so that i have the muscle strength so that when i start to wither , i have more time that i can still move around .
they say that people who are engaged in activities are happier , easier for their caregivers to look after , and it may even slow the progress of the disease .
they have bad ideas .
the more output you churn out , the more variety you get and the better your chances of stumbling on something truly original .
governor schwarzenegger and his wife maria stopped by to discuss the display .
we did hundreds of necropsies , and over a third had polluted plastic fragments in their stomachs .
this is called the eyewriter , and you can see the description .
so the awards were like , &quot; &quot; oh , this is fantastic . &quot; &quot; armstrong twittered about us , and then in december , time magazine honored us as one of the top 50 inventions of 2010 , which was really cool .
more animals , if they start doing searches as well .
in the u.s. and spain , it was popular at the same time .
and of of the criticisms is this idea of merit .
bias can be about race , it can be about gender .
now , on the video , on the video here , i &apos;m going to show you exactly the same thing , except that what i &apos;m showing you on the video happened one hour after i took the tablet .
they had a very strong preference for biting on the face .
and i &apos;d hit that glass ceiling too often , and i wanted opportunities for women .
philanthropy is all that i do now .
or , you could say that the individual &apos;s preferences were shaped by the preferences of specific others .
it &apos;s a great story , and it &apos;s understandable why they would be reluctant to revise it .
as always , i would return to bangalore , and often to animated discussions at friend &apos;s homes , where we would discuss various issues while they complained bitterly about the new pub timings , where a drink often cost more than what they &apos;d paid their 14-year-old maid .
during this expedition i expected him to be killed outright , and us as well .
can you see that ?
and you come together to realize that we &apos;re all in this together , that this delusion of difference — this idea of countries , of borders , of religion — doesn &apos;t work .
now i was growing up in the late &apos; 60s and early &apos; 70s , and there were a number of other passions i was also interested in , but these two were the ones that differentiated me .
that then set me off completely to say , okay , these two are connected .
yr : it was down on the bottom .
i don &apos;t do special physical training .
we can see trees even mapping systems of law , the various decrees and rulings of kings and rulers .
and what they did here is , they actually segmented the network into three different years , represented by the vertical layers that you see behind me .
so this is &quot; &quot; oblivion &quot; &quot; by astor piazzolla .
thank you so much .
it &apos;s considering the implications of what this generation has to say to the rest of us .
my interest is in artists who understand and rewrite history , who think about themselves within the narrative of the larger world of art , but who have created new places for us to see and understand .
it &apos;s like a wireless accelerometer , pedometer .
what we have is , in a way , a perfect positive storm .
far from it .
let &apos;s not sugarcoat it .
rm : it &apos;s adaptable and remixable .
105 entries were received .
raven shed his feathers , bear his fur , and salmon her scales , and then , they would dance .
when they arrived , they would all take off their skins .
i couldn &apos;t go out and play basketball at recess without feeling like i was going to pass out when i got back inside .
thank you .
many of these life-forms live in unusual ways .
what can they teach us about evolution and survival ?
as you can see here on this graph , in blue , these are all other mammals , but bats can live up to nine times longer than expected despite having a really , really high metabolic rate , and the question is , how can they do that ?
this is considered the five blessings .
sp : we made the news .
i feel exploited and proud at the same time .
however , the work itself resisted the very nature of a retrospective , and this is just some of the stuff that was in the show .
it &apos;s a kind of invention of the museum that &apos;s supposed to bring a kind of cohesive understanding to the public of a body of work .
but no commercial source .
they carry hundreds of tons for hundreds of years in cold weather , in warm climates , uv light .
i mean , i showed you a computer model , but a computer is not understanding .
but there is a countervailing force in the universe — the tendency towards spontaneous order . and so that &apos;s our theme .
i &apos;m coming out .
and i don &apos;t mean he made lego that looked like a slot machine ; i mean he made a slot machine out of lego .
we wanted to show them that the whole world was on their side , as they were going through this deeply personal experience .
coming of age on the beaches of southern california , i grew up in the middle of our nation &apos;s abortion wars .
when we were naming the site in cancun , we named it a museum for a very important and simple reason : museums are places of preservation , of conservation and of education .
gorgonian fans oscillate with the waves .
when we are ill , we want to heal fast .
this percentage is called the threshold .
so , we used the same bladder-inflated system , and we took it for testing .
so we may have developed the technology which is very efficient for pulling something long and heavy , but the idea is , what is the purpose of technology if it doesn &apos;t reach the right hands ?
( music ) ( video ) jonathan haidt : we humans have many varieties of religious experience , as william james explained .
look at the people in these photos i &apos;ve been showing you .
that makes people nervous .
this is the single most exciting adventure human beings have been on .
so , one question i often get after this talk — so i figured i &apos;d answer it now — is , well , what happens to the animal ?
and we went back to those high-speed videos again , and we could actually visualize the saddle compressing and extending .
( inaudible echoing voice ) not so good , is it ?
it &apos;s about designing , not appearance , but experience , so that we have spaces that sound as good as they look , that are fit for purpose , that improve our quality of life , our health and well being , our social behavior and our productivity .
mt : we anthropomorphize our machines .
i became operational at ted in march 2014 .
in the military , everything has meaning .
and i hear his footsteps .
we can collect more data .
that makes three of us .
let &apos;s say option a : $ 24,000 for this car and a five-year warranty .
we get dismissed or demeaned or even ostracized .
language evolved to solve the crisis of visual theft .
if you look at our ancestors , the neanderthals and the homo erectus , our immediate ancestors , they &apos;re confined to small regions of the world .
the biggest surprise for me of living in a community like this ?
only you can know .
when it asked people to rate it on terms of the quality of the working alliance , people rated the robot higher and they trusted the robot more .
and because it &apos;s new , leo doesn &apos;t really know what to make of it .
he came at 9 a.m. , and he didn &apos;t get a note from his teacher , because the teacher had watched the program .
and back and forth .
we intuit other people &apos;s feelings ; we know the meaning of their actions even before they happen .
well , they orient to the caregiver .
and i always felt that if my patient gave up the quest for the magic doctor , the magic treatment and began with me on a course towards wellness , it was because i had earned the right to tell them these things by virtue of the examination .
and as i wondered what he was up to , his stick fingers made their way up to his pajama shirt , fumbling with his buttons .
and at least in the united states , though not necessarily in other countries , we have closed our sanitoriums and probably most of you are not too worried about tb .
so we could have stopped there .
or they go , &quot; &quot; sit , sit , sit . &quot; &quot; they &apos;re making a hand signal in front of the dog &apos;s rectum for some reason , like the dog has a third eye there — it &apos;s insane .
and i can imagine this dog , you know , speaking through the fence to , say , an akita , saying , &quot; &quot; wow , my owners , they are so incredibly easy to train .
let me introduce him .
these are mine , i was born an argentinean .
no one wants it .
we &apos;ve got what &apos;s rational for public health .
and that &apos;s north korea up along the hill .
so , the second night , we didn &apos;t keep the kids &apos; room , because we went down and slept on the floor with all the kids at the orphanage .
we hope that all of you will come to see the allosphere .
inspire us to think of new ways that we can use this unique instrument that we &apos;ve created at santa barbara .
something big is going on in war today , and maybe even the history of humanity itself . the u.s. military went into iraq with a handful of drones in the air .
perhaps the best sign of how valuable they are to the war effort , is that the iraqi insurgents put a $ 50,000 bounty on the head of a single eod soldier .
what you get out of that is not smiley-ness .
how do they differ from the rest of us ?
we are not here to question the possible ; we are here to challenge the impossible .
comic books . quantum physics video games .
how does this work ?
strangely enough , i always get the same three answers .
this was incredible ; this is what i wanted to do .
and have to do something with it . &quot; &quot; hundreds of remixes came back — lots of different attempts .
but given a choice , i would rather have the warrior hearts of wangari maathai , somaly mam , jenny and rose mapendo .
by the way , 80 percent of all refugees and displaced people in the world are women and girls .
in the theater , the knife is not a knife and the blood is just ketchup .
and as every relationship comes to an end , ours went too .
find those people .
as soon as the question , &quot; &quot; why me ? &quot; &quot; came , the answer came just as quickly : why me ? because i &apos;m the one who can &apos;t sleep at night thinking about it .
so you have an image , a retina , and a brain .
the problem is that current prosthetics don &apos;t work very well . they &apos;re still very limited in the vision that they can provide .
these are the four ways to go .
the big growth industry are these .
they &apos;re tasty , and they make your pee smell funny .
we then started preparing them .
and two things happened in kosovo , which kind of , again , shows the randomness of life , because these things turned out to be two of the pivots of my life and helped to deliver me to the next stage .
i loved watching planes barrel over our holiday home in the countryside .
i got myself to the side of the lake .
but i learned two very , very important lessons there on mt . everest , and i thank my team of sherpas who taught me this .
that is a very difficult question to answer .
he &apos;s smart , he &apos;s smart .
i had a kid one day come into my class having been stabbed the night before .
she has an issue with authority .
something happened along the line .
you know , i may appear to be a very nice , clean , sweet boy .
so the whole point of that is not , sort of , to make , like , a circus thing of showing exceptional beings who can jump , or whatever .
flying monks .
and no two people could disagree about what the word free was and what the word falafel was , behind us , &quot; &quot; free falafel . &quot; &quot; you know .
it &apos;s 3d cgi , which is going to be very high-quality , written in hollywood by the writers behind ben 10 and spiderman and star wars : clone wars .
but if we zoom in and take the perspective of , say , a little ant walking around — little ants are so small that they can access all of the dimensions — the long dimension , but also this clockwise , counter-clockwise direction .
and let me show you what it is that he found .
so universal access to all knowledge — i think it can be one of the greatest achievements of humankind , like the man on the moon , or the gutenberg bible , or the library of alexandria .
this is what it looks like at the university of toronto .
so what we found by running all of these 5,000 passwords we collected through these tests to see how strong they were , we found that the long passwords were actually pretty strong , and the complex passwords were pretty strong too .
now , when they implemented this new policy , a lot of people , my colleagues and friends , came up to me and they said , &quot; &quot; wow , now that &apos;s really unusable .
now damien knows all about condoms , but he doesn &apos;t sell them .
they like the generics .
they &apos;re fighting battles over much narrower issues .
but he told me that after 9 / 11 , he began to have second thoughts .
the police , investigating officers , were amazingly efficient .
that &apos;s the shooter i saw that killed the father . &quot; &quot; that was all a preliminary hearing judge had to listen to , to bind mr. carrillo over to stand trial for a first-degree murder .
we have 14 to go , and we &apos;re increasing our capability of simulating those at about one extra order of magnitude every decade .
so what does a climate model look like ?
and our teacher told us that the industrialized world , 1960 , had one billion people .
but it &apos;s a very important role .
but , one of the problems with planting trees is that the people in these regions are so poor that they chop them down for firewood .
it seriously threatens the livelihoods of millions of people , and especially in africa and china .
for this , the stasi owned 17 remand prisons , one in every district .
fortunately , they had been stopped by human rights activists .
it was supposed to be our strength , wasn &apos;t it ?
let &apos;s look at the next answer here : women in school .
here &apos;s why : evolution always wins .
other bacteria , to protect themselves , evolve defenses against that chemical attack .
and here &apos;s the problem : the internet gave us access to everything ; but it also gave everything access to us .
it was lovely .
this is on a mercator projection .
we went in underneath and tapped it , and we found that it had the ph of drano .
do you want that ?
well , within a year this thing had taken off .
loan sharks are always an option , but with interest rates that are well above 300 percent , they &apos;re financially risky .
she would thank them , and ask them about their families and their health .
how do you explain drawings and engineering to people who are neither able to read nor write ?
in this place i sat in a class like that with more than 150 other kids , and for six years .
i was sure of it .
what do you think of foie gras that 99.99999 percent of the world eats ?
it &apos;s on . just turned it on .
so we &apos;ve placed electrodes within this circuit in an area of the brain called the fornix , which is the highway in and out of this memory circuit , with the idea to see if we can turn on this memory circuit , and whether that can , in turn , help these patients with alzheimer &apos;s disease .
the rest were outside at a new memorial .
it &apos;s time we strike a new note .
( music ) thank you . thank you .
the second string is a melody string , which is played with a wooden keyboard tuned like a piano .
why is it important now ?
they were startling , compelling and credible .
the whole tree was a fruit .
we then created holes , or apertures , that would lock in the rays of light and heat , distributing those silkworms on the structure .
hey , yeah !
isadora duncan — ( music ) — crazy , long-legged woman from san francisco , got tired of this country , and she wanted to get out .
so into the world now .
two percent of the american population is involved in farming .
like saddam , like mugabe , like kim jong-il — people who kill in hundreds of thousands or millions .
that plus nukes rules out great power war .
so bees have social healthcare .
and it &apos;s not just our honeybees .
because we want 30 million years worth of fusion power for the earth .
this is a bit shocking , because in fact our government is relying on that for us to meet kyoto , and do all those kind of things .
and in order to understand how serotonin works , it &apos;s critical to understand where the serontonin machinery is .
and some things look very familiar today .
and it &apos;s not just up to the cheryl barbaras and the donna martins of the world .
( laughter ) and coach parker , he credited that championship to donna martin .
and look at the amazing change in this one , where that gully has completely healed using nothing but livestock mimicking nature , and once more , we have the third generation of that family on that land with their flag still flying .
ca : that is an astonishing talk , truly an astonishing talk , and i think you heard that we all are cheering you on your way .
she asked , &quot; &quot; what &apos;s your chief complaint ? &quot; &quot; &quot; headache . &quot;
it comes from our personal investment in knowing that our lives matter , the context of where we live and where we work , eat , and sleep , matter , and that what we do for ourselves , we also should do for those whose living and working conditions again , can be hard , if not harsh .
we are the people that actually build our world , there are no artificial intelligences ...
and we &apos;re surrounded by natural light and organic elements .
here &apos;s some others .
i became an artist . o.k. , and started drawing .
that is , that it is one single , powerful , deterministic gene that causes the autism .
as we did this , though , it was really quite humbling , because we realized that there was not simply one gene for autism .
it &apos;s my gospel , when i &apos;m telling people , grow your own food .
and i &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; come on , really ?
see , we used to have a lot of apples .
but there are 35 to 40,000 different varieties of beans .
so i first went to copenhagen because i thought , well , maybe i could become a biochemist , but i discovered biochemistry was very boring .
and we thought we &apos;d probably have to look at several hundred before we got the picture . but as you can see , there &apos;s seven out of 20 had a change which was very high .
you know , there &apos;s 30-year cycles .
so i took a job at the united nations world food programme as a way to try to address these security issues through food security issues .
but western australia is not alone in this .
so biologically , there are plenty of species that display banding or patterns , warning patterns , to either be cryptical in the water or warn against being attacked , not the least of which is the pilot fish which spends a big slab of its life around the business end of a shark .
he quit a job at prestigious bell laboratory inventing new microscopes for biology because he thought scientists were taking his brilliant inventions and doing lousy work with them .
for this work , last year , eric betzig won the nobel prize .
when animals are going to make a point , they make the point .
( applause )
but some verbs are irregular .
so you just add &quot; &quot; ed &quot; &quot; to a verb at the end to signify the past .
and i , myself , have been very excited about it .
we were there with mit and uc berkeley engineers .
and similarly , she finds prototyping boards really frustrating for her little hands .
it turns out that regular play-doh that you buy at the store conducts electricity , and high school physics teachers have used that for years .
i &apos;d never really memorialized myself .
some people reacted in terror . ( laughter ) others reacted in asking you for help , and some people hide from you .
so with this tool , this boundary has been broken .
i started to imagine what this would look like .
and the lagoon was surrounded by palm trees , as you can see , and a few mangrove .
but the point is , we still come to galapagos .
first , it enables you to experience the universe : the worldwide telescope , for me , is a kind of magic carpet that lets you navigate through the universe where you want to go .
we see black holes at the heart of our galaxy , in the milky way , and elsewhere in the universe , where time itself seems to stand still .
why does it cost so much energy , then ?
gorillas can be two to three times larger than we are , so their brains should also be larger than ours , but instead it &apos;s the other way around .
so if we ever really want to understand the biological basis of psychiatric disorders , we need to pinpoint these locations in the brain where these chemicals act .
because the kids can &apos;t learn , they look for other things to distract their attention .
they &apos;re all playing pretty , somewhat minimal music here .
next , i &apos;m going to replace this 220 by math.random2f.
so it &apos;s not just google and facebook either .
and this was the big story of the day at that time .
the respect is stepping forward , not stepping backward , and i really think that by engaging your body in the moment , in the ceremony , in the places , people welcome you and understand your energy .
alone , actually , but just with local people , meeting my team , which was absolutely not professional people , on the spot there , going from one place to another and to make cinema as a trek .
and i got to tell you , if you haven &apos;t heard high-definition surround , go down to your audio dealer , your audiophile dealer .
and i &apos;ve got to tell you , we have this lab where we build and measure everything , back in raleigh , north carolina , and we flew out to los angeles .
that , by the way , in case you &apos;re paying attention , is not emotionally correct .
now , i think sean hannity is 99 percent politically wrong , but his emotional correctness is strikingly impressive , and that &apos;s why people listen to him .
when we have extreme el nino events , you see all this red , and you see no green out here around the galapagos .
you have to train to be able to do that .
there was a eugenics rising , and my grandparents realized , pretty quickly i think , that they were on the wrong side of the eugenics equation .
it &apos;s really that simple .
almost half of our greenhouse gases are related to the building industry , and if we look at energy , it &apos;s the same story .
and i feel that way because three billion people in the world today , over the next 20 years , will need a new home .
whenever i get to travel for work , i try to find out where my drinking water comes from , and where my poop and pee go .
this was the first permit of its kind in oregon .
they were spontaneously mimicking our vocalizations and our postures , and they were also inviting us into dolphin games .
so i try to give her the scarf .
and by the way , when i graduated from mit , i thought the worst and silliest thing to do would be to go to paris for six years . ( laughter ) so , i didn &apos;t do that . but design matters for a number of reasons .
and so , we have to drop in satellite dishes . we put in generators .
and it made me think , what happens when computers are now better at knowing and remembering stuff than we are ?
quite probably not .
you also know that we can &apos;t just keep doing what we &apos;ve always done , because we &apos;ll get the results we &apos;ve always gotten .
why did he do all this ?
we &apos;ve flown the cassini spacecraft by this moon now several times , flying closer and deeper into these jets , into the denser regions of these jets , so that now we have come away with some very precise compositional measurements .
( applause )
they &apos;ve tried many different approaches .
it &apos;s really debilitating , and there aren &apos;t really many good treatments for it .
but why does the earth go around the sun ?
so people tried to escape only to find that some of the fire doors had been chained shut .
and the irony of this particular system is the place where he did the research , which was mexico , didn &apos;t adopt this technology , ignored this technology , talked about why this technology should be thought about , but not really applied .
what is bioenergy ? bioenergy is not ethanol .
is the grand canyon awesome ?
you can &apos;t even buy a freaking t-shirt for that now .
yeah .
i would love to see google maps inside some of these caves .
these laws respect universal human rights and they are grounded in evidence .
the first is nick rhoades . he &apos;s an american .
however , inside a superconductor there are no collisions , so there is no energy dissipation .
and when i place the superconducting disk on top of this rail , it moves freely .
every night i fall asleep very well , and i am , i repeat , the happiest man in the world , and i &apos;m thankful i am alive .
we &apos;ve applied tumor treating fields to over 20 different cancers in the lab , and we see this effect in all of them .
but herein lies the problem .
where is that place for you where people who are affected by a unique problem can meet a unique solution ?
light enters , hits the back of the retina , and is circulated , most of which is streamed to the very back of the brain , at the primary visual cortex .
what we literally do is have the teams draw out the entire strategic plan on one giant wall .
it was so violent that it triggered several giant waves — they are called tsunami — and those tsunami destroyed many cities on the eastern coast of japan .
and it doesn &apos;t take too long before my students walk on a beach and stumble upon piles of trash .
are you sure that &apos;s what it was ?
it &apos;s more than an economic pursuit .
let &apos;s take the example of the heart , the topic of a lot of my research .
and let me tell you what it &apos;s like to grow these cells in the lab .
microscopy for 1,800 patients .
you name it , i bred it , and i sold them to pet shops .
it &apos;s the largest emotion database in the world .
try it everybody . let &apos;s get some smiles going on .
this has been the finding of medical anthropologists again and again .
it was the brainchild of the u.s. state department .
and that directly connects to ideas of city-making .
if you look at most buildings , what you look at is the building , the facade , and it is the building .
you have to hire them to spend a lot of time .
it would take millions . but of course , what i &apos;m describing is p2p file sharing .
it could be a stock trade .
ok . i want you to close your eyes .
so life might be insignificant in size , but it is not insignificant in time .
this pixel is the earth .
we need to stop shouting and start talking .
so that &apos;s some supply-side options .
it really does look like mars in certain locations and has been used by nasa to test equipment .
and it &apos;s really helpful , and it works really well , so that &apos;s really the important part of what we &apos;re doing .
now is the time to create change in this industry and to push it into a sustainable direction .
but now this : demand is going to go up .
( applause ) not one &apos;s parents &apos; actions on one &apos;s behalf , but when one &apos;s own actions lead to outcomes .
i mean , show the colleges you care about others .
and to me , that &apos;s the most important thing because , ever since being a kid , i &apos;ve wanted to communicate my passion and love .
i fell in love with the way things moved , so i started to explore motion by making little flipbooks .
we need sustainable harmony . i love this term .
so some philosophers thought we were irredeemably selfish .
and i &apos;d like to share a 45 year-old love story with the poor , living on less than one dollar a day .
&quot; you didn &apos;t get a government job ? &quot; i said , &quot; no . &quot;
by using this method , the first eight radicals will allow you to build 32 .
a door . put a plank inside the door , it &apos;s a door bolt .
why ?
and many of my beliefs actually turned out to be myths .
and the country never knew this . they never had any data from this area .
secondly , i &apos;d like you to create principles that will transcend my own presidency .
when i had learned this phrase , i had an artist over there hear me out to see how accurate it sounded .
but i am going to stick with it , because contrary to what we might usually assume , imitating somebody can reveal something unique .
and there are a number of possibilities , such as increasing circles of reciprocity in the sense that robert wright argues for .
here is a graph that he put together showing the percentage of male deaths due to warfare in a number of foraging , or hunting and gathering societies .
personal greatness .
in order to move up in organizations , you have to be known for your leadership skills , and this would apply to any of you , women or men .
then again , when do we ever know where love &apos;s first flutter will truly take us .
my research shows that in some instances , these blobs form much closer to the black hole than we initially thought .
but something struck me about the media attention that this letter was attracting .
we will continue to come together , like an army , when any member of our community is threatened .
i wrote this poem after hearing a pretty well known actress tell a very well known interviewer on television , &quot; &quot; i &apos;m really getting into the internet lately .
i wouldn &apos;t need it .
they blew up city streets and relocated monuments .
syria was largely a place of tolerance , historically accustomed to variety , accommodating a wide range of beliefs , origins , customs , goods , food .
and i always feel rather smug then .
it &apos;s true in congress , and it &apos;s certainly true in the british parliament .
you get a couple hundred kids each picking up five pieces , and pretty soon , you &apos;ve got a much cleaner camp .
the city called me and asked if our technology could help .
what they have sweated so far has no meaning .
it is helpless .
it goes to 1953 when american cia exercised a coup and removed a democratically elected leader , dr. mossadegh .
our people depend on our artists , and culture is beyond communication .
but there is a number that is greater than this that &apos;s going to bring this room down .
is he picking up on the fact that luke joins an army to overthrow the government ? is he picking up on the fact that
no hair , no eyelashes , no nothing .
he and his buddies , they were older , and they were pretty mean .
this is terminal four at heathrow , typical of any terminal — big , heavy roof , blocking out the sunlight , lots of machinery , big pipes , whirring machinery .
the green agenda is probably the most important agenda and issue of the day .
and then in the most magnificent gesture , i send the bird of peace into the azure .
and at the end i bang my hand against the pole to dislodge the bird .
well , the signal is just a molecule .
whether they leak out depends on their size .
show us the grades . &quot; &quot; and we did . the data was conclusive .
it gets taken over by children .
you give him a chainsaw . you send him to joplin , missouri after a tornado , he regains that .
thank you very much . ( applause )
a year and a half ago , four of the five people who are full time members at ushahidi , which means &quot; &quot; testimony &quot; &quot; in swahili , were ted fellows .
we got reports like this .
we &apos;ve had technologies for sequencing dna , for copying dna , and even for manipulating dna .
you might be interested to know that the crispr technology came about through a basic research project that was aimed at discovering how bacteria fight viral infections .
and then finally , we &apos;re going to try to develop and pioneer a new perspective on high seas governance that &apos;s rooted in ocean-basin-wide conservation , but framed in an arena of global norms of precaution and respect .
but the sargasso sea , the same way it aggregates sargassum weed , actually is pulling in the plastic from throughout the region .
from the photosynthetic growth , it would take 500 years of that growth to produce what we use , the 30 billion barrels we use per year .
looking at 30 billion per year , we look at our two largest suppliers , saudi arabia and now canada , with its dirty oil .
and i cleaned up the list a little bit so you can see .
basically this is the fbi offices in tampa where i spent six months of my life — back and forth , not six months continuously .
that &apos;s especially true if you &apos;re a member of the white working class .
it &apos;s hard to strike that balance , to tell a kid that life isn &apos;t fair , but also recognize and enforce in them the reality that their choices matter .
( laughter ) it &apos;s fairly self-explanatory .
and once again , it &apos;s this invitation that asks people to lay down on the glacier and give it a hug .
the world that i am describing to you is simultaneously libertarian , in that it prioritizes empowered individuals , marxist , since it will have confined to the dustbin of history the division between capital and labor , and keynesian , global keynesian .
in a sense , if i am allowed to be provocative , china today is closer to britain in the 19th century .
so this is a new species we described , from southern indiana .
all vertebrates do , and each time a fish species starts to adapt to this dark , cold , cave environment , over many , many generations , they lose their eyes and their eyesight until the end up like an eyeless cavefish like this one here .
the early years are crucial .
our population of inmates had a deficient amygdala , which likely led to their lack of empathy and to their immoral behavior .
after all , if all of us ate half as much meat , it would be like half of us were vegetarians .
so why was i stalling ?
as a data scientist , i did a lot of analyses , mostly of facilities , industrial facilities around the world .
how many ships are in all of our world &apos;s ports ?
our economies in the developed world have coasted along on something pretty close to full employment .
and my biggest worry is that we &apos;re creating a world where we &apos;re going to have glittering technologies embedded in kind of a shabby society and supported by an economy that generates inequality instead of opportunity .
here &apos;s another example : two very simple molecules , again in this kind of chemical notation .
we &apos;re using it to make better ignorance , to come up with , if you will , higher-quality ignorance .
but when he came in to lighting , we knew we had a big problem .
the director had a vision for this scene based on some wonderful footage of jellyfish in the south pacific .
i soaked it up and i thought , how could i ever have taken this for granted ?
didn &apos;t know how on earth i &apos;d ever pass a medical .
we need an integrated system that uses real time data to optimize personal mobility on a massive scale without hassle or compromises for travelers .
they thought that we were more interested , as an industry , in profits , rather than progress , and that we filled the skies with smog — and frankly , we were the enemy .
imagine you &apos;re a brilliant entrepreneur who has successfully sold that idea or that product to the global billions and become a billionaire in the process .
let me give you another number to put that in perspective , and this is a figure that was calculated in 2005 by robert reich , the secretary of labor in the clinton administration .
and when we go to cop15 at the end of this year we can &apos;t stop thinking of padding co2 .
you have the crude oil .
but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill .
in fact it &apos;s held so tightly in place that i can shake it , and the knife does not come off .
they are looking at what i &apos;ve started off on , on these more asymmetrical approaches to it , more modernist views , cause and effect .
but when it comes to knocking the brand , if the terrorists are coca-cola and we &apos;re pepsi , i don &apos;t think , being pepsi , anything we say about coca-cola , anyone &apos;s going to believe us .
looks pretty much like old-style assembly language .
stuxnet behaved like a lab rat that didn &apos;t like our cheese — sniffed , but didn &apos;t want to eat .
of course , that &apos;s not why umm el-saad joined the program .
the secular bioengineering student is quite active on social media .
she has no bonds , no connections .
these were really profound experiences .
the first mainline section of trail was opened in 2012 , and it &apos;s already generated over three billion dollars of private-sector investment .
within a month of living in paris , i &apos;d lost 15 pounds and i was in the best shape of my life because i was eating fresh food and i was walking wherever i went .
time means more to some people than others .
so if you &apos;re a shepherd or a quarryman or a farmer , you created true value .
what we should expect then is the opposite effect .
well i &apos;m going to match families on country of birth and residence , the demographics — what sex , their age — their income level within their own country , their educational achievement , a lot about their family structure .
the extreme environments of our own world are alien vistas .
( applause )
people are dancing , shouting and drinking .
he wanted a little more bombast , so he increased the size of the orchestra pit so he could get more low-end instruments in there .
it &apos;s how they understand access to this culture .
by which i don &apos;t mean amateurish culture , i mean culture where people produce for the love of what they &apos;re doing and not for the money .
well , the evidence is , unfortunately , ample .
but this gives a new paradigm to guide humanity , to put the light on our , so far overpowered industrial vehicle , which operates as if we &apos;re only on a dark , straight highway .
the minute he stops , we have neither .
so for various reasons , we took this oncogene , attached it to a blue marker , and we injected it into the embryos .
matthew &apos;s legs don &apos;t work , and he &apos;ll never walk again , and — and he does experience this as an &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; rather than a &quot; &quot; but &quot; &quot; — and he experiences himself to be healed and whole .
he &apos;s been paralyzed from the waist down since he was 13 , in a car crash that killed his father and his sister .
so what are we waiting for ?
almost twice as much sweet porridge .
i think it comes when we start to value the gift of a near win .
but this is the thing : what gets us to convert success into mastery ?
so now put yourself in a city center .
and then in 2012 , we had the rio + 20 event .
you can make a practical contribution , and for all you good folks here , next time you meet someone from china , sit down and have a conversation .
that &apos;s my mom .
if you have kids , you know what i mean .
in essence , they are not different .
this was his own assembly of heroes that kept him from drugs and gangs and from giving up on his dreams .
everyone &apos;s upset .
i began this sort of personal crusade against the mundane , because if there &apos;s one thing i &apos;ve realized , it &apos;s that any career , even one as seemingly glamorous as surf photography , has the danger of becoming monotonous .
and i don &apos;t know if it was delirium setting in or what , but they told me later i had a smile on my face the entire time .
they do it on their own tapes , with their own recording equipment ; they distribute it themselves .
because traditional economic theory would say , well , the mountain bike was probably invented by some big bike corporation that had a big r &amp; d lab where they were thinking up new projects , and it came out of there . it didn &apos;t come from there .
and what surprised me as well was that as much as this is based on the most sophisticated technology , as much as this is an incredibly new thing , the physical process itself has been around for a long time , and the culture is the same .
and in this dimension , they are incredibly small .
so , like the project we did in philadelphia , we are also invited to do workshops , for instance in curaçao , and right now we &apos;re planning a huge project in haiti .
so we thought , would that even be possible ?
how can we get so much information out of so little motion ?
now , this is a bit of a strange idea , so let me try to put it in perspective for you .
so this is it . and for those of you that weren &apos;t there , the lhc is the largest scientific experiment ever attempted — 27 kilometers in circumference .
it means we made cultural impact as well as scientific impact .
we followed , not for him , but for ourselves .
they showed up for themselves .
now , the majority of people on earth believe they have a soul , and the idea is central to many religions .
thank you .
today i &apos;m going to show you an electric vehicle that weighs less than a bicycle , that you can carry with you anywhere , that you can charge off a normal wall outlet in 15 minutes , and you can run it for 1,000 kilometers on about a dollar of electricity .
but if you come about it from a different perspective , you can create some more interesting , more novel concepts .
instead they found that it &apos;s speeding up , going faster and faster .
i mean , most of us were raised to believe that the word &quot; &quot; universe &quot; &quot; means everything .
&quot; &quot; a cloud over the cloud , &quot; &quot; was the headline .
they think of them as the annoying , frustrating obstructions , and then they rush off and do some blue-sky thinking .
it doesn &apos;t interact at all . so how do we know it &apos;s there ?
they can come through the building , through the earth — they &apos;re so non-interacting .
all of these cities , to me , still had a number of unresolved issues related to urban justice , issues of equity , inclusion and access .
there are only 27 jobs per 100 people in detroit , very different from a denver or an atlanta or a philadelphia that are anywhere between 35 to 70 jobs per 100 people .
we won &apos;t talk about santa claus then .
and it doth follow , as night the day , that thou canst not then be false to any man .
now , in order to do this , we need the right kind of language .
they think big . okay ?
so to give you a concrete feel for how a functional mri experiment goes and what you can learn from it and what you can &apos;t , let me describe one of the first studies i ever did .
the striking thing about it is that only face recognition is impaired ; everything else is just fine .
oh sure , sure , i had moments of appreciation of my body , the way an abusive parent can sometimes have a moment of kindness .
i didn &apos;t heed it ; no , i organized it and i directed it .
this time , the real politics of the contemporary world — the year of the balfour declaration , the year when the new imperial power in the middle east , britain , decides that it will declare a jewish national home , it will allow the jews to return .
he &apos;d ransacked , desecrated the temple .
what they want are implements to increase their production : something to fertilize the soil , something to protect their crop and to bring it to a market .

so this rainwater is flooding down the hillside , carrying with it sediments from the construction site , smothering the coral and killing it .
so just as we manage national parks , where we promote the growth of some species and we inhibit the growth of others , we &apos;re working towards thinking about buildings using an ecosystem framework where we can promote the kinds of microbes that we want to have indoors .
and for this reason , many people eat probiotic yogurt so they can promote a healthy gut flora .
that &apos;s walking abraham &apos;s path .
and that &apos;s what comes to the first step here .

&quot; &quot; we were living in complete chaos , &quot; &quot; eleanor said .
the answer , i believe , is yes .
we can get out of poverty .
and going to school , that &apos;s not a goal , it &apos;s a mean .
let me start with the aspect of comfort , because many people are confusing ambient temperature with thermal comfort .
so i &apos;d like to encourage you to pay attention to your thermal comfort , to your thermal environment , tonight and tomorrow , and if you &apos;d like to learn more about that , i invite you to go to our website .
and the second was the graduation to the experiment : we &apos;d fill a dumpster full of material and we &apos;d jump into it .
i feel total embarrassment over the fact that it &apos;s so nakedly clear to my crew that i &apos;m completely into wearing this costume .

we see lakes ...
and now there are thousands of these below the ocean .
it can grow ; you can grow it ; and — did i mention ? — it &apos;s quite tasty .
a core concept here is that climate change isn &apos;t something that — the answers won &apos;t land down from the moon .
step one is the step i &apos;m wearing right now , google glass .
you take all that information , and you stream it to your players .
and that was even worse than actually what had just happened in many ways , because it couldn &apos;t not work .
and when i was 12 , i became an actor .
what do you want in terms of medical intervention ?
put this in a really bright envelope with copies of your insurance cards , your power of attorney , and your do-not-resuscitate order .
so we had a real issue with communicating , and we were just not communicating , until one day i had this epiphany .
when we did our circuits course for the 155,000 students , i didn &apos;t sleep for three nights leading up to the launch of the course .
do what you can . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) so they do what they can .

it becomes a cartoon of a country house , in a cartoon of the country .
the public realm comes mostly in the form of the street in america because we don &apos;t have the 1,000-year-old cathedral plazas and market squares of older cultures .
why have a six burner stove when you rarely use three ?
so we want things that nest , we want things that stack , and we want it digitized .
i put my food waste into this dehydrating , desiccating macerator — turns food into an inner material , which i can store and then compost later .
here &apos;s a great little example .
specialized skills and facilitation skills are the combination that leads to strong success .
and the fundamental lesson , i believe , is that design truly is a contact sport .
this is their perception of why you shouldn &apos;t mess with uncontacted indians .
this is the perfect marriage of ancient shamanic wisdom and 21st century technology .
they &apos;re magnificent . you see leonardo at work .
and restructured the whole thing , including a staircase that was very important in order to precisely place &quot; &quot; the battle of anghiari &quot; &quot; on a specific area of one of the two walls .
they don &apos;t have that kind of money . instead they give each of us a seven-dollar-and-95-cent box . they &apos;re like a stealth tower installation program .
not my finest moment in new york times journalism .
and most people change their preference when i tell them that the one on the left is hitler and the one on the right is martin luther king .
and after some time , this perception became a feeling .
it was a solar wind interacting with our ionosphere that he was listening to — a phenomena which we can see at the extreme northern and southern latitudes of our planet as the aurora .
jansky had made a historic discovery , that celestial objects could emit radio waves as well as light waves .
i think my heartbeat might be the morse code for inappropriate .
that &apos;s because she dances .
&quot; you can just declassify them . &quot;
it was a significant culture shift for an organization that had secrecy in its dna .
wk : i think it will produce more than 20 the watts .
wk : i use a bicycle frame , and a pulley , and plastic pipe , what then pulls — ca : do we have a picture of that ? can we have the next slide ?
beer is a very important thing in brazil .
and there were three old ladies who lived in — that &apos;s her self-built house behind her — and they &apos;ve lived there for 30 or 40 years , and they are the backbone of the community there .
i &apos;m going to break the problem down into three parts .
volunteer : 529 . ab : 529 .
kahneman had a nice way of referring to that .
( laughter ) actually , in exeter , it &apos;s incredibly young , and i had underestimated the impact of the university in this area .
if you have a free thumb , wave it around , make sure it gets connected .
you learned , from scratch , a game you never knew before .
last year , pew and the colombia j-school analyzed the 14,000 stories that appeared on google news &apos; front page .
the combined coverage of russia , china and india , for example , reached just one percent .
you &apos;re telling each unit if it should turn right or left .
it basically embeds the most fundamental building block of computing , the digital logic gate , directly into your parts .
it is absolutely archaic that we call cancer by prostate , by breast , by muscle .
you can try to control them without that fundamental understanding of every component .
now , the prefrontal cortex , that youngest part of our brain from an evolutionary perspective , it understands on an intellectual level that we shouldn &apos;t smoke .
and the majority of them had tried this before and failed — on average , six times .
but it &apos;s a bit more complicated , because each of those 400 comes in various variants , and depending which variant you have , you might smell coriander , or cilantro , that herb , either as something delicious and savory or something like soap .
there could be all sorts of medical interventions .
so , for years agnes walked through the rift valley .

thank you .
and in the last three years , we &apos;ve been looking specifically at social media to see what has changed , and we &apos;ve discovered some very interesting things .
age demographics : the 18 to 49 demo has had a huge impact on all mass media programming in this country since the 1960s , when the baby boomers were still young .
we &apos;ve gone to immigration detention centers .
because freedom ...
jodi lomask , and her wonderful troupe capacitor , joined me in the canopy in my rainforest site in costa rica .
we had predicted that they would grow back very quickly and that they would come in encroaching from the side .
( laughter ) and also gave this fake letter from the mta to everybody — sort of like pretending that it &apos;s an art project financed by the metropolitan transit authority . ( laughter )
and i felt a little bit cheated , because the visualization — that &apos;s a really easy thing to do .
mayors are usually from the places they govern .
because i think you will find , when we talk about cities , we are talking about the political institutions in which civilization and culture were born .
i know it sounds crazy because we &apos;re obviously in the midst of an obesity epidemic , but hear me out .
getting the cause and the effect right makes all the difference in the world .
and this whole discussion as if it &apos;s some sort of economic burden , is a mystery to me .
but the money is there to reach others .
this all gets pretty exhausting , but it &apos;s just who i am .
putting out my hands and saying , &quot; &quot; hello &quot; &quot; , just so that people could hear my feminine voice .
what &apos;s at the other end of that spectrum ?
and what if duality is just the first step ?
what are we going to do about it ? i define simplicity as a means to achieving clarity , transparency and empathy , building humanity into communications .
there is no way we should do business with companies that have agreements with stealth provisions and that are unintelligible .
underpinning much of this is technology , and of late , exponentially growing technologies .

( laughter ) ( applause ) golf is the perfect seductive symbol of whitopia .
forget what a lead is supposed to look like , or a follow .
( laughter ) so you &apos;re out here on the floor , and then imagine that coming right at you .

i edited out the last bit when i asked , &quot; &quot; where is the neuron ? &quot; &quot; and she says , &quot; &quot; the neuron ? the neuron , &quot; &quot; and then she looked and did this .
i can assure you these two teams opened mine as well .
we were growing as a team .
delivering the power and the bandwidth into the ocean will dramatically accelerate adaptation .
so we can bring an entirely new telepresence to the world , throughout the ocean .
so that &apos;s where kiva is today , just to bring you right up to the present .
and i even felt a sense of shame because of that .
so we &apos;ve now accomplished the objective , which is to get the message from bob to alice without the server being able to read what &apos;s going on .
so here we have bob and alice , who want to communicate privately .
if the breast is less than 25 percent dense , that &apos;s called fatty-replaced .
it &apos;s like the essence of ted .
so we conducted a study where we recruited liberals to a study where they were supposed to write a persuasive essay that would be compelling to a conservative in support of same-sex marriage .
and what we found was that liberals tended to make arguments in terms of the liberal moral values of equality and fairness .
now we &apos;ve got to be careful here , right ?
if you have a belief transplant , would you be the same person ?
i can &apos;t be bothered with you right now . i have an idea for saving the world .
now , we &apos;re all here to dream , but maybe if we &apos;re honest about it , each of us chasing our own dream .
all that energy was pumped into the fabric of space and time itself , making the universe explode in gravitational waves .
and about 25 years ago , a particularly audacious set of people — rai weiss at mit , kip thorne and ronald drever at caltech — decided that it would be really neat to build a giant laser detector with which to search for the gravitational waves from things like colliding black holes .
and as you bring these trends together , and as you think of what it means to take people who are profoundly deaf , who can now begin to hear — i mean , remember the evolution of hearing aids , right ?
the team from rice university started to engineer the substance in red wine that makes red wine good for you into beer .
mariam is pregnant .
i suppose that will take me to my last piece — what cinema means for me .
you place the cross into the ice , in the shadow of ausangate , the most sacred of all apus , or sacred mountains of the inca .
now , i want to stress that none of these peoples that i &apos;ve been quickly talking about here are disappearing worlds .
and that is an amazing achievement when you think about us growing mustaches . ( laughter ) and for us , we have redefined charity .
so the most common question i get asked , and i &apos;m going to answer it now so i don &apos;t have to do it over drinks tonight , is how did this come about ?
he creates these fine , delicate images which he then repeats on a massive scale .
jitish kallat successfully practices across photography , sculpture , painting and installation .
and , really , that we &apos;re all just one shard of bone away from seeing the world anew .
now , one summer day in 2006 , she was at a dig site called the fyles leaf bed , which is less than 10 degrees latitude away from the magnetic north pole .
so who &apos;s the man now ? &quot; &quot; he asked them .
for a long time , this is the image of american manhood that dominated — tough , rugged , in control of his own environment .
so today , for me , being fearless means being honest .
that was awkward .
remember that 88 percent ?
care to guess who they are ?
despite that , the men and women who worked on those ships were extraordinarily proud of the work they did , and justifiably so .
( applause ) the fact is , whether you &apos;re a rock star or whether you &apos;re a welder in a shipyard , or a tribesman in the upper amazon , or the queen of england , at the end of the day , we &apos;re all in the same boat .
i &apos;ve always felt that it is impossible to engage properly with a place or a person without engaging with all of the stories of that place and that person .
( laughter ) she assumed that i did not know how to use a stove .

for example , here in california we &apos;re going to spend one billion dollars on the death penalty in the next five years — one billion dollars .
our r &amp; d folks are not only working to give us some fantastic detergents , but they &apos;re working to make sure we use less water .
and i can go on and on .
that would take us a long step along the road to autonomous vehicles that drive as well as the best humans .
it really makes you think , we &apos;d love to know what &apos;s going on inside their brain .
i never saw his face .
he was young , he was shy .
thank you .
it &apos;s about visualizing the experience that people have .
so you have to always think carefully about these decisions .
and country 2 is possibly india . &quot; &quot; actually the country with more telephones is the soviet union , and the data referred to 1989 .
they came around a corner faced with a row of machine guns .
now that to me is wisdom in action .
if you include internet telephony , you might be able to push this number up to six or seven percent , but it &apos;s nowhere near what people tend to estimate .
he really has no idea as to what &apos;s actually going on in the world .
again , after having lived for more than 200 years under the east india company and under imperial rule , indians had a very natural reaction towards globalization believing it was a form of imperialism .
we talk of people as human capital .
child : after all this time here , music is life .
since i was a boy , in my early childhood , i always wanted to be a musician , and , thank god , i made it .
and then we have this tendency , the career counselors and various people say things like , &quot; &quot; artists are not analytical .
we need to revitalize the arts and sciences of today , we need to take responsibility for the future . we can &apos;t hide behind saying it &apos;s just for company profits , or it &apos;s just a business , or i &apos;m an artist or an academician .
you would agree with me , hopefully , there &apos;s no issue of capacity anymore .
what we have done is we have developed a technology with which we can furthermore replace the remote control of our light bulb .
that &apos;s measured in the winter solstice .
and then we traveled from suburb to suburb , and i came back thinking , we &apos;ve got to reinvent the apartment building .
and there &apos;s nothing different in their wish than it was for my grandma .
and over there they don &apos;t even use one each .
he was back in luton , he was now 82 , and i hadn &apos;t seen him for 30-odd years , and when he opened the door , i saw this tiny little man with lambent , smiling eyes , and he was smiling , and i &apos;d never seen him smile .
in that first reunion , it was very awkward and tense moments , and to lessen the tension , we decided to go for a walk .
everyone has a bit of them that looks at an addict and thinks , i wish someone would just stop you .
but here &apos;s the fascinating thing : in rat park , they don &apos;t like the drug water .
it &apos;s not , it &apos;s about being a partner .
and that seemed a little strange to me when i noticed it , so i did a little digging and it turns out what you had is a hydrant and then something called a curb extension , which is like a seven-foot space to walk on , and then a parking spot .
let me advance the slide , and now i &apos;ll go back .
this is a car , and it has a lot of components , a lot of electronics in it today .
i had deep concerns for the suffering of others and a strong desire to help and bring relief to them .

the lander is then pushed out and moves towards the comet .
it had departed again .
just that little bit of money , which to me , i wish it was in my bank account — it &apos;s not , but ...
in my view , what we need today is people getting up and taking action to reclaim the meaning of peace .
and the beauty is , anybody can do it .
each red pin depicts somebody who is blind from a disease that is curable and treatable , and they &apos;re locatable .
and these preemptive attacks might not just remain in cyberspace .
the information technologies joël de rosnay was talking about , which were historically born from military research , are today on the verge of developing an offensive capability of destruction , which could tomorrow , if we &apos;re not careful , completely destroy world peace .
time perspective is the study of how individuals , all of us , divide the flow of your human experience into time zones or time categories .
we &apos;re going to call them &quot; &quot; future-oriented . &quot; &quot; their focus is on what will be .
this is called kund . we have , in english , surface water and ground water .
but they can be opened for ted people .
could we leverage the cloud ?
it is with this context that ushahidi came to be .
we find beauty in something done well .
now , keeping these ideas firmly in mind , we can say that the experience of beauty is one of the ways that evolution has of arousing and sustaining interest or fascination , even obsession , in order to encourage us toward making the most adaptive decisions for survival and reproduction .
you do it , you start it in the states , because it &apos;s , you know , concepts are very , very close to american minds .
video : narrator : an event seen from one point of view gives one impression .
ca : well , indeed .

this is bubble soccer , and it &apos;s a real sport .
here it comes at you in real speed . you &apos;ll hear this .
and they can navigate the world using their ears .
and this is what it sounds like .
he &apos;s now a friend of mine .
and then she said , &quot; &quot; you know , my husband would never understand this .
i knew i had to take a banjo with me to china .
and then i go to china and i stand on a stage at a university and i bust out into a song in chinese and everybody sings along and they roar with delight at this girl with the hair and the instrument , and she &apos;s singing their music .
and when we were walking through the narrow alleys , it was literally impossible not to step in the raw sewage and the garbage alongside the little homes .

such beautiful food , i enjoyed it . it was so beautiful .
they were very friendly .
there is just too many things to go wrong .
and does purpose play into it ?
thank you so much .
this was our first project in iquique 10 years ago .
almost 40 rap songs . ( laughter ) but the night of my speech , a surprising thing happened .
we &apos;re in a dangerous cycle .
oceans of adolescents come here to receive lessons but never learn to swim , part like the red sea when the bell rings .
taking tests is stressful , but bubbling in a scantron does not stop bullets from bursting .
because nobody can get a kickback .
but it still needs to get to people .
a large fraction of those people are in the united states .
how many ramanujans are there in india today toiling in the fields , barely able to feed themselves , when they could be feeding the world ?
just wire the chimps up to love that look , and apparently they do .
and there are lots of supernormal stimuli ; chocolate cake is one .
we sometimes get teased for our style .
our business is in the details .
we &apos;ve got to fly it first .
today , we don &apos;t talk about flying transonically , or even supersonically , we talk about flying hypersonically — not mach 2 or mach 3 , mach 20 .
( applause )
all of a sudden , we see this monarch caterpillar munching on this plant , and we realize that there it is , and it &apos;s in this empty lot in chattanooga .
( video ) comment : great job .
i hit &quot; &quot; refresh . &quot; &quot; ( video ) comment : his voice is annoying . no offense .
so , an interpreter of what ? of a piece of music , right ?
i &apos;ve decided , ultimately , that this is the wrong question , that this is not the important question .
many neuroscientists agree with this view and think that understanding will come from more detailed observation and analysis .
and there are now hundreds of labs using these approaches .
as a little girl , i always imagined i would one day run away .
no one loses their inner demons by taking to the road .
so a few years ago , my friend eric and i decided we wanted to explore this underwater cave in the foothills of the sierras .
but then we had to learn how to make them .
why aren &apos;t you home with luca ? &quot; &quot; and i said , &quot; &quot; well , i have to see . &quot; &quot; it was 2004 which was the beginning of the incredibly bloody time in iraq , &quot; &quot; i have to see , i have to see what is happening here .
your life as you know it goes into suspended animation .
now what ?
it was over .
i &apos;d like you to imagine the world anew .
now , the lights no longer show you where people are , because people are everywhere .
one is about processing information , and the other is about communication .
most of the cost was the commission to the salesmen .
that is &quot; &quot; when the world &apos;s on fire , &quot; &quot; a very old melody , in this case performed by the carter family .
we &apos;re going to begin in 1964 .
the question isn &apos;t whether or not i know you .
it continues to try to predict what i need based on some past characterization of who i am , of what i &apos;ve already done .
with whole grain bread , you have other obstacles .
i &apos;m going to go through them very quickly and then revisit them .
and this is a consequence of the fact that these new technologies tend to be digital .
and we really don &apos;t have experience with pandemics , and we &apos;re also not very good as a society at acting to things we don &apos;t have direct and sort of gut-level experience with .
when i returned to kenya in 2014 , there was 17 percent youth unemployment .
in singapore , which is ranked first , that would only take you 26 days .
i wasn &apos;t the only person grappling with these issues .
that is food and care and shelter .
the amount of human capacity out there is just amazing , and the internet connects us all .
and there are so many ways that we can form communities like that .
and evolutionary psychologists think that these intuitions have a basis in the genes .
if they get less and less happy , that will be bad for americans .
some families have fewer children .
and then , in the postwar period , you had unusually high growth rate , partly due to the reconstruction .
gamma is just one of these companies .
the company has also hired a spokesperson .
i &apos;m sure all of you read about it in the newspaper , lots of tough challenges .
and then we need to pair those medical people with the military .
pc : yeah , we have to invest in black leadership .
i witnessed my brothers and my siblings continuously stopped and frisked by law enforcement .
so i tend to avoid that .
let me show you how we do that .
that takes about two seconds to make .
in that particular test , urine either , containing a hormone called hcg , does or does not flow across a piece of paper .
try to understand that bees are very important .
and perhaps a green roof in the future , when we &apos;re further utilizing urban areas , where there are stacks of garden spaces .
because there are some advantages to inorganic systems , like higher speed semiconductors , etc .
this is a kite designed by a guy called dave kulp .
( applause )
and i believe , many scientists believe that pesticides are an important part of that decline .
this is their view to the west of the schell creek range .
it &apos;s about nine feet high .
but it didn &apos;t even slow down the animal .
it &apos;s sped up — again , it &apos;s a foot climbing .
i didn &apos;t know . i looked at that — i said , &quot; &quot; wow , is that better than the — &quot; &quot; that &apos;s my proposal on jimmy doolittle . i made that movie for television .
that &apos;s my papers .
if you &apos;re involved , say , in a travel industry in any way , look at pilgrimage .
if you want to change the world , you have to group together , you have to be collaborative .
but it is also the aging population that is multiplying in numbers .
it has sensors .
he couldn &apos;t eat .
and in it , tolstoy told of a trip that he &apos;d recently made to a very remote area of the caucasus , where there were only wild barbarians , who had never left this part of russia .
breaking celery or frozen lettuce .
( rain falls ) ( rain falls ) ( rain falls ) all right .
but especially when i was talking to the african women , i sometimes made these mistakes — it was so hard for me to learn how to listen . &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; so i conclude that , in many ways , leadership is like a panicle of rice .
and they say , &quot; &quot; i want to work in global poverty , but what will it mean about my career ?
communication was hard for isaac , and so he found a workaround to find out what he needed to know .
i need to take a breath .
he should not have been surprised .
who is going to inherit his name and his fortune ?
and it is perhaps the best example we have in los angeles of ancient extraterrestrial architecture .
this is a design by philippe starck , who i believe is in the audience at this very moment .
and i got pretty into it .
i need you to actually see this .
there &apos;s no electricity . people have three names .
it &apos;s a marker of empathy . it &apos;s a marker of accommodation .
and this is doctor who with his psychic paper .
that &apos;s the example of how legacy thinking about identity subverts the security of a well-constructed system .
there are things that are intrinsically wrong — like lying is wrong , like torturing innocent children is wrong .
it &apos;s not a matter of calculation .
that &apos;s crazy . it was never designed to do things like that .
so we &apos;ve built this system where we understand all the parts of it , but we &apos;re using it in a very , very different way than we expected to use it , and it &apos;s gotten a very , very different scale than it was designed for .
i would tell him , keep your behind in school , man , because that &apos;s where you need to be , because that &apos;s what &apos;s going to get you somewhere in life .
( laughter ) but i will tell you this : being in jail and being in prison , i came across some of the most intelligent , brilliant , and talented people that i would ever meet .
he &apos;s about my age , and he &apos;s in san quentin state prison .
so when he gives me his final paper , in which he argues that the categorical imperative is perhaps too uncompromising to deal with the conflict that affects our everyday and challenges me to tell him whether therefore we are condemned to moral failure , i say , &quot; &quot; i don &apos;t know .
and so we try to ask : what kind of school would have the teenagers fighting to get in , not fighting to stay out ?
it &apos;s not perfect yet , but we think this is one idea which can transform the lives of thousands , possibly millions , of teenagers who are really bored by schooling .
so , just take a moment .
we &apos;ve medicalized everything in this country .
and it wasn &apos;t just the usual suspects .
and as i look forward to other global issues that will require our attention this century — food security , water security , home security , forced migration — i see that we certainly do not know how we are going to solve those problems yet .
brenda laurel : i want to show you , real quickly , just a minute of &quot; &quot; rockett &apos;s tricky decision , &quot; &quot; which went gold two days ago .
girl 11 : because my older sister , she gets everything and , like , when i ask my mom for something , she &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; no &quot; &quot; — all the time .
we &apos;re trying to make balloon-powered internet .
it unlocks the potential in every idea .
and so all of western europe started buying printing presses in 1455 — to print out thousands , and then hundreds of thousands , and then ultimately millions of single , small pieces of paper that got you out of middle hell and into heaven .
this is the library of human imagination .
and of course , we used the loop of the building as a circulatory system , to thread everything together and to allow both visitors and staff to experience all these different functions in a great unity .
of course , the skyscraper is vertical — it &apos;s a profoundly hierarchical structure , the top always the best , the bottom the worst , and the taller you are , the better , so it seems .
and people say , &quot; &quot; oh , well , you &apos;ve launched this thing , and it &apos;s radioactive , into space , and what about accidents ? &quot; &quot; but we launch plutonium batteries all the time .
that &apos;s a ton of power .
now that &apos;s not a happy situation for them , but they have the confidence and the courage to come forward and say , &quot; &quot; here &apos;s what we are measuring .
and yet , we began .
if you go to one of vijay &apos;s micro-power sources , and they sell it to you for seven cents a kilowatt hour — anybody here fast in math ?
( applause ) rs : we &apos;ve got an altitude call of 368,000 feet . ( applause )
any of you who rode the automobiles — was it yesterday ? — at the track , you know the romance revolving around those high performance cars .
so my idea was that , instead of sitting down and reaching for a lot of controls , that you would sit on the chair , and it would automatically balance your weight against the force required to recline .
and this is a technique that i explored in a different project , the yahoo ! time capsule , which was designed to take a fingerprint of the world in 2006 .
what &apos;s new is that in the last several years a lot of these very traditional physical human activities , these acts of self-expression , have been moving onto the internet .
three of my players were bleeding , so i did the next best thing ...
she is the absolute worst . &quot; &quot; &quot; ashley judd , you &apos;re the reason women shouldn &apos;t vote . &quot;
eighty-two dollars a night . eighty-two dollars a night .
in washington , d.c. , long lines , queues sometimes form for important congressional hearings .
it turns out that colonies are different .
so another environmental challenge that all systems have to deal with is resources , finding and collecting them .
so thinking about outcomes , it turns out appearances matter .
here &apos;s the thing : everybody loves a beautiful baby .
and i &apos;ve come to realize that part of the problem is that today &apos;s protests have become a bit like climbing mt . everest with the help of 60 sherpas , and the internet is our sherpa .
it &apos;s not the same game , but the differences are instructive .
the school where he graduated from with his master &apos;s had just offered him a teaching appointment , which meant not only a salary , but benefits for the first time in ages .
and this is , today , the first time in any sort of public setting i &apos;ve ever acknowledged the journey that i have been on .
the trip , in other words , gave me some amazing sights , but it &apos;s only sitting still that allows me to turn those into lasting insights .
what i &apos;ve done with it sitting still , going back to it in my head , trying to understand it , finding a place for it in my thinking , that &apos;s lasted 24 years already and will probably last a lifetime .
it was an amazing moment , but it was also a scary one .
their stories matter because they contain tools the rest of us can use , and not just for those particular problems , but for many others , too .
it &apos;s not as if i had any idea what it would look like , but there was a sense that we would have to do something with new categories of workers and something having to do with behavior change and something having to do with public education .
( applause )
dl : after nearly three months at sea , she &apos;d covered over 3,000 miles .
some of them were pitchpole capsizes , flipping her end over end , and rowing became impossible .
this is the biggest global art participatory project that &apos;s going on .
kids just make photos in a class , the teacher receives them , they paste them on the school .
it &apos;s crazy .
now , that &apos;s not a new story .
&quot; &quot; as the last dodo was dying , spinoza was looking for a rational explanation for everything , called eudaemonia .
so , good things come out of , you know , incomprehension — ( laughter ) — which i will do a painting of , and then it will end up in my work .
so that means that certain parts of the periodic table are axiomatically off-limits .
this is the starting point for designing a battery — two electrodes , in this case metals of different composition , and an electrolyte , in this case salt dissolved in water .
she &apos;ll be with us as we drive , she &apos;ll help us manage the children .
when i walked inside , the lady was just finishing up one contract with some folks , some other people were coming in behind me .
why is water important ? water is important because if you want life you have to have water .
it unfolds .
all we have to do is to get our egos out of the way , get our egotism out of the way .
o , creator ! o , the objective ! the source of our being and the end of our journey , you are also the breaker of our hearts .
that is the primary function of an incubator .
four million of these babies die annually .
the third component of coke &apos;s success is marketing .
they &apos;re starting to talk about , &quot; &quot; how do you have the health community workers generate their own ideas ?
if it &apos;s not true — because it &apos;s quite a convoluted mechanism , although it &apos;s the simplest we &apos;ve been able to think of — then whatever does the job of the higgs particles we know have to turn up at the lhc .
then light began to travel through the universe .
there &apos;s a half an hour of investment in character before you get to the stuff that you &apos;re , you know , expecting .
father : &apos; cause i need it .
come on .
hey .
he gathered them together after an initial tour of that facility and he asked if there were any questions .
the night watchman had caught an employee who was stealing socks — it was a hosiery mill , and he simply backed a truck up to the loading dock and was shoveling in mountains of socks .
the work was done successfully in the field , and the data was archived and publicly disseminated through the cyark website .
in here you see a traditional 2d architectural engineering drawing that &apos;s used for preservation , and of course we tell the stories through fly-throughs .
location information can be very sensitive .
the government has hundreds of photos like this about mike going about his daily life .
three years later , those relationships still exist .
but it was then that i realized also that we have a wall of anger , of hatred and of ignorance that separates us .
and they came from all sorts of different backgrounds .
the top half is elmer &apos;s wood glue .
it &apos;s a very vestigial system .
what was that about ?
looking at these photographs today brings back the smell of smoke that lingered on my clothes when i went home to my family at night .
raku is a wonderful metaphor for the process of creativity .
but nests are not the only objects these drones can detect .
it carries a variety of sensors , and the photo quality of some of these sensors can be as high as one to two centimeters per pixel .
a single four-foot female had 300 million eggs , can carry 300 million eggs in her ovaries — imagine — and they get to be over 10 feet long . imagine what a 10 foot one has .
the mola &apos;s no exception .
the recent debate over copyright laws like sopa in the united states and the acta agreement in europe has been very emotional .
or about 75,000 jobs .
so it &apos;s the fat that drips down and flares up that causes the characteristic taste .
in order to learn them , you have to go work in those restaurants .
in a series of shows that includes &quot; &quot; 100 percent vancouver , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 100 percent berlin , &quot; &quot; rimini protokoll makes shows that actually reflect society .
they can transform cities and communities .
sub-saharan africa largely fits this description , with 22 million people living with hiv , an estimated 70 percent of the 30 million people who are infected worldwide .
for example , it is counterintuitive to have an illiterate study participant , like celine , sign a lengthy consent form that they are unable to read , let alone understand .
we &apos;ll reduce not only calories , but our carbon footprint .
and this is not only an issue of social justice , as ann cooper said — and , of course , she &apos;s completely right — but it &apos;s also one of global survival .
for 15 years nike has propped up an artificial commodities market , with a facebook-level hyped ipo every single weekend .
and that &apos;s why we &apos;re talking about sneakers .
and that allows us to understand who &apos;s doing it well , and call them out , and find out what those techniques are .
another statistic , perhaps my favorite , is to look at childhood deaths .
and the way in which you could think about us as a species and us as a planet had just changed so much , and it was incredibly exciting .
and one key way that we &apos;re going to do this is to introduce this book club .
hc : so , after about a day of chris and i staring at each other , we came up with something that was pretty close to the hamburger patty , and as you can see it basically forms like hamburger meat .
so this is a plate of nachos .
and it &apos;s addressed to a certain person .
the poem that &apos;s coming up is based on him trying to tell me a little something about a domestic point of etiquette in country living that i had a very hard time , at first , processing .
thank you .
my heart beat fast , my head was dizzy , trying to comprehend what it was that stood in front of me .
( applause )
the result : most of the deaths have been in people under 30 years of age , robustly healthy young adults .
about eight years ago , billy graham opened for me .
if any of you have sensitive stomachs or are feeling queasy , now is the time to check your blackberry .
we pretended . we all became smart cowards .
so our most powerful tool is art , because we live in a very busy world where people are so busy in their life , and they don &apos;t have time to read .
so , they spend their money trying to fix those problems .
you can &apos;t depend on foreign aid alone .
from the point of view of the experiencing self , clearly , b had a worse time .
well , it turns out that climate is not very important to the experiencing self and it &apos;s not even very important to the reflective self that decides how happy people are .
e : oh , my god ! my god ! my god !
( laughter ) sw : what about a skunk ?
i was constantly experimenting with these noises .
i didn &apos;t just trigger something which sounds like that .
thank you very much . ( applause )
experiments were all wrong .
so think of this : in 100 years , we lost the same amount of forest in the tropics that we lost in 2,000 years in temperate forests .
this allows us , among other things , to apprehend 1.4 million cubic meters of logs that were illegally taken .
thank you for listening .
thereby , helping the communities to see water hyacinth in a different light .
as a matter of fact , he had flown out here on two other occasions from new jersey to attempt suicide on this bridge .
additionally , that very few who have jumped off the bridge and lived and can talk about it , that one to two percent , most of those folks have said that the second that they let go of that rail , they knew that they had made a mistake and they wanted to live .
that &apos;s what i wanted to do .
i simply needed vision and belief .
and you can see from these images , the site is so raw and almost archaeological .
so i &apos;ll play you just a short excerpt of a mockup that we made of a couple of these voices , but you really get a sense of the poetry of everyone &apos;s reflection on the event .
and one of my most enduring memories is in 1999 , mary reading to me and the children down near manly beach &quot; harry potter and the philosopher &apos;s stone . &quot;
this now allowed me to read back what i &apos;d written and to enter the computer world , even with its 84k of memory .
did you know rats that ate genetically engineered corn had developed signs of liver and kidney toxicity ?
hello . my name is birke baehr , and i &apos;m 11 years old .
thank you .
he once told me — he looked kind of sad ; he worries very much about the haves and have-nots .
i literally drew on the walls of the trailer , mocked it up in cardboard , we &apos;d come in and cut , decide things were wrong , pull it out , put it back in .
all the casework is hand-scribed in , uniquely , so you can &apos;t just cut 100 parts for 100 trailers , you have to cut them big , and every single one is hand-fit .
maybe they should be able to anticipate what you &apos;re about to do .
so we ended up actually getting the money to build this robot , which was nice .
and these modules were organized in hierarchies , and we created that hierarchy with our own thinking .
so i &apos;m walking along and i say , &quot; &quot; oh , there &apos;s chris anderson .
they don &apos;t get treated , they don &apos;t get detected , they don &apos;t get the benefit of all the modern medicines .
and she started , in the face of a lot of controversy , the women &apos;s health initiative .
growing up , i played hockey until i was 12 years old .
hello .
but before we pat ourselves too much on the back , we have poured 151 megawatt hours of energy into constructing this house when there was a house there before .
for example : is this evil ?
we risk vulnerability — this is something men don &apos;t do .
i read a lot so , as lily knows all too well , my books that i like , i send to my friends .
each one of these organisms that we &apos;ve described — that you &apos;ve seen from jamie and others , these magnificent things — what they &apos;re doing , each one of them , is they &apos;re hacking the rules of life .
so we &apos;ve all heard about the amish giving up cars .
this one &apos;s several stories tall .
gets up to 600 , 700 degrees f , somewhere in that range .
it will be more like a living organism than just a collection of very complex technology .
so we see a clear need of active health promotion , especially in the case of the old people .
audience member : 10 of hearts .
hg : indeed ! it was the 17 .
( applause ) ca : are you going to come back to india with some of this , at some point ?
that &apos;s fantastic .
in my high school , ursuline academy , the nuns made service and social justice a high priority in the school .
given the option , they will have fewer children .
we collect four gigabits per second of data , if you can imagine that kind of data stream coming down .
i can get the next image . i can blend and transition .
and if mama eternal has taught us correctly , this song will make sense , not only to those of us who are a part of this gathering , but to all who sign the charter for compassion .
but now , to be a good samaritan — and i always say , and to be a good american — for me , is not simply to congratulate myself for the individual acts of care .
so we did the following experiment .
so production and comprehension rely on very similar processes .
they are hospital ships .
can you pick out the two us army soldiers in this photograph ?
we have about a quarter of a million in transit to those and other children , and then there are another quarter of a million more that are being ordered at this moment .
her mother had not gone to primary school .
i also try to challenge myself to do things that doctors say are not possible .
so , it &apos;s like base camp , everest .
we found absolutely no correlation , no impact whatsoever , between these two variables .
it was also people &apos;s deep longing for freedom .
that &apos;s an enormous model .
we applied this algorithm to millions of google street view images across hundreds of american cities , and we have learned something really interesting : first , it confirmed our common wisdom that car prices correlate very well with household incomes .
let &apos;s build a better map of the world .
as arab states tragically collapse , what is left behind but the ancient cities , such as cairo , beirut and baghdad ?
here we have the mars science laboratory on its way to mars , just launched last weekend .
it only looks like nothing &apos;s moving because , well , saturn here is 700,000 miles away , and titan here is 4,000 to 5,000 miles away .
here i was fumbling around in the ladies &apos; underwear department of a department store , almost got escorted from the premises .
this is my new , purpose-built , x-ray shed .
i walked into a cell house that was five tiers high .
disturbances died down in the general population .
but it also tells us something about one of these things that we think that we know .
but even worse — some years it &apos;s only iv drug users , some years it &apos;s only pregnant women .
it runs on the fact that you make tests and experiments that don &apos;t work , otherwise you &apos;re not learning . it runs on the fact
i think these things also would help us embrace ai , because it &apos;s only by embracing it that we actually can steer it .
well there , i think the answer is very clear : they &apos;re in business .
there &apos;s a lot of bad actors out there that have done the wrong thing , that actually have made the problem worse .
fifty percent will have onset by age 14 , 75 percent by age 24 , a picture that is very different than what one would see if you &apos;re talking about cancer or heart disease , diabetes , hypertension — most of the major illnesses that we think about as being sources of morbidity and mortality .
it &apos;s kind of an extraordinary story when you realize that this is twice as common as homicide and actually more common as a source of death than traffic fatalities in this country .
and we had enough passion to will the processes and technology into existence .
and then , again , the final shot .
the work as an apprentice was very primitive .
however , everybody in the factory spent his time at the art department .
( applause ) now if you &apos;ll allow me , i would love to share a one-minute film that has proven to show that a 60-sec film can be as powerful as a haiku in telling a big picture .
our mission is of cultural integration and independence .
where will we take it ?
this is an investigational technology , but , in clinical trials , we &apos;re seeing a 44 to 64 percent decrease in chronic pain patients .
google has started to digitize 15 million books .
jm : now you can actually look at the distribution of suppression indexes over whole populations .
for starters , we now live longer , and so age more slowly .
it was all a bit disheartening .
they get in the gulf stream , they go all the way to europe .
they can handle a hurricane that comes and goes .
even just this one second allows me to remember everything else i did that one day .
early on , i think i had a couple of videos where you would see me in it , but i realized that wasn &apos;t the way to go .
so i had the computer program design the short staples to do this .
( laughter ) so , it turns out we actually had this idea nine years ago , and that &apos;s about the time constant for how long it takes to do these kinds of things , so i think we made a lot of progress .
now , who should we thank for the success ?
( music ) again you see the beautiful body language . ( music )
so here &apos;s what you do .
each of them taken together is unlikely .
thank you .
i saw the concept first in the darpa grand challenges where the u.s. government issued a prize to build a self-driving car that could navigate a desert .
in our studies , we represent the everyday life of people in this simple scheme .
and we can measure this very precisely , actually , because we give people electronic pagers that go off 10 times a day , and whenever they go off you say what you &apos;re doing , how you feel , where you are , what you &apos;re thinking about .
if we eat raw food , we cannot release really the energy .
it &apos;s very expensive .
you can take patients who are less sick , and bring them back to an almost asymptomatic state through that kind of therapy .
this is a 78 year-old man who &apos;s lost the end of his fingertip .
can you see it ?
and we can measure this very , very precisely with kepler and trace their effects .
that is the equivalent of what we face now .
do you know why they do this ?
early each morning i would crawl into bed with her and sleep with her .
these kinds of losses are out of our control .
here &apos;s a modern example you will all relate to : searching the internet .
what is it that french people do better than all the others ?
everyone in this room has been affected by a teacher or an adult .
we know why kids don &apos;t learn .
you want a dirty magazine ?
and there &apos;s very illegal hustles , which you smuggle in , you get smuggled in , drugs , pornography , cell phones , and just as in the outer world , there &apos;s a risk-reward tradeoff , so the riskier the enterprise , the more profitable it can potentially be .
( laughter ) real falcons out of slightly doctored chickens .
so , this is an emotional topic . some people stand .
thank you . ( applause ) ( applause ) thank you .
there is some good news . first of all , let me say , we &apos;ve come a long , long way .
so , we went through our 15 commodities .
but we can &apos;t do everything .
and stack can mean this way , or it can mean this way , or it can mean in some arbitrary n-dimensional space .
thank you very much .
now , throughout history , men practically had a license to cheat with little consequence , and supported by a host of biological and evolutionary theories that justified their need to roam , so the double standard is as old as adultery itself .
but they find themselves in a conflict between their values and their behavior .
and in a way , africa is more than a tragedy , in more ways than one .
that is not the kind of system africans had known for centuries .
what rises twice a year , once in easter and then two weeks before christmas , has a mini peak every monday , and then flattens out over the summer ?
they &apos;re not as true as they could be .
this is feudalism : one owner , many workers .
so what about us ? what about our generation , and our media revolution , the internet ?
this is a very strange moment where we were asked by the bureaucracy at the mall how much time would it take to install .
there is a huge disconnect , we believe , between the communicative and discursive space of the mall and the museums that line it to either side .
dereck joubert : well , our lives have basically been like a super long episode of &quot; &quot; csi &quot; &quot; — something like 28 years .
it &apos;s simply not sustainable .
now you can try to change the temperature in your house by opening a window in the winter , but that &apos;s not going to change the setting on the thermostat , which will respond by kicking on the furnace to warm the place back up .
adding just one healthy habit pulls overweight people back into the normal range .
to bring a successful drug to market , it takes , on average , 13 years — that &apos;s one drug — with a sunk cost of 4 billion dollars , and only one percent of the drugs that start down that road are actually going to get there .
the people for whom it was a lifesaver could have still taken their medicine .
at the end of the semester , we &apos;re taking a trip to mexico , all expenses paid .
i &apos;d like to be the person to edit this all together . &quot; &quot; i said , &quot; &quot; thank you , scott . i &apos;m so glad that you found me . &quot; &quot; and scott aggregated all of the videos .
i went to the local greengrocer , and i went to a farmer who was throwing away potatoes because they were the wrong shape or size for supermarkets .
it is a success story . it has been a success story .
but if we keep running this for a while , we find out that although the pattern we get is very intricate , it has a very regular structure .
so here it is .
it &apos;s a process by which a molecule can get from the outside of the cell to the inside by getting captured in a bubble or a vesicle that then gets internalized by the cell .
take a look at this drawing .
narrator : as the hunters display their kills , something surprising happens .
that &apos;s no longer the case . logging roads provide access to urban areas .
( laughter ) a 37-year-old road worker .
so , here you see the cast . these are all of the people in &quot; &quot; the whale hunt &quot; &quot; and the two whales that were killed down here .
the thing that caused massive policy changes to occur was race to the top for education .
my father worked at this factory , &quot; &quot; he said .
we get things like , &quot; &quot; i want to die .
and i hope that she is somewhere safe and healthy , and i hope that she sees this talk and she knows that her desperation and her courage inspired the creation of crisis text line and inspires me every freaking day .
it was also materials .
nine times , i climbed to the top of her 90-foot mast .
if you look at the employees aged 21 to 30 , this number is even higher .
we did something else .
we &apos;re just seeing the coarse-scale geometry here .
and the lighting that we use these days looks something like this .
this is where i come from , todmorden .
it &apos;s a stylized map of togmorden .
it &apos;s a very sad story .
and one day , my father actually took me into the bush .
bono spoke very eloquently , that we have the tools , for the first time , to address age-old problems of disease and poverty .
e-commerce has been growing exponentially . it &apos;s now a trillion dollars .
and for them it was not about politics , it was about serving with purpose .
this team of women , in many ways , was like women everywhere .
that would take between one and three square kilometers of footprint on the ground , entirely .
matching the reliability , base load is actually irrelevant .
code is the next universal language .
the kids of today , they tap , swipe and pinch their way through the world .
again , back in the &apos; 70s , a lot &apos;s changed since then , back in the &apos; 70s , one in 10 americans was obese .
but of course , we can do better .
i thought , what a great way to get to school .
so , i &apos;m not going to quote myself on this .
and so the victorians were trying to live through and simultaneously invent a whole new scale of living : this scale of living that we , you know , now call &quot; &quot; metropolitan living . &quot; &quot; and it was in many ways , at this point in the mid-1850s , a complete disaster .
and eventually snow made a map of the outbreak .
here it kind of looks like he &apos;s looking for a date , but what he &apos;s really looking for is for someone to shovel him out when he gets snowed in , because he knows he &apos;s not very good at fighting fires when he &apos;s covered in four feet of snow .
and then seattle decided to use it to get citizens to clear out clogged storm drains .
and i was lucky because i had lots of options .
it was cancer . it was the bad kind .
so we &apos;ve got to become a really good mapper to do this .
so the earth was probably about three to five degrees colder overall , and much , much colder in the polar regions .
the telephone was invented while developing a communication tool for hearing impaired people .
things that until then seemed simple became almost impossible to do alone .
think of the implications .
so , i hope to pierce that prejudice forever with this group .
( laughter ) matty has found this ingenious way to leverage the kindness of strangers .
&quot; &quot; your mic wasn &apos;t off during sound check .
you can go on the website , download all the design files , make them yourself .
and it &apos;s been an incredible experience .
probably the world will do this .
that has now disappeared , and they are now in great economic problem .
so with some friends we started to do different tricks , like for example this jump here , i jumped from a paraglider .
and probably the most important is you have to work on your mental skills , mental preparation .
housing 550 babies , this was ceausescu &apos;s show orphanage , and so i &apos;d been told the conditions were much better .
the head nurse told me proudly , &quot; you see , our children are very well-behaved . &quot;
my relationship is with accra , where my mother lives , where i go each year , with the little garden in dzorwulu where my father and i talk for hours .
i &apos;m often asked if i plan to &quot; &quot; go back &quot; &quot; to ghana .
thank you very much . chris anderson : that &apos;s it ?
that was really exciting for us to see that .
they inverted the whole idea of development .
i &apos;m going to present three projects in rapid fire .
tinkering school is a place where kids can pick up sticks and hammers and other dangerous objects , and be trusted .
video : three , two , one , go !
these are hundreds of classes .
i took the same concept of mindfulness , because , why did i bring meditation into the indian prison ?
that doesn &apos;t make sense .
think about the human being .
you &apos;ve got illegal logging and deforestation still on a very large scale , or you can have fantastic , responsible forestry that we can be proud of .
why would we not want to have a positive impact on the world as a business ?
carol isn &apos;t the first , and certainly won &apos;t be the last , to find herself in this kind of fearsome environment , worrisome situation caused by gps tracking .
in fact , many of you navigated here today with the help of your tomtom or your smartphone .
we want something , therefore we buy it .
now , i looked at a number of kettles available on the market , and found the minimum fill lines , so the little piece of information that tells you how much you need to put in there , was between two and a five-and-a-half cups of water just to make one cup of tea .
now , weekend in paris , weekend in rome — these are different things .
and the question was , will ugly jerry and ugly tom help their respective , more attractive brothers ?
sometimes it does get a little bit hard to walk your talk .
and conversely , that highlights those who do not have the sticker .
oh , there we are . we can save it now .
child : tv . ( children react ) child : oh my god .
simple as that , right ? no biggie .
it &apos;s peer respect that drives us .
so what &apos;s starting to happen , if you think about money , if you sort of boil money down to an essence , it is literally just an expression of value , an agreed value .
so i think , you know , will we be standing on stage buying a coffee — organic , fair trade coffee — next year using ted florins or ted shillings ?
this is mao tse-tung . he brought health to china .
so we can see a lot happening in data in the coming years .
in the year she had the jeep , she saved 4,500 girls from being cut .
there are people not like you — people who you now call enemies .
find it and try to find yourself in there .
you know , i might not have me no place to lay my head at night , but that just makes me houseless .
the christian story , jesus was dead a whole day in the tomb before he was resurrected .
one of the other things that i loved about being a chaplain was seeing patients a year , or even several years after their treatment , because it was just really cool to see how they had changed and how their lives had evolved and what had happened to them .
let &apos;s call this scheme &quot; &quot; print aid . &quot; &quot; and here &apos;s how it might work .
but it took an innocent question from my then-four-year-old daughter to make me appreciate that .
i have a dream that we can stop thinking that the future will be a nightmare , and this is going to be a challenge , because , if you think of every major blockbusting film of recent times , nearly all of its visions for humanity are apocalyptic .
and just a father and son trying to survive , walking along the road .
the default image on the object would probably be a high-resolution earth image .
this is a bronze ball , an aluminum arm here , and then this wooden disk .
i don &apos;t want to be haunted by such images any more .
i mean , this could be huge .
because sometimes , as proust says , mystery is not about traveling to new places , but it &apos;s about looking with new eyes .
but novelty isn &apos;t about new positions .
also the person sitting in your very seats is a liar .
we &apos;re against lying , but we &apos;re covertly for it in ways that our society has sanctioned for centuries and centuries and centuries .
and he often said , the demo only has to work once , because the primary mode of us impacting the world was through large companies being inspired by us and creating products like the kindle or lego mindstorms .
this is a recent thing , but this will happen and this will change just like it did with software .
i love trees , and i &apos;m very lucky , because we live near a wonderful arboretum , and sundays , usually , i &apos;d go there with my wife and now , with my four-year-old , and we &apos;d climb in the trees , we &apos;d play hide and seek .
( thunder ) text : you can say a story is fabricated .
it &apos;s not in their taste , really . it &apos;s not in their texture .
it &apos;s in the smell .
why was it that , when i had an operation , my doctor said to me , &quot; &quot; beware , ms. hertz , of hyperpyrexia , &quot; &quot; when he could have just as easily said , &quot; watch out for a high fever . &quot;
in washington , the president of the united states is sitting in the oval office , assessing whether or not to strike al qaeda in yemen .
that &apos;s what we &apos;re after .
so you &apos;re going to put your thumb on top of this .
so it &apos;s much closer , in a way , to a data fungus , in a sense , wrapped around that page , than it is to a deliberate link that i &apos;ve placed there .
our good friend chris has about a six percent — but with a bullet , i might add .
( laughter ) audience : shake . fold .
there &apos;s the one that cuts itself .
unfortunately , though , the site was separated from the river by mclean boulevard so i suggested , &quot; &quot; let &apos;s reroute mclean , &quot; &quot; and that gave birth instantly to friends of mclean boulevard .
the pilgrims come here by the hundreds of thousands — they &apos;re not going to get in trucks and buses and go down there .
it &apos;s called the giant magellan telescope , or gmt .
so we know there &apos;s at least one planet , our own earth , in which there is life .
and people are suffering from all kinds of pain like neuropathic pain , lower-back pain and cancer pain from bone metastases , when the metastases get to your bones , sometimes they are very painful .
he took the treatment , and on the way back , he drove the truck by himself .
ten times a day , they extract the 10-foot long cylinder of compressed ice crystals that contain the unsullied air and trace chemicals laid down by snow , season after season for thousands of years .
moreover , in this 8,000-mile journey , they have to insure this ice doesn &apos;t melt .
let &apos;s start with day and night .
so , cut to the modern day .
and i think the technology &apos;s on our side .
most of the work takes place outside of the monetary economy in what &apos;s called the social economy or the core economy , which is people doing it for themselves .
his name is matthieu ricard .
it means being able to observe our thought stream and the process of emotion with high clarity , objectivity and from a third-person perspective .
now it &apos;s time to leave the capsule if you dare .
ag : liftoff .
today , eight million people have access to antiretroviral drugs .
that was common practice in the industry , and those who held patents on airplanes were defending them fiercely and suing competitors left and right .
gorgeous assistant instructor .
here is an example of the stroke .
that &apos;s a lot of clear-cuts .
kkhh !
what we are trying to do is to come up with a single species that can survive anywhere in the world , where there &apos;s barren desert .
our job at nasa is to take the experimental and computational and make a better mixing for the closed photobioreactors .
the thing is , they see their lives and the risks they run decidedly differently .
pulling water from a well and end it at midnight poised to beat a bucket with a stick and scare off wild boar that might mess with their potatoes , their only company a bit of homemade moonshine vodka .
the application that we built is for college campuses .
meaning , there &apos;s a 99 percent chance that they &apos;ll get away with it .
we are going to need a new generation of citizen leaders willing to commit ourselves to growing and changing and learning as rapidly as possible .
is there a frontier for us of how we live together ?
so as you &apos;ll guess , this is a hospital .
but what they realized when they started offering chemotherapy is the patients rarely wanted to get in cars .
so it &apos;ll be made of the same cotton cloth , same balloon , same internal pressure .
but when i went to graduate school to study biomechanics , i really wanted to find a dissertation project that would expand our knowledge of skeletal function .
and then we had to make a lot of them .
and you can also manipulate and collaborate on 3d data sets as well , so you can gesture around them as well as manipulate them .
i asked them to produce a little movie about it .
again , &quot; &quot; thrilled &quot; &quot; to learn .
without memory we would be amnesiacs .
now i am a believer in democracy .
the same happened for me .
there &apos;s love and there &apos;s friendship and there &apos;s protection .
so , i started a company with stan winston , my good friend stan winston , who is the premier make-up and creature designer at that time , and it was called digital domain .
so , you know , here i am now , on the deck of titanic , sitting in a submersible , and looking out at planks that look much like this , where i knew that the band had played .
but when it comes down to it , ghana found itself in the same place in which the u.s. election stalled in the 2000 presidential elections — bush versus gore .
now the second round of voting did not bring forth a clear winner either .
i have talked about it a million times , but it &apos;s unbelievable .
the other thing it shows you is that , although there &apos;s this beautiful forest of coral , there are no fish in that picture .
my colleague , jason peat , who runs this program , tells me it &apos;s 10 times faster and 10 times cheaper than the traditional way of doing things .
we have just published an evaluation of this program , and the evidence that is there for all to see is quite remarkable .
you place it in a science museum , it becomes a three-dimensional visualization of data .
a basket is made up of horizontal and vertical elements .
( applause )
because we ’ re far from home , we ’ re very tired . &quot; &quot; and the old lady said , &quot; &quot; oh yes , come on in . &quot; &quot; it was come dark and rain , will make you weary and tired .
he &apos;d just been diagnosed with als , which is a disease that the average lifespan is three years .
all of our hopes and dreams , what we want to accomplish , is different , and our paths will be different , they are all stories .
their beauty immerses us with color , taste , touch .
if you do nothing else but to cultivate that response to the great gift that this unique day is , if you learn to respond as if it were the first day in your life and the very last day , then you will have spent this day very well .
and i wouldn &apos;t be lying , but i wouldn &apos;t totally be telling you the truth , either , because the truth is , that &apos;s just the life everyone else sees .
i have for the last six years of my life , and i continue to every day .
then , uganda started to turn back , whereas zimbabwe skyrocketed , and some years later south africa had a terrible rise of hiv frequency .
( applause ) aids was discovered 1981 ; the virus , 1983 .
so this is a plant that is mimicking the first plant .
but they really need to spread their genes to mix with other genes so that they can adapt to environmental niches .
and if you succeed , wonderful .
well , we live in a world where what we think of , what we invest in , is the outcome .
and at my feet was the great , still blue plate of the pacific ocean .
and it &apos;s only by stepping out of your life and the world that you can see what you most deeply care about and find a home .
that &apos;s why i like what i do .
plastic just is not going to do it . &quot; &quot; we sort of worked things out .
there &apos;s one particular curious meme which i rather enjoy .
it always comes back , as richard dawkins complained all that long time ago , it always comes back to genes .
and then they went to see if these trials had been published in the peer-reviewed academic literature . and this is what they found .
i don &apos;t believe in precognition , and every now and then , you hear that somebody has been able to predict something that happened in the future , and that &apos;s probably because it was a fluke , and we only hear about the flukes and about the freaks .
now , malaria &apos;s transmitted by a mosquito , and normally if you &apos;re infected with malaria , and you &apos;re feeling sick , it makes it even easier for the mosquito to bite you .
here &apos;s a girl who &apos;s almost dead .
in other words , if somebody touches me , my hand , neuron in the somatosensory cortex in the sensory region of the brain fires .
so , this made evolution suddenly lamarckian , instead of darwinian .
i think of the difference of google video versus youtube .
every single decision , i have to think about what is right for both sides .
but all our fabrication is down in this lower left corner .
the person who runs it nicely describes it as &quot; machines that make machines need businesses that make businesses : &quot; it &apos;s a cross between micro-finance and vc to do fan-out , and then the research partnerships back at mit for what &apos;s making it possible .
first of all , for exceptions , there are a lot of them and they &apos;re important .
the biases , whether intentional or otherwise , are pervasive , and so are the misleading mental images .
i do experiments to test how different chemicals in the brain influence the choices we make .
( &quot; &quot; official ! chocolate stops you being grumpy &quot; &quot; ) cheese ? chocolate ? where did that come from ?
there &apos;s all sorts of great things you can do by adding a photo to a tweet .
( laughter ) but you still have to do it , particularly if you &apos;re marrying 500 million tweets per day .
i liked being on time . i liked getting my work done .
and it won &apos;t be easy — that &apos;s for sure .
now , as it turns out , i &apos;m a neuroscientist , so i knew that the memory of that person and the awful , emotional undertones that color in that memory , are largely mediated by separate brain systems .
sr : &quot; &quot; did that just work ? &quot; &quot; xl : &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; i said . &quot; &quot; indeed it worked ! &quot; &quot; we &apos;re really excited about this .
or , the software is gpl , so it &apos;s open-source as well .
you know , when i was learning about programming , i learned by looking at other people &apos;s code , or looking at other people &apos;s circuits in magazines .
it has a deep melancholy ring .
so buried in signage are these structures , that it often takes a moment to distinguish the modern specially constructed taxpayer from its neighbor : the small commercial building from an earlier century , whose upper floors have been sealed , and whose groundfloor space now functions as a taxpayer .
and when the capsule of my balloon was introduced officially in the air and space museum in washington , together with the airplane of charles lindbergh , with apollo 11 , with the wright brothers &apos; flyer , with chuck yeager &apos;s 61 , i had really a thought then .
which will be the altitude at which you would like to fly in your life , to get to the success that you wish to have , to get to the point that really belongs to you , with the potential you have , and the one you can really fulfill ?
so we could show the firing rate of that neuron as a function of the animal &apos;s location .
and scientists have begun to understand how spatial memory works by recording from individual neurons in rats or mice while they forage or explore an environment looking for food .
this is an oxo potato peeler .
my work most recently took me to haiti .
to me , words are more like instincts and language .
the photographer told me to look flirty .
how could we survive that ?
and we will probably put 1,800 megawatts of solar systems to produce 3.5 million cubic meters of water .
should &apos;ve been a dancer .
but where are we now ?
according to the standard model , the textbook model , scientists develop hypotheses , they deduce the consequences of those hypotheses , and then they go out into the world and they say , &quot; okay , well are those consequences true ? &quot;
well , scientists can model it using a computer simulation .
and the one thing that i have learned is that transformation comes when i &apos;m not in charge , when i don &apos;t know what &apos;s coming next , when i can &apos;t assume i am bigger than everything around me .
there were broken shacks all around .
and christian majority religions , we see in these countries . they are blue .
congo will go from 60 to 120 .
because that is where dignity really starts .
because of some of technologies we &apos;ve been talking about .
so here &apos;s what i say to teenagers .
well , in latin america , they &apos;d say to me , &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t really cut off the supply .
i traveled enormously as a child .
and you have to remember it .
( music ) for this delight and for this wonder , people rejoiced .
one taiwanese production studio would interpret american politics in 3d .
now we know that a root apex has just a few hundred cells that show this kind of feature , but we know how big the root apparatus of a small plant , like a plant of rye .
this has been something that has been refused for centuries , despite the evidence .
so when you hear about corruption , don &apos;t just feel that nothing is being done about this — that you can &apos;t operate in any african country because of the overwhelming corruption . that is not the case .
there are no slides , so you &apos;ll just have to be content with me .
everybody was blaming everybody else .
those divisions are things we really need to recognize and take seriously .
because it &apos;s hollow , it &apos;s lightweight , light enough to be lifted by just a few men , or , apparently , one woman .
you can feel the texture under bare feet .
and yet we also live at the moment when our ability to eliminate those conditions has reached a height we never imagined before .
the experience of down syndrome people includes those who are actors , those who are writers , some who are able to live fully independently in adulthood .
and this forest keeps growing exponentially .
they produce the nutrients in the soil naturally .
so what can we do to stop coal &apos;s emissions in time ?
this week , between one and three one-gigawatt coal plants are being turned on around the world .
imagine a scenario where during your regular checkup , your doctor can take a simple , noninvasive urine sample , or other liquid biopsy , and present you with the results before you even leave the doctor &apos;s office .
my research team of engineers and biochemists is working on exactly this challenge .
we &apos;ll just make it out of old bicycle parts using a windmill , as william kamkwamba did .
but first , i &apos;m going to ask you some other questions .
♫ founding fathers all had slaves . ♫ sweeney : i know .
♫ dorothy parker , mean , drunk and depressed . ♫ sweeney : i know .
uncovering this — that is the power of conservation photography .
in 2005 , after only a single decade of protection , scientists measured the largest recovery of fish ever recorded .
now , about 20 years ago , all that began to change .
it has memories , like scenes from your childhood playing before you .
but in our case , the phase transition is not a change in the way the molecules are arranged inside the material , but is about a change of the very fabric of space-time .
for instance , the tunnel diode , a component used in electronics , works thanks to the wonders of quantum tunneling .
we do something to something and just like magic , it moves . the blob .
this is a true story , my personal story .
it was crucial that the students see that we &apos;re working hard for them and they &apos;re all supporting each other .
stanford coursera , udacity , mitx and others have more classes coming .
this was a little grocery store , a food lion grocery store , that is now a public library .
the creek had been culverted under the parking lot .
so here &apos;s another few people trying it out .
if we overshoot , we can pour a little bit back .
they came from computer scientists , engineers .
perhaps like we should understand that business can &apos;t succeed in a world that &apos;s failing .
so we &apos;re using an enormous amount of land for agriculture , but also we &apos;re using a lot of water .
this is a picture that al gore gave me a few years ago that he took when he was in the soviet union a long , long time ago , showing the fishing fleets of the aral sea .
so you could tell it the temperature you wanted at a certain time .
so , it doesn &apos;t matter what you &apos;re doing .
the last ice age started roughly 120,000 years ago .
bumped into eurasia around 16 million years ago , and then we had the first african exodus , as we call it .
the second thing we bring up is what we call the browning of the tmt , the top management teams .
it &apos;s not a new product or a new process but a new way to organize work , and the most significant management innovation to come out of india , invented by the indian offshoring industry is what we call the global delivery model .
two men , rahul and rajiv , living in the same neighborhood , from the same educational background , similar occupation , and they both turn up at their local accident emergency complaining of acute chest pain .
for me , what &apos;s truly sundar about the idea of task shifting , though , isn &apos;t that it simply makes health care more accessible and affordable but that it is also fundamentally empowering .
when you &apos;re only surrounded by people who speak the same vocabulary as you , or share the same set of assumptions as you , you start to think that that &apos;s reality .
i was thinking about what moshe safdie said yesterday about beauty because in his book , hyde says that sometimes trickster can tip over into beauty .
another is to change our lifestyles .
and other things that can make it worse , that can cause you to lose brain cells .
so let &apos;s assume now that we can get the countries that are currently underperforming on social progress — the russia , china , indias — just up to the average .
it also tells us that we &apos;re not slaves to gdp .
you see increasingly that the world now looks actually , for us europeans , much more like europe in the 19th century .
take the last financial crisis after the second world war .
and it is this very limitation and my desire to connect with people that inspires me as a creator .
we &apos;re taking the first steps .
simply insert part a into slot b , and we should all be good to go .
and it uses this dexterity to bypass the vagina altogether and deposit sperm directly into the female &apos;s uterus , not to mention it &apos;s a pretty good size .
and then you have to store them at about minus 20 degrees c — that &apos;s about minus four fahrenheit , i think — with a very critically low moisture content .
now plants are under threat .
and he didn &apos;t speak vietnamese .
if she fails , we &apos;re all headed to the gallows ; if she passes , we can leave to vietnam .
he was going to tattoo little black dots on the right side of my face and make me look very symmetric .
but this was not the case .
but is it rebuilding trust ?
so if we can focus the design mind on creating positive , reinforcing relationships in architecture and through architecture , i believe we can do much more than create individual buildings .
a great deal of them .
now here at ted , we &apos;re solving some of the great riddles of science and mysteries of the universe .
this is a young chimp . the young ones are better than the old ones , just like humans .
we &apos;re actually going to make the left , left payoff for the matcher a little bit higher .
for me , the wheelchair becomes a vehicle for transformation .
you &apos;re all part of the artwork too .
but how are we going to know who they are when we &apos;ve been told to avoid and be afraid of them ?
i &apos;m sure i &apos;m going to blow this . &quot; &quot; okay , maybe , but this thing is not about perfection . it &apos;s about connection .
reach out to them .
( laughter ) i &apos;ll never forget that moment sitting there with him — how free he was in his happiness .
and it is his spirit and his optimism that is in my dna .
please don &apos;t — let go of me !
it looks nasty , like in college when you didn &apos;t like statistics .
and all these colored lines here are results ; each color is one survey .
so the first is apple .
thirty-five million .
gustavo dudamel !
we are very happy because we have the opportunity to have this angel in the world — not only in our country , venezuela , but in our world .
this male snake , 12 feet long , met another male king cobra .
but they do also a lot of other remarkable things .
rm : the &quot; &quot; double raindrop &quot; &quot; i worked on for nine months , and when i finally turned it on , i actually hated it .
( laughter ) four hundred aluminum cans .
in the last century — that &apos;s the one that was seven years ago — half a billion people died from smallpox : more than all the wars in history , more than any other infectious disease in the history of the world .
as we look at these trends , do we become despondent , or will we become energized ?
when i arrived in kiev , on february 1 this year , independence square was under siege , surrounded by police loyal to the government .
if the men showed the ideal of the warrior , then the women showed the implications of such violence .
music lovers and jazz lovers alike , please give a warm hand of applause for the one and only mr. peeping tom . take it away .
i &apos;m very , very stoked to be here today , representing my kinfolk and all those that haven &apos;t managed to make a career out of an innate ability for inhuman noisemaking .
it &apos;s not , and binging is never good .
you all know about multitasking . you all have been faulty of multitasking when you &apos;re driving and you pick up your cellphone . bad idea . very bad idea .
now , what can we say about democracy in lesterland ?
one is called the general election .
but just like any other technology , vaccines have their shortcomings , and the needle and syringe is a key part within that narrative — this old technology .
so let &apos;s start with the first one , this immunogenicity idea .
now drake did not discover extraterrestrial intelligence , but he learned a very valuable lesson from a passing aircraft , and that &apos;s that terrestrial technology can interfere with the search for extraterrestrial technology .
so , what exactly is seti ?
here is the worry : making superintelligent a.i. is a really hard challenge .
now , it could happen much , much later , or sooner , the truth is nobody really knows .
the most important health challenges today are not caused by simple mutations in our genome , but rather result from a complex and dynamic interplay between genetic variation , diet , microbes and parasites and our immune response .
and first of all , what do we even study ?
i photographed her before and after the birth of her beautiful baby girl , issa .
this is joyce who &apos;s — in this picture — 21 .
this is marla olmstead who did most of her work when she was three years old .
but i want to begin with a story of an unusual and terrible man .
but you really for the most part can &apos;t tell the difference between a healthy person and a sick person — except in some of these special cases .
so if i zoom into that picture , i can just show you what it means .
okay . i can do also my shoulder . yeah ?
so this is a mental picture , i &apos;m describing a mental , vivid picture that enables dancers to make choices for themselves about what to make .
the west has given debt forgiveness programs which have halved sub-saharan debt from about 70 percent of gdp down to about 40 .
if you look at the red line here , what you &apos;re going to see is that in 1975 , just nine percent of kids were in secondary school education in sub-saharan africa .
we didn &apos;t invent anything new .
that &apos;s a small trunk !
it redefines the role of skin , and our bodies become an atomizer .
or the way that we attract sexual partners ?
massimo tamburini .
and from that point on , from my age at the time , i began to think of things in a different way .
i grew up in a tofu factory in seattle .
and — anyone remember this workbook , &quot; &quot; instant activities for your apple &quot; &quot; — free poster in each book ?
and so , sometime ago , i got this idea for a camera system .
another thing all these molecules are telling us that , apparently , bioluminescence has evolved at least 40 times , maybe as many as 50 separate times in evolutionary history , which is a clear indication of how spectacularly important this trait is for survival .
other people talked about bacterial communication .
people have found the collective as the slime mold finds the oats .
we think of a bunch of rednecks , quote , unquote , with guns .
this kind of arkansas , tennessee , oklahoma , west virginia region .
and my hope is , if we can turn biology and medicine from these high-risk endeavors that are governed by chance and luck , and make them things that we win by skill and hard work , then that would be a great advance .
now , if you just take baby diaper polymer and dump it on the brain , obviously , it &apos;s going to sit there on top .
so i &apos;m looking , really , for a mentor , because i just had my birthday .
but as a fine-art photographer i somehow felt that it wouldn &apos;t catch on out there , that there would be a problem with trying to make this as a fine-art career .
to make things more complicated , our software is getting more powerful , but it &apos;s also getting less transparent and more complex .
the head of google &apos;s ai systems called it , &quot; the unreasonable effectiveness of data . &quot;
you may have seen this anecdote that was printed in forbes magazine where target sent a flyer to this 15-year-old girl with advertisements and coupons for baby bottles and diapers and cribs two weeks before she told her parents that she was pregnant .
so what i want to talk to you about today is some of these things that we &apos;re able to do , and then give us some ideas of how we might go forward to move some control back into the hands of users .
but having committed to the process , i continued on , and something really surprising came out of this .
now in hindsight , it was actually good for some things , like mixing a can of paint or shaking a polaroid , but at the time this was really doomsday .
some people go to baseball stadiums to look at games ; i go and see design relationships .
you &apos;ve captured it for a moment , and finding this little still life &apos;s like listening to little songs or something : it gives me an enormous amount of pleasure .
he &apos;d already smuggled vitamin c into the camp , and now he managed to get hold of supplies of marmite on the black market .
he doesn &apos;t know how to cure it .
what happens in the after independence ?
and he said , &quot; &quot; doesn &apos;t matter if a cat is white or black , as long as it catches mice . &quot; &quot; because catching mice is what the two cats wanted to do .
they need different ways of being approached , different ways of being enfranchised , different ways of being skilled .
you know , when i went back in december of 2001 , i had absolutely no desire to work with the afghan government because i &apos;d lived as a nationalist .
now , this is kind of interesting , because it tells you that you should be looking for a particular fact , which is this : nothing in the world smells like rotten eggs except s-h , ok ?
