Speaker Annotated TED talks dataset (v-0.9.0)
==================================================

This is an official release of the SATED dataset, proposed in [this ACL2018 paper](link_to_paper). It consists of TED talks ([https://www.ted.com/talks]), annotated with their author and title.

The current release contains 3 subfolders for each language pair, `en-de`, `en-fr` and `en-es`. Each of those contains the three splits `train`, `dev` and `test` of the data used in the original paper. The data has been lowercased and tokenized using the [moses tokenizer](https://github.com/moses-smt/mosesdecoder/blob/master/scripts/tokenizer/tokenizer.perl).
