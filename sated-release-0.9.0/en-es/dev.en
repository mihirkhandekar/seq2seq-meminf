so nowadays , everyone could produce his mono product .
i &apos;m a multitasking person , and i push my students to fly through a very creative , multitasking design process .
he came up to me afterwards , he said , &quot; &quot; man , that &apos;s a fabulous story .
so at my school , we subsidize a gourmet lunch program for welfare mothers in the middle of the inner city because we &apos;ve discovered that it &apos;s good for their stomachs , but it &apos;s better for their heads .
and more than half of the increase has been in the last 19 years .
they &apos;re not under any illusions about what &apos;s happening .
and what went wrong ?
it looks like this is the leading edge in terms of rehabilitation .
it must have been a very unusual day for him .
around the same time , i met like-minded individuals who call themselves urban explorers , adventurers , spelunkers , guerrilla historians , etc .
the record on post-conflict recovery is not very impressive .
these are not environments where you can build export manufacturing .
even if you know what your aim is , think of ideas as freely as if you were throwing darts with your eyes closed .
the point is to gather random words , not information from the category you &apos;re thinking for .
the thing that is exciting was , in 1976 , i suddenly got interested in the human-powered airplane because i &apos;d made a made a loan to a friend of 100,000 dollars , or i guaranteed the money at the bank .
the green line goes down . that &apos;s the wild nature portion .
and now , i need to choose a sperm donor . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) i looked at this woman in shock .
but what you are buying now is great . &quot; &quot; now , the majority of manya &apos;s customers who came back the next day bought that other car , the car they did not need , the car that cost far too much money .
and that was that she did two entire shows promoting that movie &quot; &quot; the secret . &quot; &quot; do you guys know about that movie &quot; &quot; the secret &quot; &quot; ?
♫ sobule : take it , julia . ♫ sweeney : okay . oprah was never necessarily a big hero of mine .
you will feel loved and appreciated like never before and reconnect with friends and acquaintances you haven &apos;t heard from in years .
so the next time you &apos;re faced with something that &apos;s unexpected , unwanted and uncertain , consider that it just may be a gift .
and the future , for them , doesn &apos;t look particularly promising — in fact , it &apos;s downright bleak .
your debt fattens the profit of the student loan industry .
all of this information is relatively available .
it &apos;s incredible that we actually lived through all that .
i &apos;d like to convince you that the universe has a soundtrack and that soundtrack is played on space itself , because space can wobble like a drum .
if we run the movie of our universe backwards , we know that there was a big bang in our past , and we might even hear the cacophonous sound of it , but was our big bang the only big bang ?
this is harriet beecher stowe .
some of them were held by white hands , others by black hands .
we are , however , the measurers of many things .
earlier , i was going to say into the depths of the atlantic , but we don &apos;t have to go too deep to reach the unknown .
and there was something about this place , i didn &apos;t know why , that just felt special .
( applause )
the novel is very good at describing how jealousy trains us to look with intensity but not accuracy .
the novel is very good on this point .
my brother and i were living in new york city when the artists christo and jeanne-claude did their temporary installation , the gates , in central park .
let &apos;s take a closer look .
and a lot of it is because women are not able , are not free , to show their face to their self .
and i have done this throughout my work .
let &apos;s do a rotation by a third of a turn anticlockwise , and reflect in the line through x.
for example , what if i turn the starfish by a sixth of a turn , and then a third of a turn ?
so you can eat the same amount of food , but you ’ ll be getting fewer calories because the food is less dense in calories .
what was the biggest selling drug of all time when it was introduced a few years ago ?
&quot; &quot; doaa , do you know what happened to my brother ?
later that day , she looked up into the sky with hope , because she saw two planes crossing in the sky .
we all started as novices .
we &apos;re going to do working memory today .
and so with this solution , what does this mean for the world ?
so when someone actually goes on a plane , they could be sick and they could actually be in this latency period in which they could actually have the disease but not exhibit any symptoms , and they could , in turn , spread the disease to many other people in the cabin .
beijerinck and his kind provide an important lesson for the next generation of explorers — people like that young girl from beloit , wisconsin .
but as they become more and more accurate , we &apos;ve determined that this information is a form of life , or at least some of it is a form of life .
the ball is driven by three special wheels that allow rezero to move into any direction and also move around his own axis at the same time .
and of course , who wouldn &apos;t like to take a ride on one of these .
thanks .
it creates people — when you manipulate incentives to get people to do the right thing — it creates people who are addicted to incentives .
for an example , the core of tps , toyota production system , lies in heijunka , which is making manufacturing of different models of cars on a single assembly line .
so we benchmarked the toyota production system known for its quality and efficiency for the process of forest-making .
politics is about choices , and within those choices , politics is about priorities .
generally a duty of care arises when one individual or a group of individuals undertakes an activity which has the potential to cause harm to another , either physically , mentally or economically .
and you can start iterating the design .
and in fact , because we can create spare parts with things the machines are quite literally making themselves .
and the question still remains : what can individuals , organizations and governments do ?
so today it might just be the nsa and gchq , but who &apos;s to say that the chinese can &apos;t find that backdoor ?
and this trend of people using this communication network to help each other out goes far beyond the original idea of just keeping up with family and friends .
probably the most important third-party development came from a little company in virginia called summize .
in fact , it &apos;s much less transmissible than viruses such as flu or measles .
yet for the last year , it has been ebola that has stolen all of the headlines and the fear .
now , the human has a whole other way to rise to the top , and that is a prestige route , which is freely conferred .
absent from this list , and absent from any discussions of happiness , are happiness in another &apos;s happiness .
how could i have been so blind ?
it sent me over mass . ave . , massachusetts avenue , the shortest route from boston to cambridge .
( applause )
here is my best physical therapist completely failing to encourage the rat to take a single step , whereas the same rat , five minutes earlier , walked beautifully on the treadmill .
circles split in half and rotated , and mythology .
so , complexity . now , how many here are jugglers ?
and then i met yoyo , who is the native rapa nui-an guide , and if you look at yoyo &apos;s face , you kind of figure out where they got it .
and you know , when i was at microsoft , that was so engrossing , and the whole industry was expanding so much , that it did tend to crowd out most of the other things in my life .
somewhat like the curving of the universe .
therefore every moment really is the most important moment that &apos;s ever happened , including this moment right now .
mike matas : and so throughout the whole book , al gore will walk you through and explain the photos .
mm : it starts playing immediately .
so this is combining the federal level , which is the largest , the state level and the local level .
and finally , we need to really reward politicians .
and then there are the colors in the clouds of hail forming , the greens and the turquoise blues .
we are a small fishing tribe situated on the southeastern tip of long island near the town of southampton in new york .
we are literally a teeming ecosystem of microorganisms .
and that comes back to the diabetes story i was telling you .
so we &apos;re seeing there &apos;s a real extension of middle age .
but my most important question was always the same .
and that is my third and final wish for you at the ted conference .
anyway , so i &apos;d like your help in getting that signed up .
today we don &apos;t need one million light bulbs to create a spherical display .
and so we can control that with micro-controllers and create a fully volumetric , three-dimensional display with just 256 leds .
they signed for a whole collection of different reasons .
i just said it because it sounded right .
life was pretty good .
we grew up , and we grew older .
again , throwing light , then the third one .
but a solution arrived after being quiet and not working for about six , seven months , in the restroom , when i was changing the air freshener that goes from solid substance to vapor .
it &apos;s not clear , by the way , since then , whether that is an accurate generalization , but the data at the time seemed to support that .
now , the cartoon is not such an exaggeration , because studies of identical twins who were separated at birth and then tested in adulthood show that they have astonishing similarities .
it &apos;s about training the future health care providers correctly .
i was trained to be prepared in a medical emergency .
but the big innovation is still ahead , and you &apos;re working on it now . tell us about this .
em : i don &apos;t know , actually .
it will be completely free , and it will work in any browser .
let &apos;s set it to something else .
what have i heard during these last four days ?
they all come down to the idea of an expectation of something good that is due to happen .
well , in baseball , you play to win .
so we need a new model .
but amira also has no hope of resettlement to a third country , because that &apos;s a lottery ticket only available to less than one percent of the world &apos;s refugees .
and the results of that are extraordinary both for refugees and the host community .
my subject today is learning .
much of what a pregnant woman encounters in her daily life — the air she breathes , the food and drink she consumes , the chemicals she &apos;s exposed to , even the emotions she feels — are shared in some fashion with her fetus .
look at what this does . this is a simple piece of behavioral economics .
that &apos;s the argument i want to make tonight .
thank you all very much .
at nih , we have started this new national center for advancing translational sciences .
but a better way is to , what i call proactionary principle , which is : you engage with technology .
but when the scarcity came when the highs and lows and the droughts came , then people went into starvation .
some climbers had come by and looked at him , and he heard them say , &quot; &quot; he &apos;s dead . &quot; &quot; but beck wasn &apos;t dead ; he heard that , but he was completely unable to move .
at that point , he asked to be paged into his wife .
one side note on the collection of brains : because of the way that we collect , and because we require consent , we actually have a lot more male brains than female brains .
there &apos;s a container underneath that &apos;s collecting that tissue .
well , as a social scientist , this is the most amazing thing i have ever even dreamed of . now , i can look at all those words that used to , for millennia , disappear .
thank you so much for your time , and good luck with your record . ( applause )
can you agree on anything ? &quot; &quot; well , we can , and it &apos;s not difficult , because we have the same goal .
last year , with the help of the bill and melinda gates foundation , three and a half million farmers grew sub1 rice .
and we know the solar output &apos;s not constant through time .
we drilled through a hundred meters of floating ice shelf then through 900 meters of water and then 1,300 meters into the sea floor .
well , here &apos;s one thing he would have noticed , and by the way , there was a person who actually did this .
now there &apos;s a difficulty with proceeding in that way , which is that christianity is extremely , even on that list , it &apos;s an extremely specific tradition .
the p , the first one in &quot; &quot; hippo , &quot; &quot; is for pollution .
the hippo juggernaut we have created , if unabated , is destined — according to the best estimates of ongoing biodiversity research — to reduce half of earth &apos;s still surviving animal and plant species to extinction or critical endangerment by the end of the century .
and one of the molecules i study is called isoprene , which is here . it &apos;s a small organic molecule . you &apos;ve probably never heard of it .
i recently joined a field campaign in malaysia . there are others .
around that time i met an extraordinary human being , peter thum , who inspired me with his actions .
and in the process , i became the first person in history to make the entire 650-mile journey , from hercules inlet to south pole , solely on feet , without skis .
we cannot only have grateful experiences .
but think again .
we all understand why we have elections , and we all leave the house on the same day to go and vote .
we have to trust a lot of procedures .
we have an annual gathering of people , and that is called life in space .
of course the political agendas in the world has been very obsessed , polarizing the two against each other into different , very normative ideas .
now , the rate is still too high — still too many people unnecessarily losing their lives .
the only thing singing today would be the facts , for i have truly embraced by inner nerd .
a lot of people are excited when sharks actually went under the golden gate bridge .
technology has come of age that &apos;s allowing us to see the earth from space and go deep into the seas remotely .
i met kuwait &apos;s answer to bridget jones .
( laughter ) and i read about an orgy in a tree in angola .
and so i suddenly realized two very simple things : first , the widowhood effect was not restricted to husbands and wives .
and that , in fact , if we really want to understand human emotions , we need to think about them in this way .
the only abrupt worldwide change would have been major asteroid impacts or volcanic super-eruptions .
through a small telescope , this would look quite blank , but you see here hundreds of little , faint smudges .
now , let &apos;s try that again .
yet you had something inside your pocket .
there &apos;s an interesting marketing lesson from it , which is basically , when you market a product , you can either say , this is going to be wonderful , it will make you feel better and enliven you .
here &apos;s the architecture machine group , the predecessor of the media lab , in 1981 .
so they went back , and they thought about it .
and that is actually how great ideas often happen ; they fade into view over long periods of time .
i think philosophically , that was one of the most important papers that we &apos;ve ever done because it showed how dynamic life was .
it also is the first species to have its own website encoded in its genetic code .
too many other smart people out there . so .
and without giving you too much of a tirade , i want to talk to you about an invention i brought with me today : my 44th invention . no , that &apos;s not true either .
dh : right now ?
what are the dates again ?
for one thing , it often happens spontaneously , intuitively , accidentally or incidentally .
here is a letter of friendly advice .
and i think what that does to us psychologically is it creates an equation .
and norway , sweden , denmark and finland now rank among the top six most competitive nations on earth , and they work the kind of hours that would make the average american weep with envy .
it &apos;s part of our dna as humans , and maybe it &apos;s time our healthcare system — doctors , patients , insurance companies , us , started accounting for the power of that hope .
there &apos;s another drug out there .
you gotta love the aussies , right ?
see , i told you this is the really juicy stuff .
and these types of technologies , i see , have the potential to transform the face of hunger and nutrition , malnutrition out on the front lines .
food is gold there .
this whale pump , as it &apos;s called , actually brings essential limiting nutrients from the depths to the surface waters where they stimulate the growth of phytoplankton , which forms the base of all marine food chains .
today , they number in the hundreds , and they &apos;re endangered .
i &apos;m curious about how things work and how they are made , but also because i believe we should have a deeper understanding of the components that make up our world , and right now , we don &apos;t know enough about these high-tech composites our future will be made of .
two of the known applications for this material include interior design and multi-touch systems .
so here is the tiny creature .
it &apos;s sort of an alternative universe .
however , the moral and political choice is still up to us , as citizens and as voters .
and so they &apos;ll both underinvest because everyone &apos;s going to move out .
i left san francisco , where i live , on monday , and i was getting on the plane for this conference .
but that one word made a really big difference .
and you see , it stops growing .
well i don &apos;t have time to tell you about all the mathematics , but underlying this is the social networks , because this is a universal phenomenon .
we transform the universe into something much more rich and beautiful than it is today .
you see the red glow in their eyes , which is the reflection of the flashlight .
( laughter ) but you &apos;re beginning to see what can be done .
this is the size of the earth going through that same — ( laughter ) — frame . and to make it really clear , i &apos;ve put all four on one graph .
and on the photograph , he wrote with a flourish , &quot; to horse face , with love from geoffrey dickens , m.p. &quot;
they don &apos;t . nobody knows what it is .
but even beyond that , coming back to the internet , what you can actually see is that certain governments have mastered the use of cyberspace for propaganda purposes . right ?
the moment you put something critical in a blog , even if you manage to ban it immediately , it will still spread around thousands and thousands of other blogs .
but oh , her soap !
she wouldn &apos;t have wanted me to , i would think .
it says exactly the same thing : poor kids lose ground in the summertime .
this year , there are going to be millions of our children that we &apos;re going to needlessly lose , that we could — right now , we could save them all .
now , bad weather comes in , just land , fold up the wings , drive home .
within the light sport aircraft category .
and making your ideas accessible is not the same as dumbing it down .
five years ago , i experienced a bit of what it must have been like to be alice in wonderland .
now , i don &apos;t want to ignore the other side of what happens in our universe , like many of our scientists have .
and sometimes you &apos;re equipped with skills , but they may not be the kind of skills that enable creativity .
and i watched those constellations shift , hoping that they would part and i would see her face .
that this old man would interrupt his moonlight stroll with his sweetheart with the precise reason of making fun of a child .
and we take advantage of something that is very simple .
which means that all the devices that you &apos;ve seen before and all the formats , in principle , can be implanted and disappear .
when romo wakes up , he &apos;s in creature mode .
so we were talking before about telepresence , and this is a really cool example .
i hope you will go out and make personal health happen for yourselves and for everyone . thanks so much .
this is the kidney transplant i was never supposed to have .
as artificial intelligence evolves , so does his intelligence .
so , we &apos;ve made 20 robots in the last eight years , during the course of getting my ph.d.
let me tell you just one or two stories that deal with massive bubbles .
17th of may , 2013 , just two weeks ago , we identified that the u.s. stock market was on an unsustainable path and we released this on our website on the 21st of may that there will be a change of regime .
it &apos;s also about environment and respect .
he screeched that he would block the financing .
but i think there &apos;s a greater story here still .
what would you do then ?
there is no textbooks , i mean , not yet , anyway .
you can add them to all the squares of paul klee .
we should use machines that bring our work back into the world .
mg : thanks so much , i appreciate that .
the musician or musicians are invited to walk onto the stage with a stopwatch and open the score , which was actually purchased by the museum of modern art — the score , that is .
every language communicates with pitch to varying degrees , whether it &apos;s mandarin chinese , where a shift in melodic inflection gives the same phonetic syllable an entirely different meaning , to a language like english , where a raised pitch at the end of a sentence ...
but i want her to know that this world is made out of sugar .
and when they finally hand you heartache , when they slip war and hatred under your door and offer you handouts on street-corners of cynicism and defeat , you tell them that they really ought to meet your mother .
this is a song that i wrote about the meaning of technology , which goes perfectly with this gathering .
i wish i had that when i was in college .
i thought so .
it &apos;s a study at harvard where , at the end of the study , they &apos;re going to take my entire genomic sequence , all of my medical information , and my identity , and they &apos;re going to post it online for everyone to see .
every day , 24 hours , that pump is at your side , administering medicine directly to your heart , and it &apos;s not a particularly preferable medicine in many senses .
within a few days , i could walk again .
and , closer to home , chalua , an n.g. road in bangalore .
in 2008 , cyclone nargis devastated myanmar .
he actually was the first person to clone a dog , which is a very difficult thing to do , because dog genomes are very plastic .
i &apos;d like it to have the head of a dachshund , the body of a retriever , maybe some pink fur , and let &apos;s make it glow in the dark &quot; &quot; ?
they didn &apos;t bring much back : 841 pounds of old rocks , and something all 24 later emphasized — a new sense of the smallness and the fragility of our common home .
since 1970 , no human beings have been back to the moon .
and you guys can download it today if you want to run your own experiments to see if this would work .
imagine that you &apos;re in your lab — you &apos;re a scientist , you &apos;re not like me — you &apos;re a scientist , and you &apos;ve developed a new compound that you think might be therapeutic for somebody with cancer .
and i fell into those thousands of connections that i &apos;d made , and i asked my crowd to catch me .
( applause ) and you can see how many people it is .
yeah , look at this . you know , all kinds of different ...
bf : i &apos;m going to run up behind him .
he &apos;s 47 years old , slim , spiky hair , describes himself on twitter as &quot; &quot; movies , tv , technology , tacos . &quot; &quot; and roy price has a very responsible job , because it &apos;s his responsibility to pick the shows , the original content that amazon is going to make .
now , the question of course is , what happened here ?
and this enabled us to do a really interesting kind of analysis , because it allowed us to compare the predictions of people , say , 18 years old , to the reports of people who were 28 , and to do that kind of analysis throughout the lifespan .
everybody here holds all of them , but you probably know that as you grow , as you age , the balance of these values shifts .
this is a video chat application .
so to explore this idea , i built an army of small robots , and each of these robots has what are called omni wheels .
the key is , how do you put all of the others ?
to understand the role of these genes is going to be well within reach .
so the idea is : how to integrate these flows in space , over time and with the limited means you have .
and look at these images .
and the marrow miner , the way it works is shown here .
no robots required .
well , of course , i went to the theater to see the play .
what makes this dynamic inconsistency happen ?
the other problem with commitment devices is that you can always weasel your way out of them .
but aren &apos;t there things that we believe and don &apos;t believe at the same time ?
( applause ) so , what excites me about cymatics ?
as the frequencies increase , so do the complexities of the patterns that appear on the plate .
mr : this is a robot version of my beloved spouse , bina .
thank you so much .
some of the unscrupulous dealers were running away with peoples &apos; bitcoin before they &apos;d mailed the drugs out .
so if you &apos;re clever , you can try and work out who &apos;s behind them .
well , let &apos;s start with faron young — who was born incidentally in 1932 .
and then — ( laughter ) three paragraphs later we get this little beauty : &quot; &quot; we went back to blair house to look at the speech for the last time .
now we thought , now what could be going on here ?
what are they doing ? and there was a cue that was available to us .
most people would say for a lot , a lot of money .
what they figured out was that there was not enough effort involved .
i want you to look at the author &apos;s book and say , &quot; &quot; wow ! i need to read that . &quot; &quot; david sedaris is one of my favorite writers , and the title essay in this collection is about his trip to a nudist colony .
but not too long ago , i came upon this on the web .
how do we get out ?
&quot; &quot; guys , and woman , you &apos;ve given enough .
i mean , you didn &apos;t want this thing clogging up a light socket .
and they didn &apos;t know how far they would really have to go , and they overloaded the horses with hundreds and hundreds of pounds of stuff .
but again , those rewards could be calibrated so precisely if we were able to use the vast expertise of gaming systems to just jack up that appeal , to take the data , to take the observations , of millions of human hours and plow that feedback into increasing engagement .
simple game quest .
( applause ) thank you . i am still waiting for a call from the mta . ( laughter ) you know , i &apos;m actually not even using more colors than they use .
so i get the book by this person , and i start reading it , and i &apos;m thinking , this guy is not who he says he is ; he &apos;s a fraud .
the excitement of a great orchestra performance comes from the attempt to have a collective of musicians producing one unified whole concept .
( music ) ( applause ) thank you .
one way to think of it is that we &apos;re highly optimized for risk decisions that are endemic to living in small family groups in the east african highlands in 100,000 b.c.
most of the time , feeling and reality are the same .
if you &apos;re trying to crispr a genome , the first thing that you have to do is damage the dna .
so you can change a letter , you can take letters out , but most importantly , you can stuff new dna in , kind of like a trojan horse .
i remember bringing them all to my favorite corner table , and i read poems paired to songs like food to wine , paired , i can tell you , like saddle shoes to a cobalt blue vintage cotton dress .
it was fun . that was pretty much it .
it &apos;s a continuous journey .
thank you very much .
for all the disaster , there is an opportunity here to build better houses for the next generation , so that when the next earthquake hits , it is a disaster — but not a tragedy .
chileans have been building with confined masonry for decades .
so this person , who used to be the center of attention in every family gathering , was suddenly hiding behind people .
break them , boil them down into much smaller problems , and then find simple solutions for them .
and the way you should do that is study the furniture , let it marinate in your mind , distract yourself , and then a few days later , go with your gut , because unconsciously you &apos;ve figured it out .
they go through life like sailboats tacking into the wind — wanting to get close to people , but not really having the models of how to do that .
but it all revolved around that original definition of success .
he had the qualifications .
also , three guys working for years in los angeles , an iranian , a palestinian and an egyptian , created the aptly named axis of evil comedy act .
sadly , this leads me to another three bs that represents how the media in the west talks about us as bombers , billionaires and belly dancers .
we actually self-interrupt every three-and-a-half minutes .
the net hours that would have never existed , had couchsurfing not existed .
so keep that in mind .
i authored this answer , and a few others .
so with all this success , why isn &apos;t that good enough , you might ask .
it &apos;s not hardware .
what did this team look like ?
and just like that , another of their decisions was to keep me and my siblings connected to our roots .
and so one of the consequences of that , i believe , is that where we have this sort of spectrum of media right now — tv , film , video — that basically becomes one media platform .
and all these things that are going to be on this are not just pages , they are things .
you don &apos;t need the 30-day waiting period .
and when i have no more love left , i just drink milk , because that &apos;s where love comes from . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) and one night my daughter eden came to me .
in fact , my colleague , june cohen , has taken to calling it &quot; &quot; radical openness , &quot; &quot; because it works for us each time .
and , very happily , there &apos;s one class of people who really can &apos;t make use of this tool .
and what we see is that for coastal tags , for those organisms that live near the shoreline , they &apos;re most diverse in the tropics .
one would send out sound waves that would bounce back .
so paralysis is a consequence of having too many choices .
they actually make us worse off .
he &apos;s now going to use the other thing which is essential , and that &apos;s his voice .
female voice : why don &apos;t you try saying something encouraging to cheer milo up .
what is extreme poverty ?
importantly , realistic delivery also includes finance , a way to pay .
nt : tell me , what will man do when the forests disappear , and the coal deposits are exhausted ?
nt : they wouldn &apos;t give me the money .
( applause )
thank you .
and yet , nobody listened to them .
this has been done by an incredible , principled effort by the international community , and , of course , above all , by bosnians themselves .
i created a company in america called gonofone , which in bengali means &quot; &quot; people &apos;s phone . &quot; &quot; and angel investors in america put in money into that .
so i started looking for any evidence that — does connectivity really increase productivity ?
well , there &apos;s a self-fulfilling prophecy .
and so what i want to do with you in , oh god , only 10 minutes , is to really think again this juxtaposition , because it actually has massive , massive implications beyond innovation policy , which just happens to be the area that i often talk with with policymakers .
or just to really prove a point , we can launch programs like my personal favorite , the windows calculator .
i was relatively inhibited compared to the cybercriminals , who wouldn &apos;t be so concerned by law , and here you can see my mobile device .
we brought this raw data in and we filtered it .
so as a naive new zealander i thought , well i &apos;ll go to the pentagon .
when i examine the very strong low-frequency regions , or bass line — i &apos;m zooming into the bass line now .
if people with disabilities are allowed into the scientific field , an explosion , a huge titanic burst of knowledge will take place , i am sure .
what could terrorists do today with the technologies available that we have ?
some can be armed with hd cameras and do countersurveillance on protesters , or , as in this little bit of movie magic , quadcopters can be loaded with firearms and automatic weapons .
given this rare opportunity to start fresh , they chose liberal arts as the most compelling model because of its historic commitment to furthering its students &apos; broadest intellectual , and deepest ethical potential .
and the point is not to treat these topics as topics of study , but as frameworks of action .
and many times i don &apos;t see africans working with them .
they said this is about proliferating and sharing ideas .
but if you look really closely at this diagram , you &apos;ll see something that doesn &apos;t make a lot of sense .
but what &apos;s interesting is that the fluid and the waste from inside the brain , they don &apos;t just percolate their way randomly out to these pools of csf .
this is coal , the most common source of electricity on the planet , and there &apos;s enough energy in this coal to light this bulb for more than a year .
ordinary homeowners and renters have saved more than 250 million dollars on their energy bills , and we &apos;re just getting started .
and this . ( laughter )
i have a whole global governance sermon that i will spare you right now , because i don &apos;t think that &apos;s going to be enough anyway , although it &apos;s essential .
but they had not had any time to evacuate any belongings .
before i could turn around , everyone on the tracks was screaming and running .
how many of you here see dolphins ? raise your hand if you see dolphins . ok , those people who raised their hands , afterwards , the rest of the audience , go talk to them , all right ? actually , this is the best example of priming by experience that i know .
to do it in a pleasant way , in a very primal way , so i can make the audience here happy .
in 2009 , an fbi informant who had fled pakistan on murder charges led four men in a plot to bomb synagogues in the bronx .
so initially it was al qaeda plots , and now the islamic state is the current flavor .
and the answer is , what is missing ?
( video ) nicholas negroponte : can we switch to the video disc , which is in play mode ?
so this is our guess as to what this baseline of average happiness arguably looks like throughout life .
av : yes , and i often joke with rufus when he comes home that i &apos;m not sure he would actually be able to find our child in a line-up amongst other babies .
a very extreme culture .
from everything from a weird hotel lobby , to saran wrap placed over your window , to this moment where i had my road in front of my house paved dark black , and this white moth was sitting there dying in the sun .
( music ) so this is about potty training — as most of you , i hope , know .
you can draw , as everyone should .
but the monkey gradually developed a strategy .
it represents the change in a reliable way of the responses of tens of millions , possibly hundreds of millions of neurons in your brain .
this is what we have , the philosophy we have to change to .
( applause ) life is too complex for a software program .
but when we went to speak with her , when we took this photograph , the slaveholders were still menacing us from the sidelines . they hadn &apos;t been really pushed back .
it &apos;s about helping people to build lives of dignity , stability , economic autonomy , citizenship .
but i was told this was the story of human beings , despite the fact that it only had two women in it .
( applause )
it turned into a 24-hour contest .
renny gleeson : you just ... no , he &apos;s not okay .
the final missing piece , the real paradigm-buster , is this : a gas station on orbit .
go , go , go .
you then hope that the earth moves in such a way as to bring the bones back up to the surface .
today , we &apos;ve got great technology : we have gps .
it &apos;s associated with the concept of paradox of choice .
( applause ) so esther , when you were watching helen &apos;s talk , was there any part of it that resonated with you through the lens of your own work that you &apos;d like to comment on ?
things like the corporate social responsibility programs , albeit small in scale , are moving in that right direction .
in order to think about that framing , we have to ask ourselves , how does capitalism work today ?
and he had to start a harsh course of chemotherapy .
to ruminate means to chew over .
at 74 years old , became mayor because something had to be done to protect the ocean .
the death rate in these dolphins , for the first calf born of every female dolphin , is 60 to 80 percent .
indeed , one of the advantages that the americans will have in terms of power in asia is all those countries want an american insurance policy against the rise of china .
is this just a game that diplomats and academics play ?
slaves were legal things .
they &apos;re all legal things .
a conductive pen from the lewis lab at uiuc .
adding some intelligence with a microcontroller .
this was the ice age .
i study some of the oldest art in the world .
like i said , shanghai and copenhagen are both port cities , but in copenhagen the water has gotten so clean that you can actually swim in it .
and quite often we sit in a design meeting and we discover that there is this great idea .
intelligence is a matter of information processing in physical systems .
it &apos;s really a failure to detect a certain kind of danger .
it &apos;s that you need to go to a place that &apos;s a desert today , a place that doesn &apos;t have too many plants covering up the rocks , and a place where erosion is always exposing new bones at the surface .
that &apos;s the magic of the geological record .
( laughter ) it &apos;s ideas , it &apos;s innovation , it &apos;s technology that will end the age of oil , long before we run out of oil .
thank you very much .
this is one of the very few viruses in the world where there are big enough cracks in its armor that we can try to do something truly extraordinary .
let &apos;s settle for control — that &apos;s good enough . &quot; &quot; now as seductive as the idea of control sounds , it &apos;s a false premise .
and here is the crucial thing .
but now , the fact that it &apos;s also a good explanation , hard to vary , makes the crucial difference .
it &apos;s great . lots of no is released .
but certainly in people older than my wife , this appears to be a more marked effect .
because we do live in a world where shamans still sing to the spirits of the jungle , where rivers do boil and where legends do come to life .
intense .
in fact , nasa has shown a lot of this is out there .
to put it in context for myself : i was born in 1946 .
bonobos are , together with chimpanzees , your living closest relative .
and so , my fellow primates , let us embrace this gift from evolution and play together , as we rediscover creativity , fellowship and wonder .
and she was going along the tracks , and the tracks split .
we &apos;re removing the cancer cells , but we &apos;re revealing the previous damage that the body has tried to fix .
now let me just put this in context to close .
see if you can guess .
you want to express the bribe , the command , the promise , the solicitation and so on , but you also have to negotiate and maintain the kind of relationship you have with the other person .
on the other hand , if you extend the bribe , if the officer is dishonest , you get a huge payoff of going free .
almost a million people showed up , and people were so energized and excited by what had taken place , they went back to their own communities and started their own political and social organizations , further increasing the visibility of the movement .
and others resented this comparison between gay rights and civil rights , and once again , the sinking feeling that two minority groups of which i &apos;m both a part of were competing with each other instead of supporting each other overwhelmed and , frankly , pissed me off .
robust systems are also fault tolerant and fail-safe .
( applause )
so this is how this scheme would look .
nature works very differently .
so , tiny , tiny , tiny solutions that made a huge amount of impact .
and i think that &apos;s what this is very much about .
i hope that you will find it as fascinating to read about traditional societies as i found it to live in those societies .
another change for the better is that we now have specialized retirement facilities and programs to take care of old people .
and we also use functional mri , called fmri , to take a video , a movie , of brain activity when participants are taking part in some kind of task like thinking or feeling or perceiving something .
so this is a model of the human brain , and this is prefrontal cortex , right at the front .
so now at harlem hospital center when patients come in with an elevated body mass index , the electronic medical record automatically generates a prescription for health leads .
but the real issue is there &apos;s no food at home .
they have eritreans .
( laughter ) no , listen to this . it &apos;s interesting .
it leaks . it &apos;s struck by lightning .
so there &apos;s always a big question that comes up , because plastic in the ocean has got a really bad reputation right now , and so we &apos;ve been thinking cradle to cradle .
( applause ) and greatly as i admire the achievements of professional designers , which have been extraordinary and immense , i also believe that design benefits hugely from the originality , the lateral thinking and the resourcefulness of its rebels and renegades .
the nightingale ward , as it is called , dominated hospital design for decades to come , and elements of it are still used today .
and this is a little-known technological fact about the internet , but the internet is actually made up of words and enthusiasm .
the book-shaped dictionary is not going to be the only shape dictionaries come in . and it &apos;s not going to be the prototype for the shapes dictionaries come in .
and he had to close his eyes , it &apos;s so disgusting , and the smell and everything .
another three years .
i thought , &quot; &quot; i could be khaled . &quot; &quot; i could not sleep that night , and i decided to do something .
i decided to go silent , completely silent .
approximate collection rate of 11 sheep per hour , which would make a working wage of 69 cents per hour .
so i &apos;m going to show you a few of the projects that i &apos;ve been working on over the last couple years that reflect on our lives and our systems .
the two human dna sequences go back to a common ancestor quite recently .
and then these earlier forms of humans disappear , but they live on a little bit today in some of us — in that people outside of africa have two and a half percent of their dna from neanderthals , and people in melanesia actually have an additional five percent approximately from the denisovans .
we can do it by talking to each other ; we can do it through video ; we can do it through the written word .
they kiss ; they embrace ; they hold hands .
and i think all of you can agree that if you can figure out how to improve life by a factor of 20 , you &apos;ve probably improved your lifestyle by a lot , say your salary , you &apos;d notice , or your kids , you &apos;d notice .
so , without this technology you can &apos;t see the stars .
he did it by creating a movement .
this method — mass marketing — requires average ideas , because you &apos;re going to the masses , and plenty of ads .
and she describes to me the feeling she felt as a five-year-old standing in that exact spot .
recently , on one trip , we were walking , and she stops dead in her tracks , and she points to a red awning of the doll store that she loved when she was little on our earlier trips .
but i mean , like — really , who does this ? right ?
is it going to add local services like shops to the neighborhood that local people would like to use ?
as a result , autism became a source of shame and stigma for families , and two generations of autistic children were shipped off to institutions for their own good , becoming invisible to the world at large .
lorna wing was a cognitive psychologist in london who thought that kanner &apos;s theory of refrigerator parenting were &quot; &quot; bloody stupid , &quot; &quot; as she told me .
and we just did a little intervention .
and when you choose to view stress in this way , you &apos;re not just getting better at stress , you &apos;re actually making a pretty profound statement .
jared ficklin : thank you . ( applause ) there are 1,400 stars .
there &apos;s no closed captioning for the ted theme song , and we &apos;re missing it , but if you &apos;ve watched enough of these , you hear it in your mind &apos;s ear , and then applause starts .
i know the ropes now , know what the tricks are .
they could have put them all out in view .
since it &apos;s organic , i &apos;m really keen to try and minimize the addition of any chemicals .
but with synthetic biology , we can actually imagine engineering this bacterium to produce something that gives us the quality , quantity and shape of material that we desire .
ca : and in the last year , tell us one hopeful thing that you &apos;ve seen happening .
she takes that money and finds single mothers in her community to send back to school .
a professional psychic who speaks to dead people , she can &apos;t reach me ?
now , without that , how could we possibly function ? ( laughter ) she gives you the names of previous lives , who you were in previous lives .
it was evident when i would ask my 13-year-old , &quot; &quot; young man , where do you see yourself in five years ? &quot; &quot; and his response : &quot; i don &apos;t know if i &apos;m gonna live that long . &quot;
that means everyone in here , and those who are watching the screen .
but the great change came , of course , with globalization and deregulation .
this is an organization that can raise money across border .
of course , the details of policy are going to be different , because the challenge is different .
and so , what the countries of the bottom billion need is very strong checks and balances .
enzymes help this take place .
here is my perfect example of the counterintuitiveness of the quantum world .
i was raised with a very heavy sense of unfinished legacy .
she was talking about board meetings , she was founding peace organizations , she was coordinating carpools , she was consoling friends — all these daily acts of care and creativity .
but now , as we prepare to talk , we understand how little we know .
i cannot do that unless i send the signals that i will be open to listen to the other side &apos;s signals .
there &apos;s so much life in this cave , and i can &apos;t even begin to scratch the surface of it with you .
so i have a really cool day job — i get to do some really amazing stuff .
and now we use johnson &apos;s no more tears , which we probably should &apos;ve been using right from the very beginning . ( laughter ) but the key to that is by looking at the difference between perceived danger and actual danger , where is the real risk ?
and then eventually the russians reach in , drag you out , plunk you into a chair , and you can now look back at what was an incredible experience .
and that spark that you &apos;ve been hearing about all day today , you can use that spark that you have within you and turn it into a fire .
change.org is an online petition-sharing platform where you can create a petition and share it across all of these social media networks , through facebook , through twitter , through youtube , through reddit , through tumblr , through whatever you can think of .
in the old days they used to take a lump of pentelic marble and drill from the surface in order to identify the skin , the appearance , what aristotle defined as the distinction between substance and appearance , the thing that makes things visible , but here we &apos;re working from the other side .
when they appear close to the edge , they are representations , representations in which the viewers have become the viewed .
but what if , even after a 100-kilometer tunnel or a 500-kilometer tunnel or a 10,000-kilometer collider floating in space between the earth and the moon , we still find no new particles ?
it &apos;s 10 to the minus 39 .
it &apos;s in that context that i work .
and therefore she starts normalizing this exploitation .
they have launched a divestment campaign that has now convinced , i think , 55 universities in 22 states to divest their holdings of stocks with regard to companies doing business in sudan .
it &apos;s diverse . it &apos;s got a lot of different approaches .
but i did feel that i spent so much time learning this language , why do i only promote with it ?
which , when you actually have to design a beethoven poster , comes in handy , because the visual information of the logo and the actual poster is exactly the same .
the new machine age can be dated to a day 15 years ago when garry kasparov , the world chess champion , played deep blue , a supercomputer .
it &apos;s growing faster than it did during the second industrial revolution .
let &apos;s start at the beginning .
you can either take the blue pill and stick to your comforting delusions , or you can take the red pill , learn some moral psychology and step outside the moral matrix .
it only started with the birth of modern bureaucracy , and of industrial revolution .
companies blocking access to im or to facebook .
and i &apos;d really love to show you my week &apos;s worth of outfits right now .
but before i show you what i &apos;ve got inside , i &apos;m going to make a very public confession , and that is , i &apos;m outfit-obsessed .
we need to continue mounting pressure on phone companies to change their sourcing processes .
recent uk legislation could be used in the same way .
we learn , as children , that you get closer to something that &apos;s hot , and it burns you . it &apos;s a very powerful bit of learning , and it happens pretty early on .
and would you be able to , kind of , draw a — you don &apos;t have to draw the diagram , but would you be able to draw the diagram , if you had to do it ? or would you just say , that &apos;s actually not possible ?
now here is what happened to this person who eventually became mayor of san francisco .
you &apos;re hearing one presentation after another , often representing a group of people , a tribe , about how they have changed the world .
in plain english , that means censorship and surveillance of their users .
as riadh guerfali , the veteran digital activist from tunisia , remarked over this incident , &quot; &quot; before , things were simple : you had the good guys on one side and the bad guys on the other .
thank you very much .
what &apos;s the fastest growing threat to americans &apos; health ?
i &apos;d like some paper people .
so i thought i &apos;d start with a love poem about prime numbers .
now , batman i will accept .
how do you picture this theater ?
maybe then we &apos;d spend less time worrying about serial killers and plane crashes , and more time concerned with the subtler and slower disasters we face : the silent buildup of plaque in our arteries , the gradual changes in our climate .
the same incredible imaginations that produced &quot; &quot; the origin of species , &quot; &quot; &quot; jane eyre &quot; and &quot; the remembrance of things past , &quot; also generated intense worries that haunted the adult lives of charles darwin , charlotte brontĂŤ and marcel proust .
it was about inspiration and determination and never giving up on my interest for science and learning and growing .
now you might wonder how a 13 year-old girl could come up with this idea .
they had killed many men , raped many women .
they were mostly women and children , and many of them were hacked to death .
that was our task .
that &apos;s our average budget .
this is the allen telescope array electronics today .
and yet we &apos;re spending billions of swiss francs on this problem .
we &apos;re going to explain that right now .
and so there is an increase in people having to have their fillings replaced .
that &apos;s the kind of machine that makes energy .
it &apos;s going to work .
i started thinking about the relationship between communication , media and collective action when i wrote &quot; &quot; smart mobs , &quot; &quot; and i found that when i finished the book , i kept thinking about it .
and i don &apos;t have enough time to talk about all of them , but think about self-interest .
he &apos;s about four or five times as fast with this simple little performance metric .
for 20 years , my goal was to let somebody &#91; be &#93; able to use their elbow and hand in an intuitive way and at the same time .
i found my new passion and the urban environment was my playground .
but if you think about it , what would happen if you put those things down ?
and that &apos;s when the emails started pouring in , sometimes as many as a thousand a day .
every school holiday spent back in the village with my grandmother made me consciously aware of the inequalities this incredible opportunity had created within my own family .
they &apos;re like a snapshot in time .
and it &apos;s looking around , and when it finds something , and recognizes it being foreign , it will actually engulf it and eat it .
so , one of the things that we use a lot to recognize people will never be written in the genome .
so in the first approximation , if i can list the number of atoms that compose a human being , i can build it .
that means that in terms of biomass , insects are more abundant than we are , and we &apos;re not on a planet of men , but we &apos;re on a planet of insects .
we &apos;re even doing this on purpose .
well , it helps us to connect with our cultural and our natural heritage .
and this is compounded by the issue that the landscapes that define our natural heritage and fuel our aquifer for our drinking water have been deemed as scary and dangerous and spooky .
and he learned meticulously from his mistakes .
they were responding to immediate concerns .
we have to be willing to do more .
i &apos;d like to try something new .
and it &apos;s specifically algorithms , which are basically the math that computers use to decide stuff .
they acquire the sensibility of truth because they repeat over and over again , and they ossify and calcify , and they become real .
in the 18th century , it became a verb , and it meant to swindle or ridicule or to make fun of someone .
the incredible contribution of the doodle is that it engages all four learning modalities simultaneously with the possibility of an emotional experience .
s ( yelling more loudly ) : i want to change my life !
is english a tsunami , washing away other languages ?
and bob epstein raised a hand . he stood up .
i &apos;m really afraid , because i think the kinds of changes we can reasonably expect from individuals are going to be clearly not enough .
you might say , &quot; &quot; well there &apos;s nothing there to be living , &quot; &quot; but that &apos;s not right .
unlike the low entropy of the early universe , even though we don &apos;t know the answer for this , we at least have a good theory that can explain it , if that theory is right , and that &apos;s the theory of dark energy .
but next to the dead duck is a live duck , and please pay attention .
this is a moose .
it &apos;s called the basket cell .
we &apos;re going to do exactly what we outlined in the previous slide .
so i was a really terrible student when i was a kid .
it &apos;s easy enough to say that the world shapes our maps of the world , right ?
people watch it all over the country also in public places .
and she &apos;s out there .
he started this with no money .
the revenues increase at a higher level , giving us a healthy margin while you &apos;re treating a large number of people for free .
and we didn &apos;t know if rita existed or if it was a fake name .
and that goes for every single person in this room .
( applause ) diane hamill metzger : number 005634 .
gotta have hope i &apos;ll be free someday .
a drug for the heart can get metabolized in the liver , and some of the byproducts may be stored in the fat .
generating tissues of predictable density and behavior is the second piece , and will be really key towards getting these models to be adopted for drug discovery .
they &apos;re toxic to most animals , but not to monarchs .
they get sick like you . they get sick like me .
there &apos;s the real world , the world that we all share , and there &apos;s the world in my mind , and the world in my mind is often so much more real than the real world .
this gives me so much energy , and i &apos;ve got to have an outlet for all that energy .
it &apos;s called pleaching , or grafting trees together , or grafting inosculate matter into one contiguous , vascular system .
and you can have a hundred million of these homes , and it &apos;s great because they suck carbon .
and most importantly , when you put big kids together with little kids , you get the big fat white guy out of the middle , which is cool , and you create this kind of accountability amongst peers , which is incredible .
so here in new york , i urge you , my fellow americans , to help us make america great again .
we think about pie charts and column graphs and endless politicians talking to scientists wearing cardigans .
it reflects our decisions as individuals , as governments and as industries .
i &apos;m sitting on a train .
if you actually think , you remove the myth and there is still something wonderful .
my brothers and sisters have moved on .
my father was a government worker .
the technology — the internet — that has broken the business model is allowing us to reinvent journalism itself .
thank you .
imagine what that means to our life support system .
the next 10 years may be the most important , and the next 10,000 years the best chance our species will have to protect what remains of the natural systems that give us life .
tr : so you &apos;re 86 percent accurate right now ?
takes about $ 300 , by the way , in the neurologist &apos;s clinic to do it .
and the &quot; &quot; a students &quot; &quot; get the tougher curriculum , the best teachers , etc .
and i tend to think of it like my shadow .
but this is how i do work . i do take pieces and bits and look at it and struggle with it and cut it away .
if any of you guys have any ideas for it , please contact me .
but after some time , after some months , one day as i was going out and about , suddenly i noticed hundreds of dragonflies , hundreds of dragonflies .
it &apos;s about five kilometers around , counting the dragonflies as i go , trying not to bump into people as i &apos;m looking in the trees .
today , she &apos;s only 16 years old and she has three children .
when i compared the two stories between me and my sister , i said , &quot; &quot; why can &apos;t i do something ?
yb : thank you .
he came up with our name and logo . we &apos;re mission motors .
so , here &apos;s one . there &apos;s another one which i studied .
so , traffic keeps flowing , so that means less braking , which means less accelerating , less gas and less pollution , less time wasted , and that partly accounts for europe &apos;s better efficiency than we have in the united states .
and just to think of one or two people out of africa who are just really inspiring .
and the other problems — in not only africa , but the rest of the developing world and , indeed , everywhere — what are we doing to our planet ?
freeways .
and it took 25 years until another city ...
the philosopher arthur schopenhauer said that those who don &apos;t wonder about the contingency of their existence , of the contingency of the world &apos;s existence , are mentally deficient .
that tells us what naked reality really is , that reveals what i call taufotu , the true and ultimate furniture of the universe .
and if you could reach into a box at random and pull out something that squeaks , maybe everything in the box squeaks .
things are going wrong for him .
i come from norway ; all our heroes are explorers , and they deserve to be .
both are necessary , but it can be too much of a good thing .
the key is a set of molecules known as sirna .
actually , we can turn off a gene .
the first dog is the first to go , and he is contemplating an aspect of his relationship to his owner , and the title is &quot; &quot; a dog on his master . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as young as i look , i am growing older faster than he .
while you slept , i watched you breathe as the moon rose in the sky .
who better to solve these liminal problems than those who have faced their whole lives at the intersections .
women of color in stem occupy some of the toughest and most exciting sociotechnological issues of our time .
thank you . i have to tell you i &apos;m both challenged and excited .
let me tell you what they are . first one : certainty .
so you want to go to that board meeting , but you only want to pay attention to the bits that interest you .
i love this .
so would i take the pill ? in an instant .
sitting on my bed , i rocked back and forth , moaning in fear and isolation . &quot; &quot; this episode led to my first hospitalization in america .
only 15 percent of this 100 percent goes to the plant . eighty-five percent is lost .
and because in order to get 15 percent of it to the plant , all the rest is lost , we have to add more and more .
i mean , did a designer come up with that ?
he had a dixieland jazz band when we were growing up , and he would always cover louis armstrong tunes .
let me tell you why this is so important .
the good news is that the scientists who &apos;ve been studying motivation have given us this new approach .
and part of the challenge of the ceo is to find connections across areas , and so you might look in r &amp; d , and here you see one person who crosses the two areas of interest , and it &apos;s a person important to engage .
it &apos;s like , yes , i can be free .
everything is not predictable : the stock market is , at least for me , not predictable , but most complicated negotiations are predictable .
when people say to you , &quot; that &apos;s impossible , &quot; you say back to them , &quot; &quot; when you say &apos; that &apos;s impossible , &apos; you &apos;re confused with , &apos; i don &apos;t know how to do it . &apos; &quot; &quot; thank you .
sometimes , of course , being compassionate can produce feelings within us that are very difficult to control .
the only trouble is the people next door ; i can &apos;t stand them . &quot; &quot; this , in a way , is one of the challenges of how to interpret a really good idea .
galileo , by the way , did this very cleverly by running a ball backwards down the strings of his lute .
the best a.i. in the planet would find it complex and confusing , and my little dog watson would find it simple and understandable but would miss the point .
we have a growing user base of this , and we network domes .
the digital universe is the basis of our space show productions that we do — our main space shows in the dome .
and they start to see others doing it , and saying , &quot; wow , i want to do that with my own money . &quot;
now it looks like it &apos;ll just keep growing in size in the years ahead .
rabin &apos;s statement was a reflection of decades of security and intelligence collaboration between the two , which in turn was born out of perception of common threats .
the easiest target was the peace process , and now the iranian ideological bark was to be accompanied by a nonconventional bite , and iran began supporting extensively palestinian islamist groups that it previously had shunned .
nothing interests us more than other people .
well , for want of a better definition , it &apos;s a city in which the car is an optional instrument of freedom , rather than a prosthetic device .
and so that sets up for making access to get goods and services more convenient and less costly in many cases than owning them .
and so it &apos;s not only an option for them , but i believe it &apos;s an imperative for zipcar and other mesh companies to actually just wow us , to be like a concierge service .
i assure you , this is very tiny . it &apos;s just six microns on a side .
well , so far only one connectome is known , that of this tiny worm .
so let us appeal to nature for inspiration .
mars is a destination , but it will not be our last .
so changing or eliminating a population is practical only if that species has a fast reproductive cycle , like insects or maybe small vertebrates like mice or fish .
but that just created another problem .
that &apos;s 38 stories tall .
there are four humans in this shot — one , two , three , four .
i remember in iraq , for example , that we went through a period of feeling that we should delay democracy .
politicians also need to learn , occasionally , to say that certain things that voters want , certain things that voters have been promised , may be things that we cannot deliver or perhaps that we feel we should not deliver .
if you go to the pentagon , they will say , &quot; &quot; you know what , now we really can put a bomb inside a pickle barrel at 20,000 ft . &quot; &quot; and you know what , it &apos;s true ; they actually can do that now .
it is this weapon of devastating accuracy and precision .
( applause )
tell your daughters of this year , how we woke needing coffee but discovered instead cadavers strewn about our morning papers , waterlogged facsimiles of our sisters , spouses , small children .
now , he actually told me that we would land on mars by 2025 , but elon musk is more optimistic than i am — and that &apos;s going a ways — so i &apos;m giving him a couple of years of slack .
how soon will the first humans actually land here ?
so please go back home , tell your kids to play more games , because that &apos;s what i need .
and then , of course , i get the whole data set from the lion .
and on guitar is my 14-year-old brother , tommy .
i &apos;m robbie mizzone . i &apos;m 13 , and i play the fiddle .
but many other cultures have their signature puzzles as well .
i &apos;ve been solving my whole life .
so , before i got here , i thought , &quot; &quot; you know , i am from north america .
we &apos;ll never know if this stuff worked . actually , i think the federal bureau of investigation took it down for security purposes , sometime in the early 1900s .
and yet , at home in the dark , back in my underwear , i could still hear their voices .
first , they took me to the offices of farrar , straus and giroux .
we thought very hard about how to present this unknown subject to a modern audience : the dark colors to set off the colors that remained in objects that were often faded ; the placing of lights to bring out the silk and the gold thread ; the labeling .
but it brought it alive to them . i think they suddenly saw that these weren &apos;t just old faded tapestries .
if i had a little extra money , i &apos;d buy a hostess fruit pie .
i &apos;ve built a career .
i like to think — thank you .
and i woke up from my visualization and i said , who was that ? i couldn &apos;t tell if it was shabana azmi or rekha , two very famous indian actresses , like the meryl streeps of india .
everything we blog , everything we tweet , and everything we click is a public act of making media .
it does not .
none of these studies found that people spend more on drinking or smoking or that people work less .
a sender can pay a 1.6 percent fee and with the click of a button send money directly to a recipient &apos;s account with no intermediaries .
and here , every media person had to be trained for hiv .
every ministry , even judges , had to be involved in aids education — everyone — and we said the public , institutions , religious institutions , schools — everyone was involved .
why should we , especially if you can afford it ?
what i have showed you here is only the species from africa , adansonia digitata .
it has to be , and now more than ever , with economic divisions growing wider every day .
and over that time , i &apos;ve seen a lot of crazy things in the markets , and i &apos;ve traded a lot of crazy manias .
and the problem is the following : knowledge that geo-engineering is possible makes the climate impacts look less fearsome , and that makes a weaker commitment to cutting emissions today .
and so people took him seriously when he said we should think about this , even though there will be some ozone impacts .
and you know what it was ? shakespeare . &quot; &quot; and he recited some to me .
and they &apos;ve all gone on to master &apos;s and ph.d. degrees in excellent places .
now this is a midi arrangement of rachmaninoff &apos;s prelude .
you would think that because these implants are optimized for speech , they were designed for speech .
and the source was a man , an african-american man , charming , rugged , homeless , playing a violin that only had two strings .
and i understood that this was the very essence of art .
if i squeeze the tip , they go from tip to base .
and you see things like this .
the piece of art you see on your left is painted by a western red cedar and that on your right by a douglas fir , and what i learned was that different species have different signatures , like a picasso versus a monet .
of the 100 incarcerated people that are released , 60 will return to prison .
and whewell not only coined the term scientist , as well as the words anode , cathode and ion , but spearheaded international big science with his global research on the tides .
and &quot; &quot; what proportion of the earth is covered in water ? &quot; &quot; once scientists became members of a professional group , they were slowly walled off from the rest of us .
who knew about extension managers ?
she &apos;s managed to save the prosciutto , but in the process she loses the tablecloth , which you can see flying away in the upper left-hand corner .
now it &apos;s time for full disclosure .
obviously there were characters like this .
paradoxically , it was the group who had posted similar information , an example of moral dissonance .
&#91; have you ever cheated in an exam ? &#93; now to one group of subjects , we told them , &quot; only other students will see your answers . &quot;
this was work from many people , but i &apos;m going to explain it through a confirmatory experiment that i did a few years ago .
that means that all of these cancers actually are the same cancer that arose once from one individual devil , that have broken free of that first devil &apos;s body and spread through the entire tasmanian devil population .
the workers still come the next day , they do their job , but they &apos;re following different instructions .
i have no idea what to do next .
you know we teach our kids and we buy them games , but why don &apos;t we get them games , if they &apos;re entrepreneurial kids , that kind of nurture the traits that you need to be entrepreneurs ?
get kids to stand up in front of groups and talk , even if it &apos;s just stand up in front of their friends and do plays and have speeches .
then where do you go ?
that &apos;s a key element of making that report card .
so imagine that the operators make their return by building a percentage markup into each transaction .
there &apos;s all sorts of organizations that can use these pools of very flexible people , possibly already once they &apos;ve been inducted .
and that will happen , paradoxically — everything you hear about global warming — when we hit co2 down to 10 parts per million , we are no longer going to have to have plants that are allowed to have any photosynthesis , and there go animals .
( laughter ) i mean , even the creationists give us 6,000 , but hollywood goes to the chase .
it goes hand in hand with doubt , in a never-ending conversation with it , and sometimes in conscious defiance of it .
he &apos;d call out terrorism for what it is , not only criminal but an obscene travesty of everything he believed in and struggled for .
they look really good , very nice movement , and also they appear to have some kind of behavior where they kind of circle around each other and follow each other , similar to what we &apos;ve seen before — but again , working with just primordial conditions , no pure chemicals .
these membranes are also quite similar , morphologically and functionally , to the membranes in your body , and we can use these , as they say , to form the body of our protocell .
the persistence , their ability to deal with ambiguity , their ability to tackle problems that they haven &apos;t seen before .
can we create a perfect society ?
like looking away if you look at it too long because it gets shy , or things like that .
and basically to ask the questions : what if art was aware that we were looking at it ?
now very recently , very recently , i &apos;m talking about last six , seven , eight months , water , methane , carbon dioxide have been detected in the spectrum of a planet outside the solar system .
and you might have seen the planet going into a star .
it seems the perfect medium to investigate magic and ask , why , in a technological age , we continue to have this magical sense of wonder .
the same thing happens when people watch magic tricks .
in october of 1979 , we shipped visicalc .
in fact , here &apos;s my calculator .
but still , there were all kinds of questions about — &quot; &quot; did you wear a hat ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how short was your skirt ? &quot; &quot; and one of the things — if you remember condoleezza rice was at some event and she wore boots , and she got criticized over that .
and so it was nice when one of them would show up .
so in a very typical , silly designer fashion , after years worth of work , pretty much all i have to show for it are the titles for the film .
in that year , what i did do a lot was look at all sorts of surveys , looking at a lot of data on this subject .
you might be wondering why i &apos;m wearing sunglasses , and one answer to that is , because i &apos;m here to talk about glamour .
god cannot be glamorous because god is omnipotent , omniscient — too far above us .
i &apos;m going to show a clip of one young lady .
medicine is doing a better job of keeping us alive .
jy : to better understand how this biodegradation works , we wanted to verify the catabolic pathways of our three strains .
right now , the ocean is actually a soup of plastic debris , and there &apos;s nowhere you can go in the ocean where you wouldn &apos;t be able to find plastic particles .
and the people on tv weren &apos;t telling us anything that we wanted to hear .
so , in b.i. , life was simple .
i created a book bank at the age of 11 .
dear friends , for centuries we were taught anger is bad .
and so i had these ideas in my head , that this is going to be great .
and they hadn &apos;t done anything because — kind of , like in car business , engineers are there to solve problems , and we were asking them to create a problem .
it &apos;s only possible because of the development of high-speed 3d printing that for the first time will make functional , usable modules that will go into it .
i never got to meet him .
and i came to the conclusion that we had built an incredible quality of life if you happen to be a car .
and so you see this culture starting to shift in oklahoma city .
i would never have thought of putting the charter online .
and it brings you into the presence of what &apos;s been called god , nirvana , rama , tao .
wernher von braun , in the aftermath of world war ii concluded , quote : &quot; &quot; science and religion are not antagonists .
and there &apos;s one that i want to talk about .
&#91; hawaiian chant &#93; when they finish , they sit in a circle and ask me to come to join them .
you cannot make the voyage alone , you were never meant to .
i found these rules out by comparing the statistics of four-word phrases that appear more often in the most favorite tedtalks as opposed to the least favorite tedtalks .
or are you going to go with a black version , which will allow you to create really bad tedtalks , mostly about blogs , politics and stuff ?
now you can just make a little network like this and fold them and stick them together and make an icosahedron .
it &apos;s like a centrifuge .
it &apos;s a terrible design strategy actually .
skill number one is the ability to recognize success and the ability to recognize failure .
this would be a normal wave pattern .
so , maps of things leading to organized understandings of the universe in which we emerge .
finally , the work ethic .
why ?
because it &apos;s not anymore mom , dad , the flowers and the bees , and then there &apos;s the baby . no , it can be two moms , three dads , in-vitro — there &apos;s the whole idea of how babies can be made today that has changed .
these three objects over there are hard drives with a bluetooth connection . but they &apos;re in reality very , very beautiful sculpted artifacts that contain the whole desktop and computer memory of somebody who passed away .
and this value is crucial .
thank you .
why were other people blocking it ?
how can we have world peace with different cultures , different languages ?
ks : so you see there , it didn &apos;t bounce back . now , this was an unintended side effect of some experiments they were doing .
now this is important for two reasons .
maybe it &apos;s not surprising that the journey for ella has had some big steps backwards as well as forwards .
it turns out that in britain today , most new jobs are not advertised .
i can digitize all these .
in my lab , we develop tools to travel not only in space but also through time .
so now my country is 15 trillion dollars in debt .
one idea is to drastically reduce public support for the arts .
so i went back there with a 28 mm lens .
and i would always leave that moment , and we would ask them , &quot; so can you tell me who is who ? &quot;
so we call it a relational universe .
there ’ s only where it is relative to everything else that is .
and it became ever clearer that economic growth doesn &apos;t automatically translate into social growth or human growth .
and what &apos;s striking though , is that in society there &apos;s almost nothing comparable , no comparable investment , no systematic experiment , in the things capitalism isn &apos;t very good at , like compassion , or empathy , or relationships or care .
that was the lowest turnout the city had seen in 100 years .
in the last year alone , 2013 , 6,000 people disappeared in the state of rio .
this solution has been called , by some , &quot; &quot; potentially the most important medical advance this century . &quot; &quot; now , the solution turned out to be simple .
that &apos;s been the discoveries of the last 2,000 years , that &apos;s mankind moving forward .
is this the right interpretation of evolutionary theory ?
they give you a survival advantage .
but there was still a problem .
as an african-american woman , she &apos;s twice as likely to have a premature birth or to have a stillbirth .
okay . i &apos;m going to tell you how that &apos;s possible .
okay , so these twin traditions are paralyzing us .
i &apos;m a professor .
what an intriguing group of individuals you are ...
cluster bombs are a world problem , as this munition keeps destroying and hurting whole communities for generations to come .
cluster bombs have reportedly been used most recently in the ongoing conflicts in yemen and syria .
so this came out in a scientific journal a few years ago , but more importantly , it was featured on &quot; &quot; csi : miami , &quot; &quot; so you really know it &apos;s true .
take the ancient egyptians , for example : very concerned about the body parts they thought they &apos;d need in the afterlife , but they left some parts out .
so every year , thousands of visitors come to tana toraja to see , as it were , this culture of death , and for many people these grandiose ceremonies and the length of the ceremonies are somehow incommensurable with the way that we face our own mortality in the west .
so after a person &apos;s physical death , their body is placed in a special room in the traditional residence , which is called the tongkonan .
this would result in a flood of x-rays that would spread out in a bubble along with exotic particles , plasma inside , centered on the pitcher &apos;s mound , and that would move away from the pitcher &apos;s mound slightly faster than the ball .
but using some of these same methods , we can look at the nsa &apos;s data centers , and figure out , you know , we don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on there , but it &apos;s pretty clear that their operation is not the size of google &apos;s .
so for instance , you can see that the scientific terms break down into two subcategories of the astronomic and the physics terms .
and this simple fact , that reading in between the lines , i could sense , through words , his feelings , was a simple , but very effective way to help .
she spent many excited days planning her tenth birthday , which of course none of us thought she would ever see .
it &apos;s pretty magical .
this is what an aura looks like .
and if we had a computer put into the body of a person who &apos;s at risk , we could know , before they even have symptoms , that they &apos;re having a heart attack , to save their life .
( applause ) you &apos;ve been a great audience .
actually , as soon as someone turns it on , i go into the other room and read .
sometimes they just have nothing to do with the facts .
the toy was an absolute flop , and it was almost completely forgotten by the end of the year , and what that means is that the billy possum didn &apos;t even make it to christmastime , which when you think about it is a special sort of tragedy for a toy .
saturn is accompanied by a very large and diverse collection of moons .
( applause ) .
and as you get a little bit closer , it starts looking like lots of pipes , like maybe a chemical plant , or a refinery , or maybe a hellish freeway interchange .
and that &apos;s gone up since then , but we don &apos;t have the numbers yet .
and it would change as the colony gets larger .
so it has to know the difference between a forager and a nest maintenance worker .
and he plays it , and he loses , and he plays it , and he loses , and he plays it , and he loses , and arthur samuel has created a machine that surpasses his ability in a task that he taught it .
maybe , if we aggregated the data , maybe we could identify telltale signs that best predict that a car accident is going to take place in the next five seconds .
this rectilinear form is an ancient tomb that is previously unknown and unexcavated , and you all are the first people to see it in thousands of years .
the great pyramid of giza was built one stone at a time with 2.3 million blocks , with incredible bureaucratic efficiency .
companies are the makers of their fortunes , and like all of us , they are utterly exposed to serendipity .
or as the ballet dancer alonzo king said , &quot; what &apos;s interesting about you is you . &quot;
but we &apos;re humans — we &apos;re terrestrial mammals .
so , how do i study this ?
and that job is that they go around and pick up syringes from the back of hospitals , wash them , and in the course of this , obviously picking them up they injure themselves .
and they are collected en mass — you can see the scale of it here — and sorted out , by hand , back into the right sizes , and then put back out on the street .
we want to say the same thing 10 , 20 , 30 years from now : look what we &apos;ve done over the last 30 years .
their mother &apos;s still alive , it would make her upset .
what i really enjoyed about this project is reviving these people &apos;s words .
she wrote this poem when she was 18 years old in 1888 , and i look at it as kind of a very sweet feminist manifesto tinged with a little bit of defiance and a little bit of resignation and regret .
i &apos;d like to begin with a thought experiment .
so imagine a monkey sitting at a keyboard .
to go into those spaces where the magic is happening .
we got a couple of hands .
but if we as educators leave behind this simple role as disseminators of content and embrace a new paradigm as cultivators of curiosity and inquiry , we just might bring a little bit more meaning to their school day , and spark their imagination .
rule number two : embrace the mess .
i was torn between mathematics and media .
and then curtis cooper got it back .
so that haunting story has led me to my job .
they believed that every case of ghosts that they had investigated so far had been explained away by science .
jake : hey guys .
now a fourth factor really becomes an obsession , which is , never betray the illusion .
and the water at the north pole is minus 1.7 .
he also told me about the great explorers .
that &apos;s all . a school dropout saw your problem in the society of not using sanitary pad .
i don &apos;t even use that cloth to clean my two-wheeler .
there &apos;s over three million amputees every year who need a new or replacement knee .
the other thing we did is that we smoothed the profile .
and i have no trouble imagining that after spending weeks or even months as a second-grade citizen , living on the streets or in a horrible makeshift camp with a stupid , racist name like &quot; &quot; the jungle , &quot; &quot; most of us would be willing to do just about anything .
and by the end of september , he was living on the streets somewhere in france .
now , the africa progress panel , led by kofi annan , they &apos;ve calculated that congo may have lost more than 1.3 billion dollars from these deals .
( applause )
he made a lot of really interesting cultural references .
and i guess the one variable that i haven &apos;t considered is the competition .
what did we do ? what was the mistake that was made ?
and that brings me to the reason that i &apos;m here .
( laughter ) and that — ( applause ) — in the depths of a very severe economic recession , i think that there &apos;s a really important lesson there , that if you can remember your international obligations whilst you are trying to rebuild your own economy , that &apos;s really something .
the politicians that we elect and the politicians we don &apos;t elect , on the whole , have minds that microscope .
and i looked at her , i remember that day , and i saw something beyond what i was seeing in angeline .
i learned that she did not have to be abused because she is a woman .
this was once a park .
a group of men march through the streets cutting themselves with knives .
my talk is &quot; &quot; flapping birds and space telescopes . &quot; &quot; and you would think that should have nothing to do with one another , but i hope by the end of these 18 minutes , you &apos;ll see a little bit of a relation .
now the first step , pretty easy .
it &apos;s a decimal machine . everything &apos;s done in decimal .
the project has a number of parts to it .
at 25 , emma came to my office because she was , in her words , having an identity crisis .
i pushed back .
thank you .
and i study that in the natural world , the interconnectedness of species .
i was a silent , invisible observer of how people behaved when they thought no one was watching .
i was shocked , but as i thought about what she had said , i was filled with enormous compassion and love for my mother , yet i could do nothing about it .
russian nuclear launch key : the one on the top is the picture of the one i found on ebay ; the one on the bottom is the one i made for myself , because i couldn &apos;t afford the one on ebay .
it would seem that the object of desire only comes into its own by disappearing repeatedly .
these distractions were actually grists to their creative mill .
of course , i think any of us , in any remotely similar situation , would feel the same way , we &apos;d have the same instinct .
when my schedule ends , mira briefly shows me how i progressed throughout my session .
when i was growing up , i really liked playing hide-and-seek a lot .
i think that &apos;s a big , big problem .
but this is the equivalent of three libraries of congress — burnt down , forever lost — each year .
one billion people .
( applause ) and it &apos;s counterintuitive , but the cost of energy expended for the flight is only two cents of a dollar today , and we &apos;re just at the beginning of this .
but as a scientist , i &apos;m interested in a different problem of other minds , and that is the one i &apos;m going to introduce to you today .
child : his was on the grass .
maybe he &apos;s worried that he &apos;s going bald . ( laughter ) this ability to focus our attention on something other than the present is really amazing . it allows us to learn and plan and reason in ways that no other species of animal can .
so , people want a lot of things out of life , but i think , more than anything else , they want happiness .
and yet we &apos;re meant to be educating them for it .
we walked in this room and it was full of people like me .
we &apos;ve been neighbors for a very long time .
the alpha male wound up being ejected from his own family .
for example , i wish i hadn &apos;t worked so hard .
here &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do .
mega agricultural operations often are responsible for poisoning our waterways and our land , and it produces this incredibly unhealthy product that costs us billions in healthcare and lost productivity .
so i want everyone to understand the critical importance of shifting charity into enterprise .
i will not let silence wrap itself around my indecision .
it is feeling your flaws gut-wrench guillotine your tongue .
so they began to work on that .
it can be incremental , or it can be breakthrough .
so thank you very much .
what is he doing ?
so thank you very much .
i developed a detector that replaces the current detectors that homeland security has .
yeah , i &apos;ve really enjoyed actually exploring the world more , doing more of the crazy things like you saw in the video .
this project has lasted now , been just over two years .
to keep safe in my work , i try not to take bookings from someone who calls me from a withheld number .
these laws have political support precisely because they target people that voters don &apos;t want to see or know about .
there literally are only a handful of equations that you need to simulate the activity of the neocortex .
but , for the first time , we can actually address this , with brain simulation , and ask very systematic and rigorous questions , whether this theory could possibly be true .
( laughter ) ( applause ) i keep thinking of warren buffet waking up one day and finding out he has 30 billion dollars more than he thought he had .
so there &apos;s a place for music and literature , etc . , but also for grammar .
he wouldn &apos;t tell me what happened .
so it &apos;s a totally different picture .
and there , in baltimore and oregon and appalachia , find new purpose , as he did .
in the mini-mart , all those years earlier , not just two men , but two americas collided .
the encyclopedia is just one in a long line of arabic erotica , much of it written by religious scholars .
and so women and their relatives will go to great lengths to preserve this tiny piece of anatomy — from female genital mutilation , to virginity testing , to hymen repair surgery .
over the past few years , we have made dramatic breakthroughs .
over coming years , they &apos;re going to conduct our audits , and they &apos;re going to read boilerplate from legal contracts .
these rapid collapses are especially likely where there &apos;s a mismatch between available resources and resource consumption , or a mismatch between economic outlays and economic potential .
but there were also plenty of places in the world where societies have been developing for thousands of years without any sign of a major collapse , such as japan , java , tonga and tikopea . so evidently , societies in some areas are more fragile than in other areas .
but whatever direction the music took , one thing until recently was always the same , and that was when the musicians stopped playing , the music stopped .
it &apos;s just a design of pitches and silence and time .
perhaps reason is overrated .
centuries ago , our ancestors would burn cats alive as a form of popular entertainment .
it &apos;s the females , i think , that lay the eggs , and then the males fertilize them .
( applause ) thank you . ( applause )
i &apos;m not bragging about how much we fund ; it &apos;s how little anyone else actually pays attention to aging and funds innovation on aging , chronic disease management and independent living in the home .
how do we collect not just biological data but behavioral data , psychological data , relational data , in and on and around the home ?
but she was really amazed .
it was willful blindness .
this was not a devastating stroke , but it did affect his speaking and so forth .
and she stonewalled me . it was unbelievable .
but you open one of the garage doors and there is a professional-size boxing ring inside .
on the outside it looks like a very typical garage , a nice garage .
and on the bottom-left is a thermal camera .
so here you &apos;ll see , on the top right , what the robot sees with the camera .
but i had another idea about this map .
and so when it became time for me to do my graduate studies , i studied this emerging field of landscape ecology .
and this is important stuff .
today , our culture is flourishing .
one day they &apos;ll get here .
when i got out i had a choice .
porous , nonporous .
and it &apos;s not just water that this works with .
that &apos;s nice .
if you &apos;re able to view a structure from the inside , then you really learn something about it .
and i did everything i could for each and every patient of mine .
but there were daunting challenges .
if i remove the blockage , the video will restart .
this means we need to use existing infrastructure as much as possible .
really ? is this going to matter in 50 or 100 years ? okay , that was kind of cool . ( laughter )
they &apos;ve overtaken the u.s. as the world &apos;s biggest car market , they &apos;ve overtaken germany as the largest exporter , and they &apos;ve started doing dna tests on kids to choose their careers .
still in his mid-50s , he suffered severe osteoarthritis .
the house belonged to the zacchini family , who were something like american circus royalty .
you begin drowning in worries about dangers that aren &apos;t present .
more recently , we &apos;ve tried therapy dogs , wilderness retreats — many things which may temporarily relieve stress , but which don &apos;t actually eliminate ptsd symptoms over the long term .
so i want to tell you a little bit about both of those in the next few moments .
you get multiple sclerosis .
oh my god .
but imagine if this woman wasn &apos;t aware of what fgm was , if they never had that conversation ?
chuck had managed to get his warrant lifted and he was on a payment plan for the court fees and he was driving tim to school in his girlfriend &apos;s car .
finally , near the end of this season , the judge on this assault case threw out most of the charges and chuck came home with only a few hundred dollars &apos; worth of court fees hanging over his head .
and eventually someone referred me to a homeless health clinic .
i was as smelly and as depressed as anyone in line .
the dry air is really good for telescopes , and also , the cloud cover is below the summit of these mountains so that the telescopes have about 300 days of clear skies .
and i was struck by the juxtaposition of these two enormous disciplines that humanity has .
these are ways of doing self-organization — of doing entrepreneurship — that are gentle , that are egalitarian .
and this blew his mind . literally . he checked into a sanitarium . ( laughter ) and when he came out of the sanitarium , he was convinced that he had been put on earth to found transfinite set theory because the largest set of infinity would be god himself .
it &apos;s my way of helping other victims , and it &apos;s my final request of you .
and still we ask , why doesn &apos;t she just leave ?
today , erick has built a business that generates several million dollars of revenue , and he employs 70 people full time and another 800 people during the season when the bats drop their droppings the most .
i graduated from high school in zimbabwe and i went off to college .
so certainly , the physicians of today , including myself , are completely reliable on these devices .
let &apos;s get personal . i won &apos;t ask who here &apos;s had a colonoscopy , but if you &apos;re over age 50 , it &apos;s time for your screening colonoscopy .
could we do this all in real time ?
i was in the third year of my seven-year undergraduate degree .
i was to be strawberry mansion &apos;s fourth principal in four years .
( laughter ) they ask , and i answer each question honestly , and this exchange in listening helps to clear up any misconceptions .
the next morning , we climbed out of the cave and hiked all the way to the top of the glacier , where we finally rigged and rappelled this pit for the very first time .
when you think of a cave , most of you think of a tunnel going through solid rock , and in fact , that &apos;s how most caves are .
i &apos;m gonna sing this song , just to inspire you how this woman has made a difference .
and so i made a commitment . i say , &quot; i &apos;m gonna not eat my breakfast . &quot;
and to participate , for a mutant , there is a minimum of exercise , a minimum of sport .
you must go back to fight , to battle .
we &apos;ve only just begun exploring other possible uses for this new technology .
mary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as snow , and everywhere that mary went , the lamb was sure to go .
you will know what this person is doing , whether happy , sad , old , young — a huge amount of information .
and in effect , what we have is some sort of stick in one hand attached to a robot , and they &apos;re going to move that back and forward .
they are rating even financial products like the infamous mortgage-backed securities .
these are indicators that give you a much better read about the socioeconomic development of a country .
three , pressing unresolved environmental concerns .
and four , a global recession that has fundamentally shocked consumer behaviors .
( applause )
now , malaria is an incredibly complicated disease .
the ku klux klan is an ngo .
now , why did the world bank not let me do this work ?
not exclusive to these things , but in addition to them , is propagating a genuine demand for democracy on the ground .
at the age of 22 , i was co-founding this organization in denmark .
so we were able to control for gender , age , income , education , even basic personality variables , and the result stays the same .
you could probably see it in the audience members when i showed you those disgusting images .
it &apos;s very exciting to think where we get to go with this .
and we can make those markers glow .
who is everybody ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everybody . &quot; &quot; they said , &quot; &quot; syria ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syria . &quot; &quot; &quot; lebanon ? &quot; &quot; lebanon . &quot;
and we took these messages and we made posters out of it , because i know people : they don &apos;t read , they see images .
and not all these moves were voluntary .
look at some of the major latitudinal transgressions : people from high uv areas going to low uv and vice versa .
now , the diagram that you see here , i know it looks like some kind of sports play , but it is actually a blueprint of the first bacterial program i developed .
we went on to show that this technology could sensitively and specifically detect liver cancer , one that is challenging to detect otherwise .
it just says &quot; &quot; money , &quot; &quot; and if you look down the side street , it says , &quot; &quot; does not make me happy . &quot; &quot; we had a show that just came down last week in new york .
they are commissioned .
so , we modified the optics of the camera in order to mimic the baby &apos;s visual acuity .
in fact , the story holds true even if you have a person who got sight after several years of deprivation .
that &apos;s from an exhibition that paola antonelli is organizing at moma later this year , during the summer .
and what we did there was actually use a new type of network at the time that had been deployed all across the world — that &apos;s a cellphone network — and use anonymous and aggregated information from that network , that &apos;s collected anyway by the operator , in order to understand how the city works .
i hit the dog anyways , and that sent the car into a fishtail , and then a spin across the freeway , until finally it wound up in the fast lane of the freeway faced backwards into oncoming traffic and then the engine died .
and finally , their amygdalas are larger than average as well , by about eight percent .
it took us two days just to organize the place , but hey , you know , we worked on it . does he look happy ?
and lots and lots of that little bit down there , sacrifice .
i thought some doctors would sign on and others wouldn &apos;t , but i had no idea of the huge backlash that would ensue .
i know this firsthand .
it &apos;s ephemeral just like us . &quot; &quot; upon educating myself a little further about plastics , i actually realized this was a bad thing .
it &apos;s a bad thing that plastic breaks down into smaller little bits , because it &apos;s always still plastic .
( applause ) ladies and gentlemen , that &apos;s just about it from me .
it &apos;s a frightening piece of equipment for the novice stunt performer , because it will break your legs very , very quickly if you land on it wrong .
in the cities , a lot of the cost of property is actually wrapped up in its speculative value .
here &apos;s why .
well , these other lines include some real price increments and some forgery which i did .
( laughter ) there are thousands of books on that .
it took a long time , but eventually some of them began to write to their mothers , their friends , their girlfriends .
i also gave them the weekly assignment of writing a personal letter , to anybody .
and my friends from honduras asked me to say thank you , ted .
immediately after that vote , on february 21st to the 24th , a delegation of about 30 hondurans went to the two places in the world that are most interested in getting into the city building business .
people just use their cell phones to tweet .
they &apos;re almost like a national tv station .
he &apos;s 6 foot 9 .
he &apos;s a shepherd . he &apos;s spent his entire career using a sling to defend his flock against lions and wolves .
you should know , the clitoris of the pig is inside the vagina .
why don &apos;t you have the farmers do that ?
in africa , we say , &quot; &quot; if you want to go fast , you go alone , but if you want to go far , you go together . &quot; &quot; and i believe that social pan-africanism is how we can go far together .
before now , if you wanted to be heard by your possibly tyrannical government , you were pushed to protest , suffer the consequences and have your fingers crossed that some western paper somewhere might make someone care .
let &apos;s see what people — what would you say ?
and the point , the essential nature , of musical performance is to produce excellent music .
and instead of him saying , &quot; &quot; ok , evelyn , please , feet slightly apart , arms at a more-or-less 90 degree angle , sticks in a more-or-less v shape , keep this amount of space here , etc .
if i asked you to clap — maybe i can do this .
i lost my faith in our species .
i &#91; did &#93; a master &apos;s degree in economics .
let me describe five ways that this can be done .
well , let me describe some applications .
and it was quite wonderful , because i had an interest — an early interest — in theater , that &apos;s justified on this thing .
and i love this work , because i did these cartoonish clouds over manhattan for a period of two months .
and when i talk to judges around the united states , which i do all the time now , they all say the same thing , which is that we put dangerous people in jail , and we let non-dangerous , nonviolent people out .
they &apos;re like the baseball scouts 20 years ago who were using their instinct and their experience to try to decide what risk someone poses .
and if it goes horribly wrong , no worries .
if you have another 30 or 40 seconds , and you have another 30 or 40 seconds , and we just see that , i just think — i can feel it . we want to hear a little more .
here we are at the orbit of uranus .
spitzer &apos;s suggestion was we do this in space .
now , many of you may have noticed there &apos;s a problem at this point , and that is that it takes a long time to measure whether those outcomes have happened .
in britain , 63 percent of all men who come out of short sentences from prison re-offend again within a year .
really ? two hundred thousand years of human evolution , and it still can &apos;t tell the difference between a saber tooth tiger and 20 folksingers on a tuesday night open mic ?
it was so bad .
in non-professional circles outside america , it &apos;s largely ignored .
in most cases , people who out themselves will help to destroy the myth that there is something wrong with atheists .
and boy , did they print .
my grandfather was a coal miner .
just play your life with all you have , and share it with the world .
now , with my last piece , i &apos;d like to show you that classical music can be so much fun , exciting , and that it can rock you .
ts : so here are the — jh : all right , i &apos;ll get out of the way here .
i &apos;m left-handed , and so i draw .
on the distribution side , though , as a world , we have a lot of work to do .
so , two examples .
one night , she had a dream .
my father , who had fought in three wars , could not save his own sister from this suffering .
we &apos;re entering a second generation of no progress in terms of human flight in space . in fact , we &apos;ve regressed .
the most impressive airplane ever , i believe , was designed only a dozen years after the first operational jet .
repower america with 100 percent clean electricity within 10 years .
this is a completely unsustainable pattern .
how would we grow these cells ?
let &apos;s call it a million .
it &apos;s really any technology where we can measure the underlying information properties .
and we invite you to participate . thank you very much .
sensuous , aesthetic gratification , where in a moment , in an instant , we are rewarded for just being .
was this a good idea ?
and certainly consumer education works .
day five , they ran out of penicillin , and the poor man died .
i &apos;m very proud because i think i &apos;m the only person in america to out bible-talk a jehovah &apos;s witness .
that &apos;s how i hailed taxicabs .
he can place those exactly where he wants .
but what about expression ? what about that moment when an artist delivers that piece of work ? you know , do our technologies allow us to express ?
you can see multiple fibers coming out of the spinnerets , because each spinneret has many spigots on it .
spiders use silk for many purposes , including the trailing safety dragline , wrapping eggs for reproduction , protective retreats and catching prey .
so , please mix them .
touch me , feel — ah , ah , you know !
this is my submission for the l.a. museum of film .
this is a home-built rocket-propelled car . that &apos;s a 1953 henry j — i &apos;m a bug for authenticity — in a quiet neighborhood in toledo .
and these people , yes , they &apos;re tired , but they are not fatigued .
there are a lot of people out there who will survive and will thrive , in part because of what you do to help us beat ebola .
put another way , media is increasingly less just a source of information , and it is increasingly more a site of coordination , because groups that see or hear or watch or listen to something can now gather around and talk to each other as well .
media , the media landscape that we knew , as familiar as it was , as easy conceptually as it was to deal with the idea that professionals broadcast messages to amateurs , is increasingly slipping away .
two years ago , i have to say there was no problem .
it would have glittered in an interior , a little like a little firework .
now in the meantime , i have six friends who are waiting at the next six consecutive stops in their underwear as well .
and that was done also without permission , although no one seemed to care .
our existence has been co-opted , silenced and erased .
mom was a nurse &apos;s aid .
now , i want to tell you about a second epiphany that &apos;s related to that first one that i think can bring us progress , not just around the world , but right here at home .
it was a picture in the national geographic magazine of a kid who was my age in east africa , and there were flies on his face and a distended belly .
we call them petrodollars . the treasury was bursting with money .
when the commissioner of police comes on tv to talk about crime , he isn &apos;t speaking about corruption .
and she goes inside , and woman comes up to her and says , &quot; &quot; welcome to mothers2mothers .
so , i want to tell you a story — i want to take you on a little trip .
and a lot of people , especially in the art community , don &apos;t necessarily engage in science in this way .
and so i started doing this regularly .
i &apos;m a neuroscientist , a professor at the university of california .
and they all seemed to be ok .
then another character was a half-woman , half-cheetah — a little homage to my life as an athlete .
well , lucky for me , a lot of people answered that call .
that would keep it from forming the tangles that seem to kill large sections of the brain when they do .
and of course , when it comes to cognitive effects , &quot; &quot; use it or lose it &quot; &quot; applies , so you want to stay mentally stimulated .
i had never in my life ever tasted candy .
my name is joseph , a member of parliament in kenya .
it has no fresh water that it &apos;s able to drink , but it drinks water out of fog .
it &apos;s extremely inexpensive and rechargeable every five years .
but as a result of that , i &apos;m finding that there &apos;s not just room for my own artistic practice , there &apos;s room for a lot of other artistic practices .
so thinking about those things together feels right .
but what you want to know is who &apos;s top , don &apos;t you ? ( laughter ) i knew that , i knew that , i knew that .
further to the right is more .
i said , &quot; &quot; cancer &apos;s only one page in my life , and i will not allow this page to impact the rest of my life . &quot; &quot; i also declared to the world at large that i would ride it out , and i would not allow cancer to ride me .
but to go from where i was to where i wanted to be , i needed something .
when someone is in an extremely suicidal state , they are in a stage four medical health emergency .
it has taken me years to try to accept my son &apos;s legacy .
and a huge eruption of discussion around accessibility came , and we &apos;re really excited about that .
the materiality and fleshiness and meat of the mushroom being explored by how it can hold up different objects being stuck into it .
you know , when you want to forget , you don &apos;t want to see things , so you just want to go to your room , to lock yourself inside and say , &quot; &quot; that &apos;s enough . &quot; &quot; a bomb fell not far from my car — well , far enough , but big noise .
i wondered , what work ?
he replied : &quot; &quot; the spirit of the forest told us . &quot; &quot; for me , this was a game changer , a radical change .
each color you see is a tree species .
these leaders have proven that nonviolence works in places like budrus .
but there were others around me who weren &apos;t even cowering .
or as some economists call it , present bias .
so this notion of loss aversion kicks in when it comes to savings too , because people , mentally and emotionally and intuitively frame savings as a loss because i have to cut my spending .
( laughter ) comedy is very popular .
why comedy ?
thanks very much to them for allowing me to do that .
some things actually do stick out .
for us as individuals who live in the digital now and spend most of our waking moments in it , the challenge is to live in two streams of time that are parallel and almost simultaneous .
i think that technology has altered that flow of time .
and now take a look at the death rates from lung cancer in women over time .
and this is a question that haunts those of us in science and medicine who believe that we are on the verge of being able to dramatically improve the health of women .
but that basic math accounts both for the steep slope and for the long , flat tail .
if your system is designed so that you have to give up a quarter of the value , re-engineer the system .
and this has already saved millions of lives , and it has prevented entire economies from capsizing in sub-saharan africa .
thank you very much .
you &apos;re heading towards the sistine chapel .
not really an easy sell , stories on a ceiling .
( laughter ) this is the natural posture of a man sitting , squatting for ventilation purposes . ( laughter )
( laughter ) 4 am in the morning . ( laughter )
we now understand that those microbes have more impact on our climate and regulating co2 and oxygen than plants do , which we always thought oxygenate the atmosphere .
i thought i &apos;d take a moment to tell you what a genome is .
it &apos;s completely fucked up and can only be explained in song .
you &apos;re live .
i &apos;m a medical illustrator , and i come from a slightly different point of view .
so we have an opportunity to really open up education .
it &apos;s in operation between earth and mars .
they &apos;re emotional . they &apos;re aware .
and then i was also surprised by the city &apos;s propensity for kindness and care as opposed to indifference or worse .
now i was getting a little anxious .
it seemed kind of odd to do , and actually , that first meeting , i remember thinking , &quot; i have to be the one to ask the next question , &quot; because i knew i was going to huff and puff during this conversation .
what you &apos;re doing , right now , at this very moment , is killing you .
it made me think , am i doing the right thing ?
my parents also fled to pakistan , and settled in quetta , where i was born .
such a system is operationally rigid , politically closed , and morally illegitimate .
so i went and did the only thing i could . i studied it .
we &apos;ve developed a preventive maintenance system which can be installed on any aircraft .
first , the industrial revolution brought us machines and factories , railways , electricity , air travel , and our lives have never been the same .
it could take an hour . it could take weeks .
a photo is a reminder of someone or something , a place , a relationship , a loved one .
when you meet people who seem like an exception to the rule , oftentimes it &apos;s that the rule is broken , not that they &apos;re an exception to it .
no , not as a gay person like some of my friends , but as a muslim , and decided to start wearing the hijab , my head covering .
in tibetan culture , they are performing very important sky burials . in places like tibet , there are no places to bury the dead , or wood to cremate them , so these vultures provide a natural disposal system .
they are hardly monogamous . ( laughter ) ( applause ) they are far from being extinct . ( laughter ) and , my favorite is , vultures are better looking . ( applause ) ( laughter ) so there &apos;s two types of vultures in this planet .
pictures were taken every day : day one , day two ...
but then it gets better . day 96 , he goes home .
last september of 2011 , i started an online magazine for teenage girls called rookiemag.com.
i mean , we have articles called &quot; on taking yourself seriously : how to not care what people think of you , &quot; but we also have articles like , oops — i &apos;m figuring it out !
i go in their homes . and we do this worldwide , and we follow them around town with video cameras .
and i know what you &apos;re asking — did i test it ?
so arab women of my generation have had to become our own role models .
there he exploded .
come back down , you weigh twice as much .
we had about 20 people who made donations — we raised $ 150,000 in donations for children &apos;s charities — who flew with us .
if you look at the microbes in one of the air handling units in this building , you &apos;ll see that they &apos;re all very similar to one another .
mechanical engineers design air handling units to make sure that people are comfortable , that the air flow and temperature is just right .
i &apos;ve got a little experiment i want to try with you .
they weren &apos;t allowed to stay there anymore ; they had to be returned to vienna — as i say , an unfeasibly long way away in those days .
it was such a radical change , in fact , that the early macintosh development team in &apos; 82 , &apos; 83 , &apos; 84 had to write an entirely new operating system from the ground up .
this stuff was undertaken at mit and the media lab under the incredible direction of professor hiroshi ishii , director of the tangible media group .
the first play is we recruit the very best talent our country has to offer , and recruit them for short tours of duty inside government .
the united states digital service is doing exactly that .
how can the nervous system get this so wrong ? how can the nervous system
it &apos;s the symptom of a tumor or an infection or an inflammation or an operation .
but it &apos;s not like that everywhere .
but let &apos;s go back to the 2.6 million babies who die before they &apos;re one month old .
( laughter ) so we &apos;re going to see more and more of this sort of robot over the next few years in labs .
( laughter ) not appropriate . no . no . ( laughter )
it &apos;s not easy to describe as a demographic .
i built — i put a garage-door opener up in the attic that would pull this door up .
and then only after this is done are you allowed to do this , begin to put forward architectural manifestations that manifest those positions .
now , if there is anyone here from american airlines , please consider doing your christmas party here .
it brought much , much needed medical care to people who wouldn &apos;t get it .
( applause ) dm : as my mother said , we are the future hope , and the men are only killing in somalia .
then everything else was very gradual .
ca : you &apos;re a very smart computer coder , and you &apos;re hellish stubborn .
miami .
a gentleman named lebron james came up and he took a three to tie .
these are opium-addicted people on the roofs of kabul 10 years after the beginning of our war .
my travels to afghanistan began many , many years ago on the eastern border of my country , my homeland , poland .
what is missing is a sense of urgency .
we have the technologies .
it &apos;s been successful beyond our dreams .
and they &apos;re going to break ground in may .
this ought to concern deeply those of us who care about the future of religion and the future of faith .
and yet , we know that it is systems of oppression that benefit the most from the lie of radical individualism .
found every stone , placed them just so through the rain and the cold .
make the audience put things together .
that &apos;s what cities do . that &apos;s how they create value , is by slamming things together .
and if we can eventually get good solar in space , that also could help .
these families had been through what we had been watching on the tv .
we need to build a world where children can dream of planes dropping gifts , and not bombs .
so i thought , three words for one concept . this is not good .
southern sudan was a very different story .
but when something like this happens , things are qualitatively changing .
we have lots of cells that are not out for themselves anymore .
it &apos;s an invisible crisis , and it has been for many , many years .
we call it the eastern district , the most violent district , the most impoverished district — 46 percent unemployment in that district .
and , you know , lots of countries do this . he was writing initially about the states , but we know the alliance francaise is all about french soft power , the british council .
now , that is the india that is emerging into the 21st century .
we bring to each image our own values , our own belief systems , and as a result of that , the image resonates with us .
these gorillas were murdered , some would even say crucified , and unsurprisingly , they sparked international outrage .
here &apos;s a bayonette from the civil war .
here &apos;s a set of bone marrow biopsy tools .
we &apos;re going to try a launching of what we can think of as a super pac to end all super pacs .
so intel said your average spreadsheet would be flawed once every 27,000 years .
this is just some stuff you can do on the computer from the desktop .
but now it &apos;s a door .
but normally we can &apos;t access nearly all of it .
the record is always trending downward , but it &apos;s punctuated by these steep cliffs .
i &apos;ve done my grieving about the loss .
but the idea that we can gently grow there with a few minor hiccups is just wrong , and it &apos;s dangerously wrong , because it means we &apos;re not getting ready for what &apos;s really going to happen .
as part of selling , i was able to document the hard core evidence .
i recall how they were seriously boiling the concoction .
you &apos;ve probably heard of benzene rings ; they &apos;re very carcinogenic .
the first thing that you have on the tax is — you have a tax for a stronger america — 33 cents .
this is just one example .
so i hope i &apos;ve changed the way you look at at least some of the stuff in your life .
i &apos;ll have him cut out letters out of construction paper for the board . &quot; &quot; i thought this was a great assignment .
now , i should pause and say , what do i mean by puzzle ?
so we have three pictures , potentially of the same person of the same age as leonardo at the time .
( applause )
now , we &apos;ve had the opportunity to look at how people hear real and posed laughter across the age range .
first of all , they heard some laughs , and they had to say , how real or posed do these laughs sound ?
but we don &apos;t stay on mars time for more than three to four months .
will i wake them up ? is it ok to call ?
a lot of very sober-minded physicists , believe it or not , have had exactly the same thought .
we sent a probe out to this asteroid belt , called near , near earth asteroid rendezvous .
we are going to be okay .
i rode in the trucks and walked the routes and interviewed people in offices and facilities all over the city , and i learned a lot , but i was still an outsider .
there &apos;s two little ones left .
and it felt like having a roommate point a loaded gun at you for six months .
td : lakshmi has worked incredibly hard , even in inviting me , let alone everything else that she has done to make this happen , and i was somewhat resistant at times , and i was also very nervous throughout this week .
td : so those were just a few remarks about my personal background .
so we &apos;ve started this effort . we &apos;ve made a few hits , a few , i think , embryonic discoveries .
we have a behavioral superpower in our brain , and it at least in part involves dopamine .
now , for me , what i find exciting about data philanthropy — donating data , donating decision scientists and donating technology — it &apos;s what it means for young professionals like me who are choosing to work at companies .
you need to look at all of the different transportation routes as well .
i &apos;mma cop something dope , just wait , you &apos;ll see .
not one spot of dirt . the airs were brand new .
we are squandering the most valuable resource we have on this continent : the valuable resource of the imagination .
my father was educated in cork , in the university of cork , in the &apos; 50s .
now i have a close friend , joel pett , who &apos;s the editorial cartoonist for the lexington herald-leader .
now comedy travels along a distinct wavelength from other forms of language .
lips are not lips , but volcanoes .
why ? because we cannot ignore the metaphorical meaning of words either .
humans and bonobos are the only animals that have sex face-to-face when both of them are alive .
these women are the mosuo from southwestern china .
this is the usda portion size , that little , tiny thing .
we really are what we eat .
they have to , in 2005 , have a distinct identity for all their models of cars .
so , it &apos;s tens of millions of calculations just to design one connection between a piece of structural steel and another piece of structural steel .
and rufus is going to be doing some improvisation on his custom , five-string electric cello , and it &apos;s very exciting to listen to him .
and so the two of us are here to give you an example of creation .
thank you .
and i call this place the cloud .
and when you make them light in the right way , that can be simpler and cheaper to make .
and then we can replace the other half with a combination of advanced bio-fuels and safe natural gas .
so , the photograph becomes this teaser and incites desire and voyeurism ; what you can &apos;t have , you want more .
and it &apos;s that wish , or that desire , that i suppose i &apos;m dealing with in my work .
he &apos;s not so accurate , not so quick .
since that time , we &apos;ve understood much more about these cells .
now , marketing has done a very , very good job of creating opportunities for impulse buying .
( laughter ) so , actually , he tried making it compulsory .
and it &apos;s getting worse , and pretty soon kids are going to die of it again because it &apos;s just a numbers game .
we leap into the arms of big placebo .
and when it inevitably does , the best and the brightest reach for the financial equivalent of the junk shot — in this case , throwing massive amounts of much-needed public money down a very different kind of hole .
the fact is that we simply don &apos;t know when the warming that we create will be utterly overwhelmed by feedback loops .
but rooted in that , little did she know how much knowledge she was acquiring about geometry and just math and logic and all the rest .
and that was to recognize that when you sit around the table , the actual location of the people becomes rather important .
they heal rifts and they bridge divides .
so i was excited , then i panicked , then i was excited , then i panicked , and in between the excitement and the panicking , i started to do my research , and my research primarily consisted of googling how to give a great ted talk .
what do you prefer ? before or after ?
one day , i was glancing through my bank statement ( i didn &apos;t have much to look at ) and i &apos;ve noticed that in the upper corner there was a symbol , that i &apos;m going to show you , saying that document had been made in plain language , for me to understand it .
so the question is , is there any hope for adoption of something like this , which would presumably save a lot of lives ?
and also it turned out these bench seats are the very best way to install car seats .
so think about this , right ?
it came in at speeds that were tremendous , slammed into the ground , blew up , and exploded with the energy of roughly a 20-megaton nuclear bomb — a very hefty bomb .
so as kids like victor are creating projects like this , they &apos;re learning important concepts like variables , but that &apos;s just the start .
and that creates some new blocks for you , and also creates a little scoreboard that keeps track of the score , so each time i click on &quot; &quot; change score , &quot; &quot; it increments the score .
and the first of these is to take some comfort in its universality .
so the first consistent component of regret is basically denial .
( applause ) that &apos;s it without the case on .
but , of course , they don &apos;t look like rocks and sludge now .
their commitment to diversity is evident through their global inclusion programs .
i stopped engaging in clubs and leadership activities .
as part of an initiation for three of their members , they had to kill somebody , and i happened to be the guy walking down bleecker street that night , and they jumped on me without a word .
the guy on the right had a knife with a 10-inch blade , and he went in under my elbow , and it went up and cut my inferior vena cava .
but when i don &apos;t know and when i haven &apos;t been asked , that &apos;s when the problem arises .
because what we don &apos;t know can actually hurt us .
so ask yourself this question : what really made the modern computer possible ?
a thousand years later , a mammoth died in southern germany .
i can &apos;t draw .
i can code .
and what the surgeon might do is take some bone from your iliac crest , which is just here , and then transplant that somewhere else in the body .
and one of the ways that you can think about repairing your fracture is this procedure here , called an iliac crest harvest .
( applause ) kb : what a tongue .
but there &apos;s a whole side to their lives that we hardly ever see and had never been filmed .
it &apos;s a highly focused product aimed at strictly the education market , not only in the developing countries , but actually in the developed regions as well , because there are parts of the united states where this can have also a huge impact on the ability to make education more fun and more efficient .
but to give you an idea how creative this group of people can be , one of the objectives of the one laptop per child is to be able to achieve a 10-hour battery life .
so , back in the ancient times .
if it is sounding familiar , it is because i was at the same time in my life listening to the beatles .
i sent out some facebook messages , some twitter messages , and i gave people the opportunity to buy the naming rights to my 2011 ted talk .
woman : if dan were a brand , he might be a classic convertible mercedes benz .
we have to be responsible for setting and enforcing the boundaries that we want in our life .
meditate for half an hour .
and secondly , where did the leprosy bacteria come from ?
( applause )
it heats up for about 30 minutes , cools for an hour .
weighs about eight pounds , and this is the way it works .
what reality are you creating for yourself ?
it is not objective reality .
every time i use my mobile phone ?
and i asked them once , and i asked them again , and i got no real answer . it was only blah blah answers .
and it &apos;s not just a privacy or a cybersecurity problem .
but not everyone can afford an iphone .
it &apos;s based on the presumption , the observation even , that all important technologies go through four stages in their life — at least one of the four stages , sometimes all four of the stages .
you know , there could be a film &apos;s &#91; unclear &#93; there , but it &apos;s basically , every song ever made could be stored on 400 dollars worth of storage by 2008 . it takes that entire element , the physical element , of songs off the table .
that &apos;s the world people actually want .
but there &apos;s a fourth thing .
we understand that these will become much more virulent , that what we see today is this interweaving of societies , of systems , fastened by technologies and hastened by just-in-time management systems .
we &apos;ve seen it in the financial crisis . we &apos;ve seen it in the pandemic flu .
when we put these two probes together ...
( applause )
for the past three years , i &apos;ve been going around the world meeting people like justine sacco — and believe me , there &apos;s a lot of people like justine sacco .
nobody went after that person .
you can &apos;t be sure , and that &apos;s okay .
i devoured science fiction as a child . i still do .
at that age , obviously , i couldn &apos;t express it that way , but i told her i didn &apos;t feel right .
so say if you cut a period stop in half , a full stop , that &apos;s about the size of the whole thing .
what an achievement that is .
( applause ) thank you . thank you . ( applause ) thank you very much . wow . ( applause )
so that &apos;s more than 100 trillion miles .
but i know that it &apos;s there .
now , i don &apos;t romanticize evolutionary time .
more pools formed , more riffle sections , all of which were great for wildlife habitats .
why is it that people like her , like all of them are not more well known ?
they killed 67 , including poets and pregnant women .
i know it wasn &apos;t personal .
i believe the potential for widespread positive change is absolutely enormous because i know what we &apos;re capable of .
but i can tell you , this is the moment to celebrate through connecting ourselves with those people in the street and expressing our support to them and expressing this kind of feeling , universal feeling , of supporting the weak and the oppressed to create a much better future for all of us .
what should people here at ted , here in the west , do if they want to connect or make a difference and they believe in what &apos;s happening here ?
and if that &apos;s true , then what we want to do is we want to go through four lessons from the greeks and one lesson from a latin american .
and what if they provide as much information about who and what you are as any tattoo ever would ?
we had two more children after that .
and they tried everything they had .
i have no idea if you &apos;re seeing this , but i &apos;m just going to look ahead and trust that you &apos;re there .
i &apos;d found a way to eternal life , at the expense of the one thing navid loved most , which was to touch and be touched .
what they all do is important .
kids made hamburger cards that were made out of construction paper .
but we have to recognize that we have those limitations .
she &apos;s waiting for the market to open a little impatiently .
i might trust my most loquacious friend to keep a conversation going but not — but perhaps not to keep a secret .
so i &apos;m going to talk about trust , and i &apos;m going to start by reminding you of the standard views that people have about trust .
i was one of those kids that , every time i got in the car , i basically had to roll down the window .
this last project is also of components .
since we opened the website in february , we now have 640,000 students from 190 countries .
second , it would enable lifelong learning .
then we were victims of don porfirio .
i &apos;m going to talk about four different levels of civil response against violence , from weakest to strongest .
now you may ask , why have i done these things ?
( music : george frideric handel , &quot; &quot; chaconne in g major . &quot; &quot; performed by daria van den bercken . ) ( applause ) thank you . ( applause )
the first day they all came back .
because you still have 80 percent of the traffic .
now , anatomy is by its very nature a visual science , and the first anatomists to understand this lived during the renaissance .
artistry can also be seen in the repair and recovery of the human body .
and when you layer that over with the kind of ubiquitous communications that we &apos;re starting to see , what you find is , in fact , even more access suffused into spaces .
i asked how to do the greater ridgeway , and it told me to go via guernsey .
but that &apos;s not right .
it &apos;s value created by the participants for each other .
for some people , we varied how much money they could get away with — how much money they could steal .
they told me that they had the right model of the patient — that they knew what was the right thing to do to minimize my pain — and they also told me that the word patient doesn &apos;t mean to make suggestions or to interfere or ...
each man &apos;s head was hacked off in turn and held up to the crowd .
but we &apos;re not passive when we watch .
patrick .
they don &apos;t exist .
thirty-five years ago , when i would have been graduating from high school , they told us that 40,000 kids every day died because of poverty .
we &apos;ve got to make all this violence against the poor illegal .
for my virtual worlds are perfect .
it is critical , as these virtual worlds continue to mirror the real world we live in , that game developers realize that they have tremendous responsibilities before them .
everything is onboard , and it jumped in response to the student just flicking on a desk lamp next to it .
now , you can think of these as robotic versions of something that you &apos;re all very familiar with : an ant .
put it back .
as soon as the door closed ...
and once that happened , once this material was in latin , it formed the basis for mathematics textbooks for almost 600 years .
( applause )
mantra stands for movement and action network for transformation of rural areas .
and we came together and formed a project called mantra .
there were too many people .
we &apos;ve gotten used to it .
the value of freedom . it &apos;s a value of community .
these tools that we built enable this sharing in parts through licenses that make it clear and a freedom to create without requiring permission first because the permission has already been granted and a respect for the creator because it builds upon a copyright the creator has licensed freely .
but i want to show you a different approach , and this is this robot over here , which has four legs .
so what you &apos;re seeing here are a couple of machines — a pattern of locomotion .
my bosses , in the beginning , were very surprised .
and music has a rhythm , has ups and downs .
i wish that i could live together with black people .
we didn &apos;t get any because we have a car and a house .
and i was hooked again on the importance of what i did .
you can &apos;t delay that much .
the second example is a master plan of 2,000 apartments and facilities in the city of tunis .
and also it has this idea of the public space that uses the outdoors to create activity .
let &apos;s invest in building pan-african titans like sudanese businessman mo ibrahim .
one : you loan 200 dollars to each of 500 banana farmers allowing them to dry their surplus bananas and fetch 15 percent more revenue at the local market .
this is amazing .
so it &apos;s very hard to find out what &apos;s the role of each over time .
i want a web where i can use healthcare with privacy and where there &apos;s a lot of health data , clinical data is available to scientists to do research .
let &apos;s do that this year .
and what they showed me is that , well , firstly , it &apos;s at least to say odd that we don &apos;t treat these pigs as absolute kings and queens .
it &apos;s used in paint for the texture , but also for the glossiness .
i did this to do what was right , and i &apos;m not going to stop my work in the public interest just to benefit myself .
there are ties of fraternity that bond us together , and if we destroy these bonds by undermining the standards , the security , the manner of behavior , that nations and citizens all around the world expect us to abide by .
i was literally on the side of a cliff , capturing the stars and the moonlight as it transitions , the moonlight lighting el capitan .
so this is a typical day , 12-18 hours , non-stop capturing the entire day unfold .
no amount of smiling at a flight of stairs has ever made it turn into a ramp .
for lots of us , disabled people are not our teachers or our doctors or our manicurists .
and we &apos;re seeing a steady increase among males .
so what &apos;s the solution ? it &apos;s not my job .
whatever it is , whatever this new economy is , what we need the economy to do , in fact , is to put investment back into the heart of the model , to re-conceive investment .
it is about allowing ourselves the freedom to become fully human , recognizing the depth and the breadth of the human psyche and building institutions to protect rembrandt &apos;s fragile altruist within .
well , i leave that one up to you to judge .
and i suppose i &apos;m a selfish environmentalist .
so if i just choose a note at random , like that one .
those of you who can see will know how many notes , but derek , of course , can &apos;t .
it is , as you can see , very small and also very cheap .
some people will say it &apos;s for public health research .
he &apos;s making a , kind of , cheek-flapping sound .
and the idea is to visualize their speech and song behind them with a large screen .
you could have that kind of immersive experience of being underwater — of feeling like you &apos;re underwater — seeing what &apos;s going on .
and in my own practice , from product to approtec , it &apos;s really exciting that we &apos;re taking a more human-centered approach to design , that we &apos;re including behaviors and personalities in the things we do , and i think this is great .
( nature sounds ) coming up is the sound of a woodpecker .
but you have heard how biophonies help clarify our understanding of the natural world .
it &apos;s in this world , &quot; &quot; he said .
it made its way up his neck , cutting off his ability to breathe , and stopped just beneath the eyes .
but it will also lay waste to imagination .
waiting 10 years for the payoff from education is too long when you need to meet daily needs , when you &apos;ve got siblings to look after or a business to help with .
it &apos;s not his money , of course .
fg : that will be finished in 2003 — september , october — and i &apos;m hoping kyu , and herbie , and yo-yo and all those guys come play with us at that place .
there &apos;s a talk about gratitude .
well here &apos;s one by jessica green about the microbial ecology of buildings .
and guess what ?
( laughter ) i hope one day , i will get the chance to tell the stories of all other women , all other amazing women i know in my country .
it actually costs an enormous amount to mop up the damage from the dropout crisis .
culture is an organic term , isn &apos;t it ?
so , it really is down to you .
since 1901 , medicine has advanced greatly .
we need transformational change .
this is our national museum today .
it goes all the way back to aristotle .
it says very clearly what the drug is for , specifically who it is good for , so you can start to personalize your understanding of whether the information is relevant to you or whether the drug is relevant to you .
there &apos;s trains and planes and cars and bill o &apos;reilly , he &apos;s very noisy .
the world health organization just did a big study that they published this year .
i thought i was there to make a single documentary and would then move on to some other part of the world .
but if that &apos;s such an easy choice , why don &apos;t more groups use it ?
so there &apos;s really only one area where we &apos;re near the top , and that &apos;s in failing to give our teachers the help they need to develop their skills .
it doesn &apos;t matter whether you &apos;re a basketball player , a tennis player , a gymnast or a bridge player .
democracy was the political innovation that allowed us to limit the power , whether it was of tyrants or of high priests , their natural tendency to maximize power and wealth .
greece , you see , was only a preview of what is in store for us all .
you know , you can tell — and i think when we &apos;re getting into collective play , its really important for groups to gain a sense of safety through their own sharing of play signals .
and we begin to lose those signals , culturally and otherwise , as adults .
so we live in a world of satellite communication , are used to global communication , but it &apos;s still amazing to me .
and two boats : when the second boat was added , what happened was that some of the dolphins left the area completely .
i wanted to keep us healthy .
today , you can have a complete sequence of the three billion base pairs in the human genome at a cost of about 20,000 dollars and in the space of about a week .
it &apos;s a global trance .
a very simple definition .
their images fuelled resistance to the war and to racism .
i believed the photographers and so did millions of other americans .
so much of this ignorance , this civic illiteracy , is willful .
power has a negative moral valence .
( laughter ) but that makes no sense to me .
okay , who here knew that &quot; &quot; friend &quot; &quot; hasn &apos;t always been a verb ?
the search is not for the solution of the problem , but for problems themselves worth solving .
if that step proves too difficult for the person or team that made the discovery , a mathematician can then be added by them as a collaborator .
as you can see , there &apos;s a bubble of air and it &apos;s bouncing around inside .
there &apos;s a mannequin hidden behind a wall , and we &apos;re going to bounce light off the door .
who knows ?
because it has to end .
both , if we &apos;re honest , a bust .
it &apos;s got to come from us , and i see this process of deciding democratically in a bottom-up fashion what the world wants to work on together as one vital means by which we can crowdsource the force to really build that constituency that &apos;s going to reinvigorate global governance in the 21st century .
let &apos;s take a look at san francisco .
you can see the lgbt community is not really getting along with the geek community that well , the arts community , the music community .
men are still socialized to believe that they have to be breadwinners , that to derive their self-worth from how high they can climb over other men on a career ladder .
( applause ) i can almost hear lots of you thinking , &quot; &quot; no way . &quot; &quot; but in fact , the change is actually already happening .
( applause ) nl : thank you . ( applause )
so instead we &apos;re going to do 93 years in 93 seconds or less .
it &apos;s fairly simple .
so , could we use that in mobile phones ?
last year at ted long beach , we built an installation that builds installations .
so what do we need if we want to do this at the human scale ?
one application is in education .
( laughter ) ( applause ) so now you may ask why children &apos;s lies are so difficult to detect .
it would be like 36,000 people staring at 36,000 monitors each and every day , without so much as a coffee break .
and we do this every time that a video is uploaded to youtube .
but also , because he was an inveterate hacker , he left a tiny digital wormhole through which he alone could crawl .
we just never knew how to get there , what we were doing .
it &apos;s ours , we have an abundance of it .
you &apos;re one of the few people in a position to really swing the debate .
he &apos;s pledged to live on 18,000 pounds a year — that &apos;s less than 30,000 dollars — and to give the rest to those organizations .
i wonder how many of you , looking at that , said to yourselves just now , &quot; &quot; i would not have done that .
very useful second ecosystem service .
i had been seduced by that potato and not another into planting its — into spreading its genes , giving it a little bit more habitat .
thank you .
so , many people have this romantic notion of astronomers going to the telescope on a lonely mountaintop and looking at the spectacular night sky through a big telescope .
congestion pricing is being discussed in every major city around the world and is , again , wirelessly enabled .
and road pricing is where we &apos;re all going to have to go , because today we pay for our maintenance and wear and tear on our cars with gas taxes .
kb : where are we ? where are we ?
now , follow my actions exactly .
the vai people of liberia had a long tradition of literacy before their first contact with europeans in the 1800s .
this ethiopic cross illustrates what dr. ron eglash has established : that africa has a lot to contribute to computing and mathematics through their intuitive grasp of fractals .
and i would add that bin laden and his followers are consciously devoted to the goal of creating a conflict between democracy , or at least capitalist democracy , on the one hand , and the world of islam as they see and define it .
the war has tremendous risks for the model that i &apos;m describing because it &apos;s very possible that as a consequence of a war , many muslims will conclude that the united states is not the kind of place that they want to emulate with respect to its forms of political government .
in the us , where i &apos;m from , it &apos;s about one million people .
we need to listen to patients &apos; stories , and we need to be willing to say , &quot; &quot; i don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; i don &apos;t know &quot; &quot; is a beautiful thing .
these films held what was too hurtful to say out loud , and they became more useful to me than the whispers of survivors and the occasional glimpse of a tattoo on a maiden aunt &apos;s wrist .
my story started in england with a clean slate and the silence of immigrant parents .
and they engage with the real world .
there is a new &quot; &quot; eppasod &quot; &quot; of crimer show on twitter pretty much every day , and they &apos;re archived that way .
the computer tells you how to drive — turn left , turn right , speed up , stop .
we just put a blind person in it and we &apos;re done , right ?
a mouse has about 1,000 times as many neurons as a fly .
they have a sophisticated eye which is the fastest visual system on the planet .
so it &apos;s basically like a computer .
can we understand youtube ?
unfortunately , by the time that a medic actually gets to you , what the medic has on his or her belt can take five minutes or more , with the application of pressure , to stop that type of bleed .
so the cell is the most basic unit of life .
to do that , we need to focus on five strategic imperatives , all of which have one thing in common : putting people first .
and second , how do we fix it ?
second , no doubt more familiar to you , is the nature of modern american education : scripted , lock-step curricula .
and as a result , they lose their gifts , or worse , they stop playing altogether .
np : where it came from .
ec : ... when i was growing up in the &apos; 90s .
&quot; i mustn &apos;t love you , &quot; i said to them . &quot; but i will ask god for forgiveness . &quot;
he found the foster parents , and he said to them , &quot; &quot; treat this as an adoption . he &apos;s yours forever .
when the contractors have gone bust , as they &apos;ve been overleveraged like everyone else , the difference is everything goes missing , documentation , passports , and tickets home for these workers .
but , quite frankly , on this issue , there is no other road .
firefly romance is risky .
these luminous landscapes still fill me with wonder , and they keep me connected to the magic of the natural world .
so the combination of source and filter is how we produce speech .
it &apos;s not such an ominous thing .
we try and use our technology to improve our lives in one way or another .
that &apos;s what we do .
in 1997 , this building opened .
let me show you how this plays out in a project that my firm recently completed .
so what happened on this day ?
and we all now feel some ownership in our own pop culture .
( laughter ) that &apos;s why the mascot of internet engineering , if it had one , is said to be the bumblebee .
but they had an amazing freedom , which was they didn &apos;t have to make any money from it .
we &apos;re entering uncharted territory , and yet our expertise and our systems are based on the past .
the roofs not only temper urban heat island impact but they save energy , and therefore money , the emissions that cause climate change , and they also reduce stormwater runoff .
this is your place , you stay here . &quot; &quot; and indeed , the police came — because they ’ ll just arrest us and put us in jail and release us whenever they feel like , after the 20th or so .
so as part of organizing this and whatever , this commemoration , the police will round us up as they call us leaders .
not so with an o.
up to that point , all the fonts on screen had been adapted from previously existing printing fonts , of course .
so when we came back to italy , and one of the things that i remember the most is my family having this hard time to share stories .
he needs proper medical attention .
you are not going to be sitting in that time machine .
the earth and mars will have looked pretty much exactly like that — volcanoes everywhere , evaporating lakes everywhere , minerals , hot springs , and then you see those mounds on the shore of those lakes ?
and i &apos;m going to start with some of our own experience .
so let &apos;s look at how often the technology has to do the right thing .
they are objects of desire .
and my last example of how constraints can boost creativity comes from the green , because this is a weird color , a crazy color , and you need to replace the green screens eventually and you must figure that out sooner rather than later .
in front of this tank there &apos;s a man on a bicycle with a breadbasket on his head . to any passerby , there &apos;s no problem with this visual .
so i took one &quot; &quot; no &quot; &quot; off a tombstone from the islamic museum in cairo , and i added a message to it : &quot; no to military rule . &quot;
the greeks believed that weeping together created a bond between people .
it &apos;s what is meant by overcoming the horror that we feel when we are under threat of our enemies , and beginning to appreciate the other .
two weeks later , i was ready to return home .
i feel as if my blog , my email , twitter and facebook have given me a substitute for everyday conversation .
this explains most contemporary political debates .
the third , is this too much information ?
i &apos;m really just talking about the compendium of social practices of adaptation that enable many of these migrant communities to transgress imposed political and economic recipes of urbanization .
so these are houses waiting to cross the border .
so what will it take to get started building the first charter cities , scaling this so we build many more ?
he does , though , have a little bit of light down in the south that has a very special status .
so we created a factory system consistent with that false view of human nature .
i &apos;m talking about another technology .
you find elephants , rhinos , monkeys , pigs , etc .
i think it &apos;s important to promote in a more positive way on how we see ourselves .
who is going to allow a bunch of little girls , dressed up — &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) &quot; — to come inside a jail and dance with their daddies in spongebob suits ? &quot;
even the guards cried .
last i heard , there are two dozen universities in china right now teaching all in english .
english is taking over .
but this one morning i jumped in and found this thresher that had just recently died in the gill net .
here we see a female crawling out of the ocean under moonlight on the island of trinidad .
and i just waited for the time that i could go off and read my books .
now , most of us work in open plan offices , without walls , where we are subject to the constant noise and gaze of our coworkers .
i think there &apos;s — i don &apos;t know what data would impress you , but how about , 43 percent of the refined fuel produced in the world is consumed by cars in metropolitan areas in the united states .
yes , it could be attached to this , and yes , on a kilogram of propane , you could drive from new york to boston if you so choose .
and it &apos;s really time we start thinking more creatively about how they can be fused .
so , blue , blue , everything became blue .
that is a great tragedy — which i &apos;m carrying still with me and i hope that all of you will carry this with you — that the profession still legitimizes publication of knowledge of people without attributing them by making them anonymous .
think for a minute .
i think that becoming aware of this general imposture that concerns all of us would ease our love relationships .
how many people are going to love me ? &quot; &quot; and how does he respond to this anxiety ?
that &apos;s how far the lion can see in all directions until his or her view is obstructed by vegetation .
the lower left shows a lion sizing up a herd of impala for a kill , and the right shows what i call the lion viewshed .
i have eternal imposter syndrome .
i earned my doctorate at columbia university .
how would your consciousness handle your body being delocalized in space ?
we turned off the lights , and then we put it in a vacuum and sucked out all the air , and then we cooled it down to just a fraction of a degree above absolute zero .
and they didn &apos;t die because they didn &apos;t have anthrax anymore .
so you can find a little feature on a bacterium that you don &apos;t like , like staphylococcus — i don &apos;t like it in particular , because it killed a professor friend of mine last year .
you &apos;ll notice that the building is rather austere .
and we &apos;re not just investing in the kids .
now , this is starting to happen in transistors .
the retina chip that we designed sits behind this lens here .
countless lives have been saved by canaries in coalmines — a simple and invaluable way for miners to know whether they &apos;re safe .
most of the information that we collected on the cholera outbreak didn &apos;t come from testing water ; it came from forms like this , which documented all the people we failed to help .
but because we haven &apos;t learned from this history , nonviolent struggle as a technique is widely misunderstood .
they stayed there for months as protests spread throughout the country .
they could be quite mild .
now there are two features of mosquito biology that really help us in this project , and that is , firstly , males don &apos;t bite .
thank you very much .
and for us to understand what happens with them , we &apos;re going to follow brad .
( applause )
i check and — ( applause ) i check that email account religiously all the time .
or we can monitor doctors prescribing behaviors , passively , and see how the diffusion of innovation with pharmaceuticals occurs within &#91; networks of &#93; doctors .
if you pick this person , the only friend they have to nominate is this person , who , by construction , must have at least two and typically more friends .
ka : well , i think that &apos;s interesting .
dr : we certainly did as much research as we could , and we were conscious of other memorials .
now , i want to be clear here .
for many years , because there was no standardization in the definition of pms , when psychologists tried to report prevalence rates , their estimates ranged from five percent of women to 97 percent of women , so at the same time almost no one and almost everyone had pms .
he wasn &apos;t even registered .
what would it take to mobilize 100 percent ?
i will show you their creative ways of dealing with tough questions .
and we had another couple who made books — a book for each child .
i am 12 years old .
so that leads me back to virtual reality .
we all have a bit of their dna in us .
and some of them are going to be great , and some of them are going to be irritating , but they &apos;re all related to me .
the story continues in the 1980s and &apos; 90s .
a social dance isn &apos;t choreographed by any one person .
it can be put up in any environment , from an asphalt parking lot to pastures or fields , because it doesn &apos;t require any special setup or specialty tools .
now , usually when people hear statistics or stats like that , you start thinking about places like haiti or other kind of exotic or maybe even impoverished areas , but it happens right here in the united states every single year .
and in france , there is a startup calle compte nickel , which is revolutionizing the banking sector .
he has created a fridge made entirely of clay that consumes no electricity .
some of the things that emerge from it are local food projects , like community-supported agriculture schemes , urban food production , creating local food directories , and so on .
and that gap continues to widen .
and in the novel , a particular one named alvin is created . and he says , maybe this isn &apos;t the best way , and wrecks the whole system .
and arthur was looking at this old book , and he said , &quot; &quot; well , that was wrong .
( applause )
sixty-seven percent of the population had at least one ace , and 12.6 percent , one in eight , had four or more aces .
&quot; you &apos;re safe now . &quot;
thanks very much for listening .
pandora &apos;s tim westergren knows this better than most .
which brings us to soap opera lesson two : sacrifice your ego and drop the superiority complex .
if we can make matter alive , would we have a matterhazard ?
but not only just that , we will start to think about how we can start to develop a symbiotic relationship with biology .
shocked , the mayor decided to step aside rather than participate or lead a procession that was ostensibly in support of organized crime .
if we assume that the narcos only have access to the wholesale part , which we know is false , that still leaves you with yearly revenues of anywhere between 15 billion and 60 billion dollars .
he &apos;s been shot in the foot with a rubber bullet .
they are trying to change the behavior of the community from inside .
so a couple of things i &apos;ve created are , there &apos;s a poster over here that you can play drums on .
i &apos;ll just describe how this works .
well , i &apos;m involved in other things , besides physics .
one thing is distant relationships among human languages .
at age 17 , he started asking the kinds of questions that you &apos;d expect of someone with a beginner &apos;s mind .
bhutan , for those of you who don &apos;t know it , is the newest democracy in the world , just two years ago .
the sound is getting translated to a pattern of vibration on the vest .
and as recently as 15 years ago , there were a lot of scientists who thought these technologies wouldn &apos;t work .
over the course of the past several months , the world has watched as unarmed black men , and women , have had their lives taken at the hands of police and vigilante .
why was homework really that important ?
where you are sitting now would be under water .
the important point is that we will have started a process that is out of humanity &apos;s control .
when a cmu prisoner has a visit , the rest of the prison is on lockdown .
neither of them underwent the formal review process that is required by law when they were opened .
if you think about this man , 46 years later , still sticking to this non-violent response to a severe political and human rights issue .
thank you very much .
no , i didn &apos;t get wet . am i going to get wet ? am i going to get wet ? &quot; &quot; that &apos;s the experience of a clever ride .
( laughter ) and the question he had is , &quot; can i do it ? can it be done ? &quot;
it &apos;s a very violent process that is little known .
charles fain was convicted of kidnapping , rape and murder of a young girl walking to school .
well now , how are we going to tell the good memes from the bad memes ?
many people have laid down their lives for communism , and many have laid down their lives for capitalism .
here at ted there are great opportunities .
and if that person is in need , if that person is suffering , we &apos;re automatically prepared to help . at least that &apos;s the argument .
when i was teaching at a middle school , we asked our students to build a robot from a standard technology kit .
and something really interesting happened .
and she told me — the nurses hadn &apos;t mentioned this — that she was blind , that she had been completely blind from macular degeneration for five years .
but he has huge teeth on one side of his mouth .
and also , the brine that &apos;s produced is oftentimes just pumped back out into the sea .
we take the water from the sea and we apply pressure .
now what would this mean , and how would we do it ?
we can download new diagnostics .
thanks .
now , why would someone want to build an underground park , and why in new york city ?
it &apos;s actually five separate sets shot at five different times with two different boys .
( laughter ) ( applause ) so he twisted his memory around .
notice that , at full extension , these quads are vertical .
we now have an intimate way of interacting with a machine .
you people , the church of ted , are a very optimistic community .
transparency is politics &apos; management of mistrust .
or take a farmer today .
you have to say , well , blackness of skin , you couldn &apos;t suffer just for that .
they think about how to get the weight over their feet because it &apos;s sort of natural — they carry you all day long .
friction climbing doesn &apos;t have any sort of hard positive edges .
because , as you can see , it was crescent shaped .
well i think it looks a bit like this .
that means it takes fifteen pounds of wild fish to get you one pound of farm tuna .
amazingly , it was still delicious .
so really this is a story about the audacious plans of young people with these dreams . there are many of us .
and we &apos;re working towards megawatt-scale machines that fly at 2000 feet and generate tons of clean electricity .
the smallest virus , on the other hand , is about 25 nanometers .
so we just switch off : us , governments and aid agencies .
and it was a japanese forum and imageboard .
ca : and that content is all off the board now .
and that ends with a little clip of my father , of lou , talking about something that is very dear to him , which is the accidents of life .
unfortunately it took so long that lou never saw it finished .
you &apos;ve got drones now being considered for domestic surveillance .
if they went exploring into the parents &apos; rooms , or even into the secret filing cabinets , they were punished , and told that for their own good they must never go in there again .
( laughter ) horses are so unpredictable . ( laughter )
it &apos;s the thing that distinguishes the puppet — ak : oops .
this is what happens when we confuse morality with frugality .
they &apos;re little . they &apos;re five years old .
this idea of affirmative consent comes from anti-rape activists who tell us that we need consent for every sexual act .
according to researchers at the university of new hampshire seven percent of all child pornography possession arrests are teens , sexting consensually with other teens .
and the problem is , we &apos;re still working through , from a societal standpoint , how we allow people to be available .
this first one &apos;s called &quot; &quot; the lean . &quot; &quot; and if you &apos;ve ever been in a meeting where you play sort of meeting &quot; &quot; chicken , &quot; &quot; you &apos;re sitting there , looking at the person , waiting for them to look away , and then quickly checking the device .
but our people had to do some 5,000 different mixes to get this right , to hit our targets .
we did the line install over the summer .
civil wars have made news headlines for many decades now , and ethnic conflicts in particular have been a near constant presence as a major international security threat .
diplomacy needs to be well resourced , sustained , and apply the right mix of incentives and pressures on leaders and followers .
here &apos;s some personal input i didn &apos;t expect .
and it &apos;s really safe .
and to quote a fellow security researcher , marcus ranum , he said that the united states is right now treating the internet as it would be treating one of its colonies .
privacy is nonnegotiable .
no , i &apos;ve got so many legs in here .
it &apos;s important to focus on a goal , i think , but also recognize the progression on the way there and how you &apos;ve grown as a person .
( applause )
if africa has a gift to share , it &apos;s a gift of a more collective society .
core europe around germany and france and others will still work , be functional , stable , wealthy , integrated .
so if i &apos;ve convinced you of that , i want to do two things with the rest of this talk .
and they were remarkably well preserved , morphologically just phenomenal .
and so by doing that , we can actually get all the little points that discriminate between a mammoth and an asian elephant , and what do we know , then , about a mammoth ?
does your brain have to send little painters in there ?
if there &apos;s time at the end , i &apos;ll show you the much more dramatic case .
this came out of hundreds of dives i have made , farting around in the dark using these platforms , and my impression that i saw more animals working from the submersible than i did with either of the remote-operated vehicles .
but i also felt like i saw more animals working with the tiburon than the ventana , two vehicles with the same field of view but different propulsion systems .
they go out and point a telescope at the sky , take a picture , identify what are stars and throw them away , look at the galaxies , estimate how far away they are , and plot them up .
so i &apos;m going to show you a smaller simulation .
italian tomato sauce is what ?
let &apos;s see if they congregate around certain ideas .
and we should begin by reimagining leather .
this collagen is the stuff between cells .
whole arm . shoulder disarticulation .
and it can &apos;t be done .
she sent me this , which is hysterical .
this was a good day .
and you know , we have a society , a world , that is paralyzed by fear .
i say that , for thousands of years , women have lived , exemplified , met in intimacy , the archetype of avalokitesvara , of kuan-yin , she who perceives the cries of suffering in the world .
aye , that it does .
what do i say to them ?
africa &apos;s markets are weak not only because of weak infrastructure in terms of roads and telecommunications , but also because of the virtual absence of necessary market institutions , such as market information , grades and standards , and reliable ways to connect buyers and sellers .
and this leads to very high handling costs .
one particularly dramatic case : for a couple months i actually tried dosages and chemicals typical of a man in his early 20s , and i was blown away by how my thoughts changed .
i was kind of extreme .
now i don &apos;t just mean in the field of daft macho edwardian style derring-do , but also in the fields of pancreatic cancer , there is something addictive about this , and in my case , i think polar expeditions are perhaps not that far removed from having a crack habit .
what we get from this adventure is just sheer joy , and joy , after all , is the end of life .
the swiss embassy in berlin is special .
it &apos;s a vicious circle .
so that &apos;s another way in which something quite positive can have a nasty kickback .
when banking is no longer so respectable , we lose interest in banking .
the virgin queen is sedated and then artificially inseminated using this precision instrument .
and this pinhead-sized mite crawls onto young bees and sucks their blood .
struggling to see through the dust and the smoke , you do your best to assist the wounded and then crawl to a nearby bunker .
you are a high-ranking military service member deployed to afghanistan .
was it aimed at measuring the diversity of research participants &apos; social backgrounds ?
take the estimate of glomerular filtration rate , or gfr .
and we see these amazing structures — these little knots of two colors of thread we call &quot; &quot; social hot spots . &quot; &quot; the spiral thread we call a &quot; &quot; solo hot spot . &quot; &quot; and we think that these affect the way language is learned .
we &apos;re not looking at — think of this as a dollhouse cutaway of our house .
so one of the things you can do to our icons , just like paper , is crease them and fold them , just like paper . remember , you know , something for later .
and ok , so you could sex it up and like go to a much more lickable mac , you know , but really it &apos;s the kind of same old crap we &apos;ve had for the last , you know , 30 years .
( applause )
first : &quot; john . &quot;
so i &apos;m going to show you an example now .
what you &apos;re looking at here is an image of a mouse &apos;s brain , and we &apos;ve implanted into this mouse &apos;s brain a small little tumor .
i mean it really is .
we &apos;re just not going to be able to do what they did in &quot; &quot; jurassic park . &quot; &quot; we &apos;re not going to be able to make a dinosaur based on a dinosaur .
kids need opportunities to lead and succeed .
after all , take a look at these events : imperialism and colonization , world wars , george w. bush .
and if she &apos;s doing that , because every time she crosses that target with the little cursor , she gets a drop of brazilian orange juice .
and we had a robotic device , a humanoid robot , in kyoto , japan at atr laboratories that was dreaming its entire life to be controlled by a brain , a human brain , or a primate brain .
the explanation of that paradox is that , within our societies , we &apos;re looking at relative income or social position , social status — where we are in relation to each other and the size of the gaps between us .
here we have children dropping out of high school .
and i had to overcome my fear of deep water to find this one .
these also tend to grow clonally , the oldest of which is 13,000 years old .
here &apos;s how the great persian poet rumi put it : &quot; &quot; out beyond ideas of wrong-doing and right-doing , there is a field .
i think it has relevance to any problem between people anywhere .
now to the ridicule of my colleagues , i inspired my lab to focus on what i thought was the most non-controversial source of stem cells , adipose tissue , or fat , yes fat — nowadays available in abundant supply — you and i , i think , would be very happy to get rid of anyway .
indeed , we live in both challenging as well as exciting times .
is it getting hotter or is it getting colder ?
and that &apos;s where i think organizations like ted , like the extreme ice survey can have a terrific impact on human perception and bring us along .
and we left .
and only about 17 percent are of european descent .
you don &apos;t see it all confined into that red circle .
and so what we can look forward to , or at least prepare for , is the fact that in the far future , the earth is going to look more like mars .
we play , and we &apos;re joined by her sisters , and there &apos;s a lot of laughing , and i give a dramatic reading from the book everybody poops .
well , me .
however , i soon realized that not everyone is fortunate enough to enjoy the clean water we did .
according to the world health organization , 660 million people in our world lack access to a clean water source .
so i get shipped off to private school , k through eight , public schools , but for some reason my grandfather was upset that somebody at the local high school had been stabbed and killed , so he didn &apos;t want me to go there .
they sold out of all of their books .
this is me . my name is ben saunders .
at the south pole there &apos;s a big scientific base . there &apos;s an airstrip .
you had a rebellion in the north , the government in the south — the capital , abidjan — and in the middle , the french army .
you &apos;ve read about it already .
they &apos;re not under nda either .
six months into the lawsuit , we finally reached the discovery phase .
so i &apos;m going to leave you with seven things you can do right now to improve your health with sound .
silence is beautiful .
this side of airbnb really hit home to sebastian last summer during the london riots .
now at the end of my tea with sebastian , he told me how , on a bad , rainy day , when he hasn &apos;t had a customer in his bookstore , he thinks of all the people around the world who &apos;ve said something wonderful about him , and what that says about him as a person .
not only does this add a new and potentially safer avenue for documenting abuses , it opens up the program to the growing global digital generation .
and for a lot of us , they &apos;re as close as we have yet to always-on , widely available information tools .
in rwanda , they are now getting 75 percent of their cooking fuel in their prison system from the contents of prisoners &apos; bowels .
let &apos;s talk dirty .
is it just the wind or a dangerous predator ?
woman : we &apos;re hoping we can use part of this in a national commercial , right ?
when they entered the study , all of these teenagers were interviewed .
it &apos;s also lifelong . it never ends .
and this is for a chapter that i &apos;m doing in a book , and the chapter is on honor .
so it &apos;s a little bit unexpected , but , in a way , it refers to the macaroni art that children make for their parents or they make in school and give to their parents , which is in itself a form of honor .
in our process , we basically use it as a glue .
they &apos;re basically fouling up earth &apos;s respiratory and circulatory systems .
feats of such modest valor , who would suspect them to be exercises in an intimate , fierce discipline , a metaphysics of being relentlessly aware ?
external illumination can distort , though .
thank you .
this is part of the type of innovation we want to see in the rising africa .
even though i &apos;d never mentioned her name , she sued me for defamation and invasion of privacy .
he was 35 years old .
now , i am going to show you how my bow works .
a customer from a department store across from my building called 911 , and i ran downstairs to tell my mom with half of my hair burned .
that one is a naked biped . why ?
the last exception was supposed to be the rhinoceros .
but these are temporary columns , waiting in purgatory , to be placed in the very counties where these lynchings occurred .
but as we enter , the ground drops below us and our perception shifts , where we realize that these columns evoke the lynchings , which happened in the public square .
they were desperate for volunteers because the average age of the volunteer at the hospital gift shop was 75 .
chris anderson : no , you can &apos;t start the three minutes .
the next group , 14 percent of the wealth , 21 , 22 and 32 .
what about education for young people ?
and they think it &apos;s a metaphor , but this is not a metaphor .
so the water goes up . he turns it back down . great .
and also a reduction in energy requirements in buildings by an outstanding 15 percent , because you need less fresh air .
and we need six to eight waist-high plants per person .
within a period of 60 days , his vocabulary went from two to three words to 300 words .
i &apos;d like to tell you about one such child , whose story was also covered by abc news .
the solution for that is to make roads out of porous asphalt .
here you see actually how the damage appears in this material .
for example , the calculation : can you feel where on the number line the solution is likely to fall ?
it can also mean the fibers that grow from a head .
it &apos;s being used now to track where counterfeit drugs have been made , where banknotes have come from , to look at the provenance of antiques and see that they really did come from the place the seller said they did .
if you actually didn &apos;t realize that plants have sex , they have rampant , promiscuous and really quite interesting and curious sex . really .
so you can read &quot; &quot; architecture active &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; active architecture . &quot; &quot; so this spider goes through the whole alphabet with identical adjectives and substantives .
so among them , i have been a shepherdess , a truck driver , a factory worker , a cleaning lady .
i &apos;m the center of attention .
and calvin coolidge said , &quot; &quot; no man ever listened his way out of a job . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) why do we not listen to each other ?
i hate to be invisible .
( laughter ) ( applause ) this is grace dammann .
we still clutch close these letters to our chest , to the words that speak louder than loud , when we turn pages into palettes to say the things that we have needed to say , the words that we have needed to write , to sisters and brothers and even to strangers , for far too long .
thank you . ( applause ) ( applause )
and a mother is very uncomfortable for having a girl child .
but my daughter never complained .
is it the leeches ? is it something else ?
so it &apos;s a slow process , but there is no other way .
eight minutes later , he looked from his hand to the screen , and he was browsing : he was going back and forth .
so i did this for almost five years , and this experiment really took us all the way across the length and breadth of india .
there are thousands of these blue dots all over the county .
the initial goal became using design within the public education system in partnership with dr. zullinger — that was why we were there .
he has a telephone booth .
now we had to start changing these people and converting them from using that for a livelihood , to getting something else .
but to the multipotentialites in the room , including those of you who may have just realized in the last 12 minutes that you are one — ( laughter ) to you i say : embrace your many passions .
barbara sher refers to us as &quot; &quot; scanners . &quot; &quot; use whichever term you like , or invent your own .
ha : they teach us to use machine guns , kalashnikov , rocket launchers , grenades , bombs .
he killed 28 .
there is just one reference point , which is the body .
and we could take a very simple view and say , well , it is that which we lose when we fall into deep sleep without dreams , or when we go under anesthesia , and it is what we regain when we recover from sleep or from anesthesia .
and i worry for us both if we continue down this road , me not listening , you feeling unheard , you shouting to get me to listen .
it took time for your fears to trigger my fears , not least because at first , i never thought i needed to fear you .
watch the whip of its tail as it does it . look at that .
well i &apos;m really excited today to show you the newest version of a robot , stickybot , using a new hierarchical dry adhesive .
i want you to know the room you &apos;re looking at is stark white .
so anyway , today we &apos;ll talk about architecture a little bit , within the subject of creation and optimism .
right ?
and some of them may be earth-like .
this is a spectacular picture of our home planet .
but i think to set the scene , i want to show — the next slide is not my attempt to show the worst ted slide in the history of ted , but it is a bit of a mess .
remove most of the quantitative metrics to assess performance .
is it really in their personal interest to cooperate or not , if , when they cooperate , they are individually worse off ?
it is even counterproductive .
only you can fight , can do it .
so let &apos;s start by making autos oil free .
so what do such savings mean for the electricity that is three-fifths used in motors ?
you &apos;re not earning the sort of eulogy you want , you hope someone will give to you .
i was reminded of a common response through history of how you build a solid adam ii , how you build a depth of character .
she was four years old .
what about people with anxiety issues ?
this now is the third different output .
do you want to let it loose on the internet ?
with an amazing group of women , i co-founded the libyan women &apos;s platform for peace , a movement of women , leaders , from different walks of life , to lobby for the sociopolitical empowerment of women and to lobby for our right for equal participation in building democracy and peace .
one day we wake up to the news of the desecration of ancient mosques and sufi tombs .
and i said , &quot; &quot; what &apos;s your name ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; henry . &quot; &quot; &quot; henry , what &apos;s your question ? &quot;
and i reminded myself a couple hours in , you know , the sport is sort of a microcosm of life itself .
it &apos;s the greenest building in the world .
so just bear with me . we &apos;ll go real fast , you know ?
now shivdutt was visiting the local land registry office in uttar pradesh , and he discovered that official records were listing him as dead .
thank you .
i &apos;m very proud to show you the teaser .
fishing , breeding , farming are still the world &apos;s foremost human occupations .
our artist collaborator , ross goodwin , has done experiments involving a camera that takes a picture , and then a computer in his backpack writes a poem using neural networks , based on the contents of the image .
well , then the error is 6 .
the great inequality in developing countries makes it difficult to see , for example , that in terms of transport , an advanced city is not one where even the poor use cars , but rather one where even the rich use public transport .
or bicycles : for example , in amsterdam , more than 30 percent of the population uses bicycles , despite the fact that the netherlands has a higher income per capita than the united states .
gabby &apos;s in a coma . i &apos;m in tucson .
gg : i &apos;m optimistic . it will be a long , hard haul , but i &apos;m optimistic .
and the one that i did not submit , which i still like , i wanted to use the same phrase .
one is the sort of willingness to expose myself to a critical audience , and not to suggest that i am confident about what i &apos;m doing .
wait for the man with the mockingbird . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) yeah . and then come the news crews , and the man-in-the-street interviews , and the letters to the editor .
inside it , i will place a mockingbird for — short explanation , hippie parents .
and he got , from other data sources , information to show which houses are occupied by white people .
so , today i &apos;m back just to show you a few things , to show you , in fact , there is an open data movement afoot , now , around the world .
i hadn &apos;t heard about the 10 ways that we should be afraid of the — by the way , i could have thought , i &apos;d better not do this because they say not to , you know .
( laughter ) so i started developing — you know , george &apos;s dad had a lot of help . i just had my brother .
and i &apos;m not saying that we should copy nature , i &apos;m not saying we should mimic biology , instead i propose that we can borrow nature &apos;s processes .
columns are architectural archetypes .
i grew up with this woman .
&quot; it won &apos;t upset me . why ? what ? is something wrong with him ? &quot;
because although i &apos;ve used scientific terms in songs , it &apos;s very difficult sometimes to make them lyrical .
that &apos;s what it feels like to me .
i mean , to me , it just means so much .
and i saw something extraordinary happening in silicon valley , so i wanted to be there , and i saw that the computer was coming into our homes , that it had to change in order to be with us in our homes .
i went down to a remote lagoon in australia , hoping to see the earth the way it was three billion years ago , back before the sky turned blue .
an asteroid hits , and the world went down in flames .
he did this in his phd for hundreds of pairs of drugs .
thank you very much .
it would have &quot; &quot; heart &quot; &quot; in that it would have passion and heart and soul .
and i was longing for several things that i wasn &apos;t getting , or not getting enough of .
i believe that correctly using computers is the silver bullet for making math education work .
for example : mental arithmetic .
the act of observation changes it .
it only took one robust observation from copernicus to blow that idea out of the water .
we had no exoskeleton , we had no patients , we had nothing done .
by sensorizing these devices with lots of different types of sensors , as you are going to see in a moment , we actually sent messages back to the brain to confirm that that voluntary motor will was being enacted , no matter where — next to the subject , next door , or across the planet .
and so we &apos;re bringing them back in a contemporary story for children .
and somehow kids don &apos;t do that anymore .
imagine making all of our hard materials that way .
this is a locust . there can be 80 million of them in a square kilometer , and yet they don &apos;t collide with one another .
why ?
a button , two guitar picks and lots of hot glue .
and what else can you ask someone to do but try ?
and yeah , some folks may be disappointed , but that is on them , not on you .
thank you .
we &apos;ve got you .
they &apos;re actually more realistic than healthy individuals .
that &apos;s most of us here .
they could fly in the air . they could bend their elbow all the way back .
i think of like , transformers , like how panels open and then they fold , they fold in , and then you close that panel .
religions ranged from indigenous beliefs to yoruba , muslim and christian evangelical .
doctors are concentrated in the cities , where only half the world &apos;s people live , and within cities , not in the shantytowns or south l.a.
neighbors came and went . under president adams , a local dentist happened by .
what comes the day after the arab spring ?
and it is a very weird thing , because proper nouns are the worst .
it is the only time when what comes out of my mouth is comprehensively exactly what i intended .
and that really shocked me , because i was no geek , i was no technology guy , and all the equipment needed was already there , was easily available .
but there was another conflict , the one i believe that &apos;s more important here to make my point that it was a narrative conflict .
but a nation or a state , like israel or iran or france or germany , this is just a story that we &apos;ve invented and became extremely attached to .
the real difference between humans and all other animals is not on the individual level ; it &apos;s on the collective level .
why would two women who were enjoying successful careers in investment banking in the corporate sector leave to found a financial services firm ?
the whole thing about the female trend is not about women being better than men ; it is actually about women being different from men , bringing different values and different ways to the table .
three years , four years , still smelled putrid .
when the woman is ready to deliver her child , she lies on her back , she is strapped down to the table , and the table is rotated at high speed .
now , in the 27 years since hiv was identified as the cause of aids , we &apos;ve developed more drugs to treat hiv than all other viruses put together .
now , you might think of flu as just a really bad cold , but it can be a death sentence .
i got to act in a movie with adam sandler and work with my idol , the amazing dave matthews .
i grew up watching whoopi goldberg , roseanne barr , ellen , and all of these women had one thing in common : they were comedians .
they said , &quot; &quot; well i guess there aren &apos;t that many mathematicians sitting around looking at sea slugs . &quot; &quot; and that &apos;s true . but it also goes deeper than that .
the discovery of hyperbolic space ushered in the field of mathematics that is called non-euclidean geometry .
so i &apos;m preparing to get alzheimer &apos;s disease .
( laughter ) he got dementia anyway .
you actually do see that the people who wait until the last minute are so busy goofing off that they don &apos;t have any new ideas .
that was not in the script .
you know , we had to be taught to renounce the powerful conservation ethic we developed during the great depression and world war ii .
after a year the ones from japan are heading straight across the pacific , while ours get caught in the california current and first head down to the latitude of cabo san lucas .
it can move anywhere it wants in space irrespective of where it is facing and even of how it is rotating .
( applause ) this last demonstration is an exploration of synthetic swarms .
( applause ) so that &apos;s kind of our battle cry .
and this is an amazing picture , because this is his life support system , and he &apos;s looking over his life support system .
meaning that we try , we fail , we try again , we fail faster , we fail better , we try again , we fail better again .
this one-brand-fits-all message — forget it !
we also like to innovate in our physical space , and we noticed in meetings , you know , you have to wait a long time for projectors to turn on and off , and they &apos;re noisy , so people shut them off .
but here you can see around the world how people are using google .
the surgeon looks at the son when they arrive and is like , &quot; i can &apos;t operate . &quot;
can you imagine me running one of these ?
and i will show you how we can use dogs in the fight against malaria .
ooh , that was very quick .
my generation of women fought the battles for the right to work and the right for equal pay .
nobody really expected much from people at work or in society because all the expectations then were about home and family responsibilities .
the second assumption which informs the american view of choice goes something like this .
but it is not only other people in other places that are feeling the pressure of ever-increasing choice .
this image , to me , is almost like from a shakespearean play , with a man , surrounded by various influences , desperate to hold on to something true within himself , in a context of great suffering that he has created himself .
joshua claims to have personally killed more than 10,000 people during liberia &apos;s civil war .
i love my food .
they &apos;d buy it from the shop as raw ingredients .
i have also an audible altimeter .
because you &apos;re going fast and you &apos;re up at 3,000 meters or so .
it was the largest and most realistic simulation of the growth of cosmic structure .
and the blue lines tie together the people that were present in that network year after year .
this was in the middle of the 20th century when music from the heart , beautiful music , wasn &apos;t the most popular thing in the classical music world .
it was more atonal and twelve-tone .
it &apos;s considering the implications of what this generation has to say to the rest of us .
and then , of course , to bring us to today .
we can give glucose a sensor for diabetes to prevent it .
that is , for men , 29 percent in the country over 60 have type ii diabetes , and women , although it &apos;s less , it &apos;s terribly high .
and through it all , that fierce little six-year-old has stayed with me , and she has helped me stand before you today as an unapologetic fat person , a person that simply refuses to subscribe to the dominant narrative about how i should move through the world in this body of mine .
i also receive smiles from strangers who recognize what it takes to walk down the street with a spring in your step and your head held high .
they &apos;re on the international stage .
tk : i would simplify or stylize the phoenix .
let &apos;s find a way to join the dance .
humanity takes center stage at ted , but i would like to add a voice for the animals , whose bodies and minds and spirits shaped us .
you can use , actually , scaffolds , biomaterials — they &apos;re like the piece of your blouse or your shirt — but specific materials you can actually implant in patients and they will do well and help you regenerate .
but we now have better ways to create these structures with the cells .
many of these life-forms live in unusual ways .
instead of exploring outer space , i wanted to explore the wonders of inner space .
for a hundred years , despite evidence to show that this is what they were doing , we didn &apos;t believe it .
without them , it &apos;s going to be a problem .
and he said , &quot; &quot; my gunner was throwing candy . &quot; &quot; and i knew what he was going to say .
mm : i will not go back .
honeybee robotics designed the mars driller , and it was really very much fun to work with them .
and we did a lot of media work , also a lot of experimental theater projects .
now here , i have a personal interest .
that &apos;s amazing .
birds try to stay about three or four body lengths apart .
interviewer : no . if you try and put one foot in front of another , it &apos;s moving your feet away from under you . am : yes .
that stuff &apos;s cool . &quot; &quot; walked into the lego store .
so then you realize there are these conventions .
the sculpture park in grenada was instrumental in the government designating a spot — a marine-protected area .
the site was actually listed as a &quot; &quot; wonder of the world &quot; &quot; by national geographic .
what we &apos;re trying to do , or what we believe , because this is how we believe the world really works , is that without the environment you have nothing .
so i built this small sailing robot with the rudder at the front , and i was trying to pull something very long and heavy , so that &apos;s a four-meter-long object just to pull , and i was surprised with just a 14-centimeter rudder , i could control four meters of absorbent .
so here &apos;s a group of guys on a college crew team .
others use dancing , spinning and circling to promote self-transcendence .
this is unnatural selection .
some of you occasionally might think about sex .
so now , you &apos;d expect a second peak for other reasons , but not half a millisecond later .
it &apos;s two and a half inches thick , and supported at two points .
to you and me , that &apos;s a heart attack .
sound affects us physiologically , psychologically , cognitively and behaviorally all the time .
edi is different .
say hello to edi .
maybe i &apos;m gonna lose .
i got as far as amarillo , texas , before my car broke down .
let me give you an example so that you can understand what i mean .
they &apos;re good best practices for designing at scale .
so we need tools to expand our range of acceptable behavior .
when i take your perspective , and i think about what you really want , you &apos;re more likely to give me what i really want .
now you pursue this guy , gesticulating .
because our acquisition of social learning would create a social and evolutionary dilemma , the resolution of which , it &apos;s fair to say , would determine not only the future course of our psychology , but the future course of the entire world .
so don &apos;t do that .
those are nearly extinct .
and when it &apos;s in their world , they can relate to it and play with it in a way that &apos;s fundamentally different from how they play with it on the screen .
so this is a new project .
&quot; oh , &quot; we said , &quot; full length . &quot;
he &apos;s watched all the program , and at the end station , he rises up to pick up what he thinks is his luggage , and his head hit the curtain rod , and he realized he is in his own living room .
also , we have a window of opportunity , because the brain is malleable for just so long , and that window of opportunity happens in the first three years of life .
the science is there .
and finally , she has a dermatitis on the fingers of her right hand , a dermatitis that is unique to the linoleum factory workers in burntisland . &quot; &quot; and when bell actually strips the patient , begins to examine the patient , you can only imagine how much more he would discern .
something of importance had transpired in the exchange .
and they take this stuff seriously .
these relationship skills are so easy .
i grew up in the paris suburbs and i was the youngest of three children .
and then he would not come .
and they are heterosexuals who come from countries that have traditions of polygamy and relatively high levels of female autonomy , and almost all of those countries are in east or southern africa .
except that , wait a minute , politicians are rational , too , and they &apos;re responding to what they think the voters want .
and my best friend had mistakenly one day said something about wishing he had another child .
and i said , &quot; &quot; look , i think i &apos;ll scare the grandmother to death , if i actually write to her and tell her that you &apos;re willing to adopt her , i want to go back and talk to her . &quot; &quot; but i was off on assignment .
it was met with nostalgic aunts who missed seeing my knees in the shadow of skirts , who reminded me that my kind of attitude would never bring a husband home , that i exist for heterosexual marriage and child-bearing .
i decided to be a boy .
they &apos;ve discovered a new bond , a new material for transparent solar cells .
we &apos;re working with our physicist colleagues that have given us the mathematical calculations of the n-dimensional schrödinger equation in time .
unlike an aircraft carrier or an atomic bomb , you don &apos;t need a massive manufacturing system to build robotics . a lot of it is off the shelf . a lot of it &apos;s even do-it-yourself .
it &apos;s just to give you a taste .
and the reason he was , was that len is a cold fish .
this is the most venerable of the happinesses , traditionally .
we design our world . we invent possibilities .
there are no special effects in &quot; &quot; upwake , &quot; &quot; no artifice .
you &apos;re not exactly looking for a singular fact anymore , you &apos;re looking for knowledge , which is something way more complicated and delicate .
almost 80 people died that day .
and i felt badly for not having done a good job .
that song — ( applause ) thank you .
they are raped , beaten up and sometimes killed with impunity .
my first question was , naturally , what was i going to wear ?
all of them were limited to 50 , 100 or 500 schools .
so right at the beginning of the project , what we said was , &quot; &quot; whatever we have to do has to be scalable , it has to work in all 15,000 schools . &quot; &quot; and hence , it has to work within the existing budgets and resources that the state actually has .
welcome to the performance world .
( laughter ) this is orientation hall .
so , when we did this for responses from the standard method and from our encoder and transducer .
so , a solution to the problem , then , would be to build a device that could mimic the actions of that front-end circuitry and send signals to the retina &apos;s output cells , and they can go back to doing their normal job of sending signals to the brain .
what we do is prolong people &apos;s lives , and delay death , and redirect death , but we can &apos;t , strictly speaking , save lives on any sort of permanent basis .
and she said , &quot; &quot; you matter because you are , and you matter to the last moment of your life . &quot; &quot; and i firmly believe that that &apos;s the message that we have to carry forward .
and in 2009 , i had the opportunity to visit the tepui table mountains , which are in the orinoco and amazon basins .
thank you .
play — play is a key part of my scientific practice .
and then we grew cells on them .
but they were random things .
and i testified to that inquiry in secret .
the polls , however , told a very different story .
thank you .
i put on my ipod , i listened to some music , i got myself as aggressive as possible — but controlled aggression — and then i hurled myself into that water .
and i firmly believe that what we &apos;re seeing in the himalayas is the next great , big battleground on this earth .
we think of it as maybe too silly , too unnecessary .
every season , these designers have to struggle to come up with the new fabulous idea that everybody &apos;s going to love .
i had a kid one day come into my class having been stabbed the night before .
like , i remember one day i found my dad convulsing , foaming at the mouth , od-ing on the bathroom floor .
that evening , i came home to hundreds of hate mails , hundreds of people telling me how they could have lived another day without seeing this .
i started doing fashion .
one of the most common ones is happiness and pleasure .
this is from marlboro country .
she &apos;s the trivial pursuit queen , if you want , but when she first gets her power , she starts going on game shows and making money .
dr. razem : it &apos;s time to go , miklos .
you slam them together , and if we are right , some of the energy of that collision will go into debris that flies off into these extra dimensions .
you know , the force responsible for electricity and magnetic attraction and so forth .
finally , very recently , we were able to track down a dig site where a local fossil hunter found several bones of spinosaurus .
and we were able to reconstruct it .
it &apos;s starting to be a little bit more specified .
we tended towards longer-term things and also things that people can reuse and make into new movies , which has just been great fun .
correct horse battery staple . &quot; &quot; so we did the research study to see what would actually happen .
so some people had a pretty easy policy , we call it basic8 , and here the only rule was that your password had to have at least eight characters .
and so i started to look at what the marketing looked like .
there are many health issues as well .
the notion of violent jihad in which more muslims are killed than any other kind of people is already thoroughly discredited .
any claim that al qaeda had to being protectors of islam against the western crusaders was drowned in the blood of iraqi muslims .
all our memories are reconstructed memories .
so all the light in this area from the sun and the moon is what you see on the screen right here .
that &apos;s another piece .
this is all very good . this is all great .
but the distance from the poorest here , the very poorest , to the very richest over here is wider than ever .
so the only way of really getting world population &#91; growth &#93; to stop is to continue to improve child survival to 90 percent .
four years ago , 23 african countries came together to create the great green wall sahara .
so , we get climate change .
seen from the outside , i live outside of germany , and i expected the germans to react much more strongly , immediately .
so hubertus , i want to ask you a couple of questions because i have here der spiegel from last week .
a , b or c ? please answer .
then , i will equip you with some tricks for beating the chimps in the future .
this is a full set of encyclopedias that &apos;s been connected and sanded together , and as i carve through it , i &apos;m deciding what i want to choose .
i &apos;m just carving around whatever i find interesting .
people who got infections either recovered , if they were lucky , or they died .
two days after that , he spiked a fever .
he said , &quot; &quot; mr. veitch , i &apos;m not responsible for anything you have ordered . &quot; &quot; i said , &quot; &quot; let &apos;s not get into who did what .
let &apos;s do something anyway !
a discovery is made , that discovery is instantly seen in the command center a second later .
you don &apos;t have enough gaming experience .
( laughter ) all right . so what happened ?
it was literally you push a button and get an s-class .
if jenipher wants credit , her options are limited .
but one day , jenipher &apos;s son convinced her to download our application and apply for a loan .
the first one is the school extension , of course .
in my culture , this is a symbol of deep affection .
he tasted it and fell in love with it .
what &apos;s natural about foie gras ?
in mesoamerica , there used to be neurosurgery , and there were these neurosurgeons that used to treat patients .
so what i &apos;m going to tell you about is using the circuitry of the brain to implant electrodes and turning areas of the brain up and down to see if we can help our patients .
they &apos;re physically putting their bodies on the line between the whalers &apos; harpoons and the whales .
they just made it up .
the hurdy-gurdy has been used , historically , through the centuries in mostly dance music because of the uniqueness of the melody combined with the acoustic boombox here .
now , since this is tedglobal , who can tell me what this is called in french ?
that &apos;s what opportunity-makers do .
so what i &apos;m asking you is , the world is hungry .
please meet the minds and hands of my students .
we printed its surface out of 44 different properties , varying in rigidity , opacity and color , corresponding to pressure points on the human body .
somi .
josh .
welcome to your global farm .
what would that change about quality of life and nutrition ?
but it &apos;s not a perfect world , and your administration isn &apos;t getting us any closer . &quot; &quot; but we have trouble accessing our outcomes .
and what did we do home alone ?
people have ridden seven million miles .
this is a picture of times square in the &apos; 50s , and despite all of the technological innovation , cultural changes , political changes , this is times square in 2008 .
anyone can become a bitcoin miner .
money isn &apos;t anything objective .
so it &apos;s getting precarious .
ca : thirty percent a year . ms : but then beekeepers are able to divide their colonies and so they can maintain the same number , they can recuperate some of their loss .
so , how would we make it ?
for a moment they become helium 5 , because they &apos;ve got five particles inside them .
and it works in a very particular way .
the computer was cracked open .
he &apos;s also 12 . he &apos;s a wonderful kid .
and research shows that when kids have a consistent , nutritious breakfast ,
the best people on our blog are going to come and talk to you and try and — i want to get more on this that we could share along with the talk.as : wonderful .
now , large herds dung and urinate all over their own food , and they have to keep moving , and it was that movement that prevented the overgrazing of plants , while the periodic trampling ensured good cover of the soil , as we see where a herd has passed .
that process is a quite simple process .
she lifted her head up , and i saw her face , said hello , and then i immediately noticed something across the bridge of her nose , a crease in her skin .
so , they became this very physical , simple reappropriation , or like a portal to these other icons .
we &apos;ll be reading or eating or knitting .
we now know this transition is the one time that dinosaurs actually went below that body size — we &apos;re going to see where they began in a minute — and it is the one time that they rapidly invaded all the habitats i just told you that dinosaurs weren &apos;t in .
an amazing record of the colonization of the sahara 5,000 years ago is been sitting out there waiting for us to go back . so , really exciting .
so this provides some of the data that autism is genetic .
in fact , the current estimates are that there are 200 to 400 different genes that can cause autism .
now this is one of my plans . this is what i want to do .
a warrant for planting food on a piece of land that you could care less about ? &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) and i was like , &quot; &quot; cool . bring it . &quot; &quot; because this time it wasn &apos;t coming up .
this book was published in 1904 .
now , the good news is that we have conserved .
and you can see on the top that cancers which are bad show insertions or deletions .
but about , oh , 15 months after i got to cambridge , a rumor began to appear from linus pauling &apos;s son , who was in cambridge , that his father was now working on dna .
but each bag we &apos;d sell would provide a year &apos;s worth of school meals for one kid .
and i got from global security policy to food because i realized when i &apos;m hungry , i &apos;m really pissed off , and i &apos;m assuming that the rest of the world is too .
we entered homes and schools and universities , even mosques .
it turns out , it does a little , but not a lot .
cheers .
and i turned to the web to see if there might be some clues .
one , he opened our eyes to a completely new world .
so he lashed together a microscope in his friend &apos;s living room .
well , chances are i &apos;ve got a droid who &apos;s picking up the phone , &quot; yes , they called , and they said they didn &apos;t like it . &quot;
here &apos;s how you mail your letter .
so these types of examples , today there are just a few of them , but i think in the next decade they will become commonplace .
it will be able to reveal new trends in our history , sometimes to explain them , and maybe even in the future to predict what &apos;s going to happen .
what about germany ?
the presentations were all very exciting and very promising ; they have multiple reactors that they &apos;re working on .
ca : so here &apos;s a couple of beautiful girls from your country .
ca : so certainly this is just a picture of fragility there .
so if i take this salt dough , again , it &apos;s like the play-dough you probably made as kids , and i plug it in — it &apos;s a two-lead battery pack , simple battery pack , you can buy them at radio shack and pretty much anywhere else — we can actually then light things up .
well it &apos;s 150 times more resistant to electric current than that salt dough .
you , like the people that are trapped in my work — ( blender noises , laughter ) — have become part of my work as well . ( laughter ) ( laughter ) ( applause ) but , but this seems a bit unfair , right ?
these , to me , are like living sculptures , right , that you can go and look at , and they memorialize a specific point of time in this animal &apos;s life .
what would such a future look like ?
students can use this as a tool to learn about the complex concepts such as planetary motion , physics , and unlike computer screens or textbooks , this is a real , tangible experience that you can touch and feel , and it &apos;s very powerful .
this was my first sunburn .
we want to sustain things that are gone or things that are not the way they were .
and i &apos;m not talking here about just experts who are telling you what you &apos;re seeing , but really people who are passionate about the various nooks and crannies of the universe , who can share their enthusiasm and can make the universe a welcoming place .
but until now , our view of the universe has been disconnected and fragmented , and i think that many of the marvelous stories that nature has to tell us have fallen through the cracks . and that &apos;s changing .
now , this wasn &apos;t just about adventure .
this particular animal actually circled for 31 full days during our mission .
when you eat like a primate , you can &apos;t afford both .
so , a rodent brain with 86 billion neurons would weigh 36 kilos .
so we decided to see if flies could be provoked into showing the kind of behavior that you see by the proverbial wasp at the picnic table , you know , the one that keeps coming back to your hamburger the more vigorously you try to swat it away , and it seems to keep getting irritated .
whether the same thing is true in adhd in humans we don &apos;t know , but these kinds of results should at least cause us to consider that possibility .
( drum ) ( laughter ) so there we go , so that &apos;s one of many instruments in the laptop orchestra .
i want to talk to you about one thing and just one thing only , and this has to do with when people ask me , what do you do ?
mark zuckerberg , a journalist was asking him a question about the news feed .
what we &apos;re seeing is more of a passing of the torch from human gatekeepers to algorithmic ones .
tell us a couple of things .
bg : the man who is going to appear onstage momentarily , and vincent &apos;s going to introduce him , is one of the subjects of one of his past videos .
but the performance itself was how the musicians worked their fingers , and what instruments they were using .
not being the musicians — the listeners , right ?
i &apos;m not perfect , but what i am is optimistic , because i don &apos;t just get hate mail .
i care about two things .
and you can see , he &apos;s not trying to bite .
why do they do that ? because it &apos;s cheaper , because they don &apos;t pay the real environmental costs .
i might wish , honestly , that i had more hair here , instead of baldness .
and i think part of the problem that we have is that all of this trend , this revolution in genetic modification applying to humans , the public hasn &apos;t known about it .
if i asked you to take a match and light it and hold up a log and try to get that log to go on fire , it doesn &apos;t happen , right ? we all know that .
almost half of our greenhouse gases are related to the building industry , and if we look at energy , it &apos;s the same story .
how all of you feel is going to determine exactly how innovative we can be .
i mean , i can use profane words like &quot; &quot; shit &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; piss , &quot; &quot; and then my grandma won &apos;t watch the video .
but a second way to crack the code is to develop some technology , an interface to do two-way communication , and that &apos;s what we &apos;ve been trying to do in the bahamas and in real time .
they &apos;ve got better things to do in the wild .
( applause )
and this is the big difference .
there was a big watson logo in the middle of the stage .
that means between now and late 2014 , we will generate as much information , in terms of gigabytes , as all of humanity has in all the previous millenia put together .
for me , the world is veering towards a future we don &apos;t much want when we really think about it deep inside .
murali krishna comes from one of those villages .
and the tiny water crystals here now look for all the world like they are frozen droplets of salty water , which is a discovery that suggests that not only do the jets come from pockets of liquid water , but that that liquid water is in contact with rock .
and at that time two years ago i mentioned that we were speculating that these jets might in fact be geysers , and erupting from pockets or chambers of liquid water underneath the surface , but we weren &apos;t really sure .
children are not adults .
those of you like me who have asthma , when you take your inhaler , we can explore how that drug comes into your lungs , how it enters the body , how it might affect , say , your heart .
or political corruption in sarawak , malaysia , which has led to the destruction of much of its forests .
there is such an opportunity right now .
gas is a similar issue . gas is also a biological product . and as you think of gas , well , you &apos;re familiar with gas . and here &apos;s a different way of mining coal .
any place you see a differential , there &apos;re some interesting questions . there &apos;s some questions as to what you should be doing with this stuff . but again , coal . maybe the same stuff , maybe the same system , maybe bioenergy , and you &apos;re applying exactly the same technology .
once ? twice ? seventeen times ?
( laughter ) that &apos;s one small step for a man , one giant leap for awesome !
it &apos;s like &quot; &quot; eureka &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; bingo &quot; &quot; had a baby .
this is the kind of fact i would have loved as a boy .
time for a quick show of hands .
he was infected with hiv .
so what it actually does , it locks these strands , which are called fluxons , and it locks these fluxons in place .
so , this is quantum locking — actually locking — three-dimensional locking of the superconductor .
at this point , he was told by his doctors that he had about 3 months to live .
the first group received second-line chemotherapy , which is expected to double the life expectancy , versus no treatment at all .
&quot; say , did you hear about jimmy ? he had a stroke . &quot;
the doctor &apos;s office is only a place that you go when you don &apos;t feel well .
but instead the entire team creates a shared mental model that they can all agree on and move forward on .
secondly , making them interactive .
so citizen scientists , makers , dreamers — we must prepare the next generation that cares about the environment and people , and that can actually do something about it .
so we packed this prototype of a sensor , and we shipped it to bangladesh .
there &apos;s something like 80 coastal countries .
the fishery comes back .
( applause )
thank you very much .
and so we need to do better at copying their natural environment to get them to thrive .
may none of your non-cancer cells become endangered species .
they are tested and accredited according to international mine action standards , just like dogs have to pass a test .
to conclude , i would actually like to say , you may think this is about rats , these projects , but in the end it is about people .
so what have we learned to date ?
yet despite this intimacy , my laptop had absolutely no idea how i was feeling .
these are places where mosquitos breed .
most malarious societies throughout history have simply lived with the disease .
and that turned right away into another project .
and it &apos;s not based on an a priori notion .
it has to support over 100 million users at any given moment . it &apos;s got to be robust to attack , including closing the main index , injecting malicious files , armed seizure of some major nodes . you &apos;d say that would take years .
but what we &apos;re seeing now is the emergence of this fourth system of social sharing and exchange .
the implications are huge .
ok . i want you to close your eyes .
so the question is : what do we do next ?
and a lot of the good news comes from that part of the bridge that we are trying to build as well .
how wide would the verge have to be for that to work out ?
so , let &apos;s now say why this is relevant .
but let me first talk a little more about that nasa mission .
so doing this mission , i really started thinking more deeply about our future in outer space .
ask questions when you order seafood .
people prefer something fresh and healthy that they can trust over something that comes from far away that they know nothing about .
hell no .
thank you .
so , i imagined a very simple gestural dance that would be between a machine and just a very simple chair , and ...
when i &apos;m making these pieces , i &apos;m always trying to find a point where i &apos;m saying something very clearly and it &apos;s very simple , but also at the same time it &apos;s very ambiguous .
so some philosophers thought we were irredeemably selfish .
those could be personal challenges .
and it &apos;s the only college where we don &apos;t give a certificate .
he knows more about solar than anyone i know anywhere in the world guaranteed .
tree .
two suns together , prosperous .
to study — to understand the problem better , i undertook a year-long research to study the lack of awareness about menstruation and the root cause behind it .
during my research , i was collecting a lot of stories .
so if the united states removes a million dollars &apos; worth of lobsters from a reef , kiribati gets 50,000 dollars .
and then over to the east we have the line islands .
( laughter ) ( applause ) hp : okay . so this imitation business does come with risk .
he talks like this now .
( laughter ) so the question is , why are so many people so wrong about something so important ? i think there are a number of reasons .
as evidence of how low our behavior can sink , rather than how high our standards have risen .
in seeking and identifying employees with high potential , the potential to go to the top of organizations , the skills and competencies that relate to that green box are rated twice as heavily as those in the other two elements of leadership .
well , tonya is a great example of one of these women .
thank you .
these jetted , earth-pointed , hyperactive and supermassive black holes are called blazars , or blazing quasars .
no .
but this is not about any one organization .
( laughter ) huh ? maybe google would hire this .
take the money ; go to amazon ; buy a phonebook for a country you &apos;ve never been to — call folks at random until you find someone who flirts really well in a foreign language .
with a brain the size of a peanut , they maintain individualized , long-term social bonds , we didn &apos;t know that was possible .
in a way , collaboration is another example of a complex system .
from a register of togetherness , of belonging , architecture became a way of differentiation , and communities started drifting apart from the very fabric that used to unite them , and from the soul of the place that used to represent their common existence .
yes , prior to the war , almost half of the syrian population lived in slums , peripheral areas without proper infrastructure , made of endless rows of bare block boxes containing people , people who mostly belonged to the same group , whether based on religion , class , origin or all of the above .
the day she came to power she was challenged : just do one thing .
love triumphs .
you &apos;ll discover compassion and also slowly a relative compassion , and slowly , perhaps if you get the right teaching , you &apos;ll discover compassion is a dynamic manifestation of the reality of yourself , which is oneness , wholeness , and that &apos;s what you are .
you cannot be a part of wholeness and still be whole .
oddly enough , an artist such as myself finds herself also in the position of being the voice , the speaker of my people , even if i have , indeed , no access to my own country .
that is our regime , our government — our atrocious government , &#91; that &#93; has done every crime in order to stay in power .
do you remember what the critics said when &quot; &quot; brave &quot; &quot; came out ?
another thing that &apos;s really unique about &quot; &quot; the wizard of oz &quot; &quot; to me is that all of the most heroic and wise and even villainous characters are female .
man , we were only 10 , but we knew that made gunpowder .
no running water , no electricity . a wonderful , wonderful guy .
as hubert was talking over lunch , as we sort of engaged in conversation , talked about this , talked about cities .
so really , retranslating that technology and developing something which was so clean , it was virtually pollution-free .
and since what &apos;s impossible is always unknown , it allows me to believe i can cheat the impossible .
you don &apos;t want me to juggle , right ?
so we &apos;ve made an ultrasensitive cancer detector .
ok , but how do i get this activated signal to the outside world , where i can act on it ?
thank you .
see ? they have done it .
they pin a medal on his chest . he goes home to a ticker tape parade .
they send him to iraq .
and in that time we prototyped and built , in about three days , a system that would allow anybody with a mobile phone to send in information and reports on what was happening around them .
take the crowd and apply them to the information .
this is one of the latest issues of the economist — &quot; &quot; editing humanity . &quot; &quot; it &apos;s all about genetic enhancement , it &apos;s not about therapeutics .
imagine that these white mice differ from their pigmented litter-mates by just a tiny change at one gene in the entire genome , and they &apos;re otherwise completely normal .
and third is that we need to look at ocean-basin-wide management .
instead , they just make me green with envy that my colleague from iucn was able to go on this journey to the south of madagascar seamounts to actually take photographs and to see these wondrous creatures of the deep .
and to me , again , photography was a way in which i could explore and research the world , and find those places .
and together they only form about 15 years of supply .
and by me cutting out the middle man and giving it straight to you , the information that the fbi has has no value , so thus devaluing their currency .
he : well it goes to the last point that i was at .
i remember the very first time i went to a nice restaurant , a really nice restaurant .
but if you think of where i &apos;m from , in the south , in appalachia , in southern ohio , it &apos;s very unlikely that kids like that will rise .
( laughter ) and so when i make these things , it &apos;s really not so much about the object itself , but rather the negative space around the object .
( laughter ) so i make other hats as well .
what is the relevance of marx &apos;s analysis today ?
( applause ) bruno giussani : yanis ...
but the genes in these cavefishes can also tell us about deep geological time , maybe no more so than in this species here .
and so they give us , through their dna , this precise model and measure of how to date and time these ancient geological events .
the brain could only change within certain set limits .
normally , acquiring moral behavior is simply part of growing up , like learning to speak .
imagine your last hamburger .
if you want to take it to the next level , remember , the major culprits in terms of environmental damage and health are red and processed meats .
five years ago , i was a ph.d. student living two lives .
you have to stay focused on a 50-centimeter target from over 600 miles away while moving at more than seven kilometers a second , which requires an awesome degree of complexity .
but i actually don &apos;t think that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do .
so this is a time of great flourishing , and the more i look around , the more convinced i become that this quote , from the physicist freeman dyson , is not hyperbole at all .
i have to get out of here actually . i have to go read .
i &apos;d like to tell you that &apos;s not the case .
lighting in practice is placing lights inside this three-dimensional world .
this moment never gets old , especially for that little seven-year-old girl that wanted to be an artist .
and then i made great progression to the point where i could walk around the house , holding onto the walls , like this , and mom said she was forever following me , wiping off my fingerprints . ( laughter ) but at least she always knew where i was .
so raise your straws if you &apos;ll join me .
now think about the impact that this is going to have on our daily lives .
so when i was born , i guess you could say expectations were kind of high for me .
i &apos;m even more of a fan of globalization .
in the 1970s , the one percent accounted for about 10 percent of the national income in the united states .
( applause )
have you seen changes ?
it &apos;s called the other car .
then we lost our economy and we went back down to 47 — sometimes it &apos;s 40 , sometimes it &apos;s 50 .
ok , and then just through my skin a tiny bit , and then out the other side like this .
i say i &apos;m going to grab hold of my wrist to make sure nothing goes up or down my sleeve , that is a lie .
these initiatives cost less than a missile , and certainly less than any soldier &apos;s life , but more importantly , it takes the war to their homelands , and not onto our shore , and we &apos;re looking at the causes .
we &apos;ve mentioned the health , but it needs consumers to buy into it .
so that really got my attention , and we started to work on this nearly around the clock , because i thought , &quot; &quot; well , we don &apos;t know what the target is .
when we started our research on stuxnet six months ago , it was completely unknown what the purpose of this thing was .
when we first met , she was barely able to write her name .
i saw how she was longing to gain control over her simple daily routines , small details that we take for granted , from counting money at the market to helping her kids in homework .
we assume they do , and we expect them to read our minds .
with a stranger , we have to start from scratch .
because they are actually the same thing .
one of them creates , perhaps , the primary product — the thing we think we &apos;re paying for — the other one creates a context within which we can enjoy and appreciate that product .
ultimately , the goal , once we understand how these subtle effects can change our decision making , we want to be able to provide people tools so that they can consciously make themselves better savers and more conscious investors in their own future .
yes , because i just told you , we actually collect a lot of health data as economists .
again , it &apos;s noisy . they &apos;re playing for dancers .
i think pop music , mainly , it &apos;s written today , to some extent , is written for these kind of players , for this kind of personal experience where you can hear extreme detail , but the dynamic doesn &apos;t change that much .
ordinary people live life against the law , and that &apos;s what i — we are doing to our kids .
and in a democracy , we ought to be able to do better .
you have the roman , the greek and the story as you know it .
as a sideline , you know that the only red flag that popped up here was a submarine from an unnamed country that planted a red flag at the bottom of the arctic to be able to control the oil resources .
government does create prosperity and growth , by creating the conditions that allow both entrepreneurs and their customers to thrive .
so here &apos;s an idea for a new kind of economics , a new kind of politics that i call new capitalism .
and we said , wonderful ! look at this pretty structure .
so for various reasons , we took this oncogene , attached it to a blue marker , and we injected it into the embryos .
gandhi , too , was a real flawed human being .
stories like this , signs like this , are practical tools in a world longing to bring compassion to abundant images of suffering that can otherwise overwhelm us .
change the fables and change the markets .
do you get less sweet porridge if you invest in shade-grown coffee instead of drinking it ?
it &apos;s so rare in american culture , there &apos;s so little that &apos;s vocational about it anymore , to look at what doggedness looks like with this level of exactitude , what it means to align your body posture for three hours in order to hit a target , pursuing a kind of excellence in obscurity .
it &apos;s a wisdom understood by duke ellington , who said that his favorite song out of his repertoire was always the next one , always the one he had yet to compose .
but the choice that we don &apos;t have is a no climate change future .
our infrastructure has not been designed to cope with this .
he said , &quot; &quot; china and australia are currently enjoying a relationship of unprecedented closeness . &quot; &quot; and i thought to myself , &quot; &quot; that sounds clumsy . that sounds odd .
something had happened in the hearts of these people in australia .
in karaoke bars , there are always people who sing &quot; she &apos;s gone &quot; or &quot; hotel california , &quot; miming the guitar riffs .
this is picasso &apos;s .
thanks to chernobyl , we get asylum in the u.s.
once upon a time , scarlet was used as bait in dog fights .
they created this barrier between us and the surf , and we had to weave through this thing like a maze just to get out into the lineup .
and then the temperature began to drop .
i feel that way . i try my best .
they read to extend their knowledge , consult with colleagues or domain experts , try out new strategies , solicit feedback and reflect .
why is that ?
and one of the reasons they do that is that they turn users into producers , consumers into designers .
it &apos;s always reminded me of the apollo image of the earth , the blue marble picture , and it &apos;s similarly meant to suggest , i think , that we can &apos;t really understand it as a whole .
and then the process on shore takes around three or four days , and then , when it &apos;s done , they put the manhole cover back on top , and they push the sand over that , and we all forget about it .
how much paint are you going to use , and how many people are you going to employ ?
how about we do this whole hill now ?
but what if we could do the same thing with our ability to hear ?
well , let &apos;s say that those leaves move by just a single micrometer , and let &apos;s say that that shifts our image by just a thousandth of a pixel .
( applause )
they &apos;re all on their way back underground now .
i tivo stuff on my piece-of-junk time warner dvr all the time .
it &apos;s because they wanted to be first .
i do . i was a young boy , and my grandfather had just died , and i remember a few days later lying in bed at night trying to make sense of what had happened .
twice as likely .
this uses 20 times less energy for every mile or kilometer that you travel than a car , which means not only is this thing fast to charge and really cheap to build , but it also reduces the footprint of your energy use in terms of your transportation .
but when i say the word electric vehicle , people think about vehicles . they think about cars and motorcycles and bicycles , and the vehicles that you use every day .
finally , in part three , i &apos;m going to describe a cosmological theory called inflation , which will pull all the pieces of the story together .
maybe explaining this number is just a technical issue , a technical detail of interest to experts , but of no relevance to anybody else .
if you look up , and you pay attention to the sky , you &apos;ll see them sooner or later , maybe not quite as dramatic as these , but you &apos;ll see them .
what about rarer ones , like the lenticularis , the ufo-shaped lenticularis cloud ?
yes ! the rays would lie on a — i &apos;d like to see — yeah , on a cone .
now , suppose i put in the middle a cluster of galaxies — and don &apos;t forget the dark matter , ok .
there was a housing collapse , an auto industry collapse , and the population had plummeted by 25 percent between 2000 and 2010 , and many people were beginning to write it off , as it had topped the list of american shrinking cities .
so while detroit might not be what it was , detroit will not die .
right , the t &amp; a network . then it bought miramax , known for its nc-17 fare , and all of a sudden , families everywhere couldn &apos;t really trust what they were getting from disney .
now , there may be more or less natural or artificial stimuli for the experience , but even that is a matter of degree , not kind .
and this is the way in which living materials make the most of their local resources in a sustainable way .
we don &apos;t just want limestone dumped everywhere in all the pretty canals .
that was a trip .
so that may seem crazy , but actually , we humans do this all the time .
it was the greed and recklessness that led to the drilling explosion .
it had no limits . it was invincible .
it &apos;s about the size of a rugby ball .
and as you can see , it &apos;s been knocked about a bit , which is not surprising because it was made two and a half thousand years ago and was dug up in 1879 .
bread is not only standard in the western diet .
understand that you are part of this enormous chain of events .
what it means is that blood vessels are everywhere inside us , not just under the surface of our skin .
and when all the cars are driverless and connected , everything is predictable and reaction time , minimum .
so i marveled for a moment , and then decided it was time to release him , so i put him down .
and octopus are , they live in all the oceans .
at the biology and the built environment center , we carried out a study in a hospital where we sampled air and pulled the dna out of microbes in the air .
it matters because the health care industry is the second most energy intensive industry in the united states .
let me give you just a story , an example .
how could we possibly go to the balcony ?
when i started this organization , i was 17 years old .
and we save people that otherwise would not be saved .
but the thing that really makes this awesome is the data .
and they found things like , when you see crystal meth on the street , if you add police presence , you can curb the otherwise inevitable spate of assaults and robberies that would happen .
these dna machines are wonderful .
isn &apos;t that mind-blowing ?
( applause ) thanks a lot . ( applause )
you know death , and so may wake each morning pulsing with ready life .
and the immune system is more active .
it &apos;s the same age , but it &apos;s not in the nursing home ; it &apos;s going skiing .
( applause ) so what is it that makes some groups obviously more successful and more productive than others ?
now , we aren &apos;t really used to talking about this , about talent , about creativity , in this way .
we import 50,000 metric tons of sugar from brazil and cuba .
each local government is organized like the central government — a bureaucracy , a cabinet , a parliament , and so many jobs for the political hangers-on .
cyber espionage is spiriting away advanced designs to parts unknown , and in that environment , it is very likely that a successful drone design will be knocked off in contract factories , proliferate in the gray market .
and this is why we need an international treaty on robotic weapons , and in particular a global ban on the development and deployment of killer robots .
every one of our votes matters .
there are over 500,000 local and state offices in america .
you have weekly reviews . you &apos;re constantly changing .
be flexible , be open-minded , let the best ideas win .
and they are taking over sweden , and they are now healthier than sweden .
it &apos;s a cultural expression that for thousands of years has inspired human beings to think beyond the obvious .
what about athens ? mediterranean climate , but in the sun it was not comfortable . they didn &apos;t perceive comfort .
together with the architects of albert speer &amp; partner , our engineers from transsolar have been supporting , have been developing open-air stadia based on 100 percent solar power , on 100 percent solar cooling .
this was the big leagues — this was costuming mecca .
( laughter ) this is a paper-thin shark face and a vinyl bib with the poster of &quot; &quot; jaws &quot; &quot; on it . ( laughter )
because i believe that the key to getting the most from choice is to be choosy about choosing .
my fourth technique : condition for complexity .
i had to acknowledge that i had hurt others .
but i also had to apologize to myself .
( applause ) ( video ) man : how are you doing ?
and there we go .
my dysfunctional self could actually plug in to another self , not my own , and it felt so good .
the self that i attempted to take out into the world was rejected over and over again .
these moons , which are not in what we call a traditional habitable zone , that are out in the solar system , have liquid water .
actually almost the size of our black sea in some places .
( laughter ) finally , oysters can attenuate and agglomerate onto each other and form these amazing natural reef structures .
when we started this project , one of the core ideas was to look back in history and try to understand what was there .
this is only virtual reality , v.r.
how do we get to augmented reality , a.r. ?
i &apos;m really clear about how young people feel when you talk to them about this idea of having a starting point for their actions for a more peaceful world through their poetry , their art , their literature , their music , their sport , whatever it might be .
and i said to him , &quot; &quot; mr. brahimi , is this nuts , going for a global truce ?
i met jim and shirley in their 80s .
i &apos;ve put worksheets online , so if you &apos;d like , you can plan your own end .
then because the relationship between the retail is destroyed , we pop a handicapped ramp on that , and then to make ourselves feel better , we put a nature band-aid in front of it .
the public realm in america has two roles : it is the dwelling place of our civilization and our civic life , and it is the physical manifestation of the common good .
satellites in high orbits like these could remain there for centuries .
it &apos;s up to us to keep it that way .
so how can you live little ?
( applause )
this is just a photo of one of my three-dimensional paintings .
you may want to take a closer look .
i was experimenting with these — i don &apos;t know if you can see it — but there &apos;s a work surface there .
very advanced , no air-conditioning — i love it .
they &apos;re known to be man-eaters .
introduce technology to the contacted tribes , not the uncontacted tribes , in a culturally sensitive way .
well , from there , unfortunately , in 2004 , the project came to a halt . many political reasons .
well , our vision is to rediscover the spirit of the renaissance , create a new discipline where engineering for cultural heritage is actually a symbol of blending art and science together .
the cool thing about the t-mobile phones is that although switching technologies is very advanced , the billing technology has not caught up .
( laughter ) google : bagels , monterey , california .
you won &apos;t be alone . thank you . ( applause ) ( applause )
it &apos;s just fabulous . ( laughter ) also , the way i dress has changed .
watson was in fact listening to very low-frequency radio emissions caused by nature .
it &apos;s 1964 , and we &apos;re back at bell labs .
seven different salts .
look at her posture ; it &apos;s remarkable .
who needed , who had to have the information so that they could do the important parts of the job that you needed ?
we bled , we died , and we killed to stop that organization from the violence that they were putting largely against the iraqi people .
congrats , cyril . great stuff . oh wow .
but , actually , it doesn &apos;t tag it as gold .
( applause ) ca : so you copied — you exactly copied the design in the book .
ca : and you made it out of what ?
and the estimate is that in 2050 , there &apos;ll be three billion squatters , better than one in three people on earth .
the issue is not the larger , over-arching thing .
let me explain what that is .
you have a seven-digit number , call out any six of them please .
now , official figures reveal that figure to be about five .
( laughter ) it &apos;s the part of mathematics that even mathematicians don &apos;t particularly like , because whereas the rest of maths is all about precision and certainty , statistics is almost the reverse of that .
we had joy . you were laughing , smiling . look at your faces . this room is full of joy .
this is called the death star configuration .
local tv news looms large , and unfortunately only dedicates 12 percent of its coverage to international news .
the reality is that covering britney is cheaper .
and yes , technology disruption is not only a big deal in software and electronics .
every small entrepreneurial company naturally thinks and acts biologically .
so if we want to utilize self-assembly in our physical environment , i think there &apos;s four key factors .
one of them is the input from the user , as you &apos;re building your bricks .
if you could start to move that , to identify what you &apos;re up against , you &apos;re going to do things a hell of a lot better .
and i &apos;m a firm believer , in the field of medicine and especially cancer , that it &apos;s going to be a broad platform of technologies that will help us move forward and hopefully help patients in the near-term .
and what happens when we get curious ?
trigger , behavior , reward .
and the first of these is perhaps surprising .
well , we really ought to talk about armpits , and i have to say that i do have particularly good ones .
when her father saw her and saw who she had become , in her full girl self , he threw his arms around her and broke down crying .
there is a girl who i met 14 years ago in afghanistan who i have adopted as my daughter because her mother was killed . her mother was a revolutionary .
it reminds us that we are a part of nature , and we &apos;re not separate from it .
( applause ) thank you . ( applause )
we &apos;re trying to prevent an impact .
does it predict human-level intelligence ?
and so i did things like travel to south africa , where i had an opportunity to understand how nelson mandela was ahead of his time in anticipating and navigating his political , social and economic context .
they see around corners , shaping their future , not just reacting to it .
so we did find that corexit 9500 contains heavy metals , arsenic and chromium — arsenic at high enough levels to have cancer-causing effects .
but it did pass .
technology and innovation behaves a lot like wealth and capital .
thank you .
but psychographics really haven &apos;t had a huge impact on the media business .
i think that social media is actually going to help us dismantle some of the silly and demeaning stereotypes that we see in media and advertising about gender .
we visited not only with prosecutors but with legislators , with inmates in our state and local prisons .
action &apos;s my witness .
they grow in tropical forests like this one and they also grow in temperate rainforests , that we find in washington state .
these canopy communities are fragile .
or a jazz poster with a happy face and a more aggressive face .
so it &apos;s : &quot; &quot; trying to look good limits my life . &quot; &quot; and then we did one more of these .
in that dilemma lies the central problem of democracy .
they get things done .
i brought some for her parents .
others think it &apos;s too much dietary fat .
so organizing these markets is one thing we try to do .
( laughter ) we &apos;re now working with partners in health and the ministry of health in rwanda and our foundation folks to scale this system up .
ld : there was just one problem .
so he decided to run for senate .
here &apos;s what it feels like for me : i am instantly an internal storm of contrasting emotions .
but then i take my niece off my shoulders , and she runs to elsa and anna — the thing she &apos;s been waiting so long for — and all that stuff goes away .
and the irs has introduced the program .
received very favorably by business .
last month , mit put out a study showing that by the end of this decade , in the sunny parts of the united states , solar electricity will be six cents a kilowatt hour compared to 15 cents as a national average .
and this game has been played by university professors and so forth .
and being naked and alone can be terrifying .
and informed consent is an idea that we should be very proud of as a society , right ? it &apos;s something that separates us from the nazis at nuremberg , enforced medical experimentation . it &apos;s the idea that agreement to join a study without understanding isn &apos;t agreement .
but the test of truth is , how do you weigh that priority against other priorities ?
it didn &apos;t change its economy . it didn &apos;t change the compositions of its population .
it would take me weeks just to figure out what i was looking at from raw ones and zeros , but because our brains can instantly pick up and recognize these subtle patterns inside of these visual abstractions , we can unconsciously apply those in new situations .
this is what english text looks like from a visual abstraction perspective .
so , soon after my arrival , i had confirmed something which i had already known ; that my instruments come from the heart of modern europe , yes .
traumatized people also easily lose control — symptoms are hyper-arousal and memory flashbacks — so people are in a constant fear that those horrible feelings of that traumatic event might come back unexpectedly , suddenly , and they cannot control it .
in 2007 , i was doing a research fellowship at the smithsonian natural history museum looking at bioluminous organisms in the oean .
and these two eyes are activating glowing water .
perhaps , that is why it took them almost six months to get her properly diagnosed .
one out of three people sitting in this audience will be diagnosed with some type of cancer , and one out of four will die because of it .
these are the cars .
this is juan carlos , king of spain .
i need you to go upstairs , past the fire , and i need you to get this woman a pair of shoes . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) i swear .
the act of kindness she noted above all others : someone had even gotten her a pair of shoes .
it was a horrible experience , and for us kids , it was terrorizing .
( applause )
the world is facing so many different conservation crises .
i am swimming against the tide .
and at this time , this star drops in its brightness over 20 percent .
and these are only the comets that happen to pass between us and the star .
my poker mates may have been bluffing about the hands that they drew , but they weren &apos;t bluffing about their social beliefs .
it was a real-time preview , and so it has become .
tc : so we wanted to look at this from a totally different angle .
even if one person led the whole dance but allowed this switch to happen , it would be a lot safer , while at the same time , offering new aesthetics into the waltz .
( laughter ) the second thing he said was that , &quot; &quot; if children have interest , then education happens . &quot; &quot; and i was doing that in the field , so every time i would watch it and think of him .
two children watch a tedtalk .
the system isn &apos;t chesapeake bay .
and this is the magic one .
and for the first time , i began to fear this group of people and to feel negative emotion towards a whole group of people .
and i learned about profit and revenue , about leverage , all sorts of things , from farmers , from seamstresses , from goat herders .
what has happened is that we &apos;ve largely lost control over our data and also our privacy .
so what we do is we generate encryption keys on your computer , and we don &apos;t generate a single key , but actually a pair of keys , so there &apos;s an rsa private key and an rsa public key , and these keys are mathematically connected .
and this corresponded to a tumor the size of a golf ball .
but for women with dense breasts ; we shouldn &apos;t abandon screening altogether , we need to offer them something better .
and in a nutshell , the answer is sadly yes .
but here &apos;s the thing : what movie do you suppose they think they &apos;re in ?
but it &apos;s because of the way that they relate that we get this sense of self .
and so forth .
leonard bernstein said two things are necessary for great achievement : a plan and not quite enough time .
you can go to the moon or you can have stability in your family life .
and they passed through you and me .
let me give you a sense of the timescale at work here .
that &apos;s the financial crisis .
it &apos;s groups like that in this room that generate the future of the u.s. economy .
these are the sentiments of someone that &apos;s been away from home .
state your name and age for the commission .
the sacred river , the urubamba , or the vilcanota , which is itself the earthly equivalent of the milky way , but it &apos;s also the trajectory that viracocha walked at the dawn of time when he brought the universe into being .
climb again over the course of 24 hours .
canada was just pipped to the post in terms of the number one fundraising campaign in the world .
not so with movember . movember started in a very traditional australian way . it was on a sunday afternoon .
mumbai-based dhruvi acharya builds on her love of comic books and street art to comment on the roles and expectations of modern indian women .
raqs are probably the foremost practitioners of multimedia art in india today , working across photography , video and installation .
so finally , we used a 3d surface scanner .
clearly , it always lived there .
you &apos;ll watch them both drop out of the middle class , but see what happens to women and see what happens to men .
what the economy requires now is a whole different set of skills .
so today , for me , being fearless means being honest .
and first , i commend you on your model knowledge . very impressive .
this working mother , all working mothers and all of their babies , are fine .
just put the term &quot; &quot; working mother &quot; &quot; into any google image search engine , stock photo site .
did your best work occur when you sidestepped your own ego and you stopped telling your story , but told someone else &apos;s story , someone perhaps without a voice , where empathetically , you stood in his shoes for a while or saw the world through his eyes ?
( applause ) the fact is , whether you &apos;re a rock star or whether you &apos;re a welder in a shipyard , or a tribesman in the upper amazon , or the queen of england , at the end of the day , we &apos;re all in the same boat .
stories have been used to dispossess and to malign , but stories can also be used to empower and to humanize .
so i felt enormous pity for fide &apos;s family .
and every now and then ms. carr would call me , and she &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; bryan , ms. parks is coming to town . we &apos;re going to get together and talk .
now i will warn you that this kind of identity is a much more challenging identity than ones that don &apos;t pay attention to this .
and on my first day of work i walked in and my boss tells me , &quot; do you know why you &apos;re here ? &quot;
i don &apos;t know how many of you know that five million children don &apos;t reach the age of five because of simple infections that can be prevented by an act of washing their hands with soap .
not a challenging task .
but it &apos;s made us think a little bit more deeply as well .
how did we become so indifferent to these crimes ?
many young humanitarian workers go through their first experience with a lot of bitterness .
what &apos;s basically happening is computers are going from being like spock to being a lot more like kirk .
all it needs are your goals and your constraints .
so what happens then ?
so this simple act of visualizing and doing over and over again produces some really remarkable outcomes .
in india , the definition of literacy , operating definition of literacy , is the ability , the grand ability , to write your own name in whatever language you happen to speak .
whereas in india , you cannot do that , because you have to listen to the public .
it &apos;s okay to be angry with the thing — the nuclear weapons in this case — but it is hopeless to be angry with the people .
and it &apos;s been translated into 26 languages .
what percentage of that was accounted for by foreign direct investment ?
not quite ten percent .
it &apos;s certainly not like china .
it &apos;s very difficult to start a private university .
finally , in the circle of the community , the orchestras prove to be the creative spaces of culture and sources of exchange and new meanings .
from that desire and from my heart stemmed the idea to make music a deep and global reality for my country .
the balance . thank you very much .
i figured i &apos;d have to do that ad , because i &apos;m an entrepreneur , because entrepreneur says that that &apos;s somebody who does what they want to do because they &apos;re not broke enough that they have to get a real job .
do you know that we have 1.4 million cellular radio masts deployed worldwide ?
what do we need to do ?
the best of here in the emerging economies — i call them the new east — they will jump the air line .
and she read so many novels , so many different novels here .
when our father did speak to us , it was from the pulpit of his mind .
and i realized that he was walking as if he was still under observation , but i admired his walk .
they also were able to install malware that wouldn &apos;t kick in and wouldn &apos;t trigger until the car was doing something like going over 20 miles an hour , or something like that .
how would you steal a car in this model ?
so i got involved in violent jihad in the mid &apos; 80s , starting with afghanistan .
i didn &apos;t break any laws .
she not only changed her own dynamic , she changed her household , she changed her family , her village .
they sold the milk for cash .
i &apos;m now going to start this experiment .
but not just simple simulations — we would also create advanced simulations with top universities like mit , to bring out cutting-edge cancer research to these students .
they probably also delivered complex organic material to earth , and that may have bootstrapped the emergence of life .
the findings of what we found on the comet : this thing would float in water .
but it &apos;s going to modernize weapons we do not need and will not be gotten rid of in our lifetime , unless we get up off our ...
i do not think about what i consider to be peace , which is sustainable peace with justice and equality .
the challenges were great .
we &apos;ve got many trials going on in the community and in schools , and through the lessons that we &apos;ve learned in the field , we &apos;ve realized it &apos;s extremely important to share the data in non-medical jargon so that people understand what we &apos;re examining and what that means to them .
if you have followed diplomatic news in the past weeks , you may have heard of a kind of crisis between china and the u.s.
why ? because no nation knows for sure whether its neighbor is about to attack .
they vary between cultures , between nations , between individuals , between social classes , between education levels .
15 seconds studio .
and you can notice they have created a kind of false catchment .
( laughter ) we had full-page advertisements , some 30 years , 25 years ago when this canal came .
it acts as a backup to the internet so that , when the power goes out , it fails over and connects to the nearest gsm network .
guess how much it costs to call rwanda , ghana , nigeria ?
their symmetry , their attractive materials and , above all , their meticulous workmanship are simply quite beautiful to our eyes , even today .
how can we explain this universality ?
because when you think about the importance , some of the issues that we were talking about last night — this last session we had about africa and his hypothetical 50 billion dollars destined for africa .
and there are different ways .
we &apos;ve never had this before because kyoto didn &apos;t work .
by tackling the impossible , you make the impossible possible .
and this is one of those images .
so they copy each other .
and they said , &quot; &quot; hey , do you want to jam ? &quot; &quot; and i was like , &quot; &quot; sure . &quot; &quot; so i picked up my banjo and i nervously played four songs that i actually knew with them .
and i know u.s.-china relations doesn &apos;t need another lawyer .
i &apos;m hiv positive . i &apos;ve dealt with it all . &quot; &quot; and she said , &quot; &quot; what would i miss ?
and i reflected , as i was watching her sell the dresses , and also the jewelry that she makes , that now jane makes more than four dollars a day .
they were very friendly .
they &apos;ll never be able to cope . &quot; &quot; not only do our children cope very well , but they excel in it .
she rides her bicycle .
the okinawans have this ancestor veneration .
so what we did was a survey in the public investment system , and found out that there were three ministries with three projects in the exact same place , not knowing of the existence of the other projects .
it &apos;s a fact that people are moving towards cities .
this shift has created what professor nicolaus mills calls a culture of humiliation .
that was it .
my high school is chicago , diverse and segregated on purpose .
i march down hallways cleaned up after me every day by regular janitors , but i never have the decency to honor their names .
( applause ) i think it &apos;s safe to say that all of us here are deeply concerned about the escalating violence in our daily lives .
vishnu gave his judgment .
here is gdp per capita from 1900 to 1929 .
and over the next 18 years have almost tripled .
this is the strange inversion .
do you know of any car that didn ’ t have a maker ? yes / no .
generally , if i think something is wrong , i query it three times .
a great editor saves a writer from her excesses .
i have a couple of questions .
ca : it &apos;s amazing .
we have added little plastic particles to the sand on ocean beaches .
and there &apos;s an interesting little paradox , too .
let me give you an example .
and i &apos;ve come to understand that &quot; &quot; normal &quot; &quot; has a lot to do with expectations .
i took the copenhagen subway map and i renamed all the stations to abstract musical provocations , and the players , who are synchronized with stopwatches , follow the timetables , which are listed in minutes past the hour .
and so i decided to put that idea , boredom , as the focus of my presentation to you today .
and you can see here that the flash of light has exactly the same effect .
so the next time the fly finds itself facing the same odor again , the connection is strong enough to turn on the motors and to trigger an evasive maneuver .
the answer to such a question is as varied as the people that take to the road , but travelers often respond with a single word : freedom .
years have passed , but many of the adventures i fantasized about as a child — traveling and weaving my way between worlds other than my own — have become realities through my work as a documentary photographer .
but the actual robot is really only half the story .
so a few years ago , my friend eric and i decided we wanted to explore this underwater cave in the foothills of the sierras .
and when i first arrived in damascus , i saw this strange moment where people didn &apos;t seem to believe that war was going to descend , and it was exactly the same in bosnia and nearly every other country i &apos;ve seen where war comes .
they stay because you want to stay in your home .
and from that graveyard , i began the search once more , not because i was brave , but because i knew that i would either believe or i would die .
there we were , souls and bodies packed into a texas church on the last night of our lives .
but here , on this image of the world , remember we &apos;ve stretched the map again .
i can give you good news story after good news story about what is getting better in the planet , but we tend to concentrate on the bad news that is immediate .
we need to accommodate the very large and the very small simultaneously .
but there &apos;s one thing that doesn &apos;t get much attention .
and the sum looks like this .
it is new media created from old media .
and yet recommendation system after recommendation system continues to miss the boat .
people aren &apos;t close or distant .
and so , as we get to stage 12 and we partake of that , again completing the life cycle , you know , we have a chance to essentially ingest that — it nurtures us , and we continue to carry on and have opportunities to ponder things like this .
in other words , the beer-maker knows also how to evoke flavor from the grains by using sprouting and malting and roasting .
but it wouldn &apos;t have to be approved by regulators ; you &apos;d have to convince an actuary that it would be safe .
( laughter ) if you shine a light on them , they produce electricity .
what we found was an overwhelming sense of helplessness .
it took 158 days to get a new electric connection .
let me show you what i mean .
people in prostitution , including people who have been trafficked into it , regularly receive multiple convictions for prostitution .
but these individuals , they risk their lives every day to protect the individuals in their communities , and by doing so , protect us all .
it says everything that makes up us , and it tells us so much information .
if there &apos;s one thing i can encourage everyone to do , politicians , religious leaders , and us , it would be what i call &quot; &quot; expanding the moral imagination &quot; &quot; — that is to say , your ability to put yourself in the shoes of people in very different circumstances .
you &apos;ve probably heard the term &quot; &quot; interdependence &quot; &quot; applied to the modern world . well , that &apos;s just another term for non-zero-sum .
look , we put online almost every week new , updated series on the world top income database and we will keep doing so in the future , in particular in emerging countries , and i welcome all of those who want to contribute to this data collection process .
so of course some families will consume more than that , some will consume less , so there will be some mobility in the distribution , but on average , they only need to reinvest one fifth , so this allows high wealth inequalities to be sustained .
this is perhaps my favorite .
what i thought was most fascinating was they &apos;ve actually paid for the coffee break at one of the law enforcement conferences earlier this year .
you can have a virus where people feel well enough while they &apos;re infectious that they get on a plane or they go to a market .
there &apos;s a group of handsome epidemiologists ready to go , they move in , they save the day , but that &apos;s just pure hollywood .
but actually it doesn &apos;t work that way .
if we were to talk about indigenous women , if we were to talk about trans women , it would even go further down .
well by measuring oxytocin we found that the more money the second person received , the more their brain produced oxytocin , and the more oxytocin on board , the more money they returned .
there are 800 different languages in the highlands .
that &apos;s on a piece of 8 by 12 paper .
do they have t.b. ? do they have aids ?
i mean , really open your mind with this .
so this is important .
this is literally the colored sequence of those tiles .
this is three minutes of uv light .
and you can see these large , yolked-up eggs bursting through the surface of this male &apos;s testes .
what would our unborn children say to us when they have an exposure that &apos;s happening everyday , day after day ?
how do you study a mountain for the kinds of things we &apos;re talking about ?
now , he &apos;s a rock climber , but you know , he &apos;s our executive director .
here you are , pulling off the band-aid .
and here is rise .
that &apos;s my daughter and me .
that &apos;s my house .
now religions have a much saner attitude to art .
ab : you can get shot by both sides .
to show you now what we are working on by starting out talking about the american soldier , that on average does carry about 100 lbs. on their backs , and they are being asked to carry more equipment .
eb : amanda is wearing our elegs set .
it was almost as if the hole in his heart was so large that even the love of a family , without work , could not fill it .
i love the brooklyn dodgers , as you do , but i promise you some day they will win fairly and squarely .
so this is the first audio tool i want to talk about .
( toy squeaks ) ( typewriter ) ( drums ) ( ping-pong ) ( knives being sharpened ) ( record scratches ) ( saw cuts ) ( woman screams ) what i &apos;m sort of trying to demonstrate with these tools is that sound is a language .
what is the cost of not trying ?
i &apos;ve heard it said that the most dangerous animal on the planet is the adolescent male .
we are not passive consumers of data and technology .
so many years ago , you may remember that former president ronald reagan was very criticized for making a statement that facts are stupid things .
we &apos;re told that our jails are places for criminals , but statistically that &apos;s not the case : three out of every five people in jail right now are there pretrial .
i &apos;m guessing most of you have paid your tickets as well .
well , what would a tudor gentleman be preoccupied with ?
you put all those together , and you &apos;ve got your story to fill in that gap that makes you keep coming back .
i like to read books on it .
it looks terrible . is it a little hot plate ?
bakers smell good when they come home from work .
so how does this work ?
or you can go all the way back to 63 a.d. — ( laughter ) — and there &apos;s this poor man who doesn &apos;t like the way people are speaking latin .
slash is used in a very different way in texting among young people today .
collect his data .
and when you think in that way , you become more sensitive to the human considerations , which are crucial to making ethical decisions .
everything started breaking .
so we &apos;ve built this system where we understand all the parts of it , but we &apos;re using it in a very , very different way than we expected to use it , and it &apos;s gotten a very , very different scale than it was designed for .
just a thought .
( applause )
and that &apos;s felony murder — 25 to life , parole at 50 if you &apos;re lucky , and tony &apos;s not feeling very lucky .
&quot; &quot; what are you going to teach me about right and wrong ?
you work by learning , and you learn by working .
and my hope is that some of you out there may be able to help us .
i have one more reason for optimism : climate change .
and i was horrified , too .
miko : did you hear about nakilia &apos;s big halloween party this weekend ?
the other kind of reviewer is a certain flavor of feminist who thinks they know what little girls ought to be .
but i promise you , you name it , we had to try it to get there .
yes . in the end .
these two molecules code and decode .
so hopefully tomorrow i ’ ll show one or two more objects from the stage , but for today i just wanted to say thank you for all the people that came and talked to us about it .
and boris johnson thought of creating olympicopolis .
this is the headquarters for china &apos;s national broadcaster , which i designed together with rem koolhaas at oma .
so these reactors run for 30 years without refueling , which is , in my opinion , very , very amazing , because it means it &apos;s a sealed system .
carbon-free electricity .
we &apos;ve done this for a very difficult case , which was for deforestation in china .
the reason this is happening boils down , in my mind , to one basic problem , which is our inability to perceive the difference between public benefits and private profits .
we are on the verge of the greatest exploration that the human race has ever known .
it &apos;s all government research dollars , and very few of those .
would everybody put their hand under their bottom and feel their tailbone ?
or you can pull them up where you want them .
the final movement is called mounds .
this is a photographic representation , called snapshots .
and lastly , believe her .
and that website provides a critical forum , because there is no global , legal thing to help us figure this out .
for example , scouts are curious .
they &apos;re more likely to feel intrigued when they encounter something that contradicts their expectations .
it will work the same either way .
it also led them to read shorter books .
so what happens when operating costs are low ?
to my knowledge , this is the first time that we &apos;ve been able to track the ongoing evolution of collective behavior in a natural population of animals and find out what &apos;s actually working best .
are we designing for the world that we have ?
it &apos;s the knockout .
to understand this , i went back to turkey about a year after the gezi protests and i interviewed a range of people , from activists to politicians , from both the ruling party and the opposition party and movements .
inequality is stifling human growth and potential and economies .
remarkably — no , miraculously — he lived .
i know john &apos;s story very well because i &apos;m john .
we all know that in our on-demand lives , one of the things that &apos;s most on demand is ourselves .
and so , to my great surprise , i found that going nowhere was at least as exciting as going to tibet or to cuba .
and all of this paid off in spectacular fashion , creating the kind of country that was unimaginable 20 years ago .
now , this peña hardly inspired much confidence at first .
and i really didn &apos;t know what i would do , but friends of mine began telling me about children shooting other children with guns .
it was a matter of , i wanted actually a break , and we looked at maps , we looked at graphs , we asked some questions and tried some tools that actually have been used many times before for other things .
they found her abandoned boat two months later adrift near france .
i walked to a party where people i know try hard to know me and ask where i &apos;ve been , but i can &apos;t explain what i &apos;ve seen to them .
just a regular piece of paper with a little bit of ink on it .
do you know what it takes to do this ?
what they lack is that safe space to come together , agree and move to action .
transparency is absolutely critical to this .
that &apos;s actually hy .
so , what i did when i was painting was i started singing , because i really adore singing , and i think that music is the highest form of all art .
the electrons go to work in the real world out here , powering our devices .
i made the battery all liquid — liquid metals for both electrodes and a molten salt for the electrolyte .
so once a year , you can go home to your family , spend 30 days and then come on back . &quot; &quot; needless to say , that didn &apos;t resonate for me .
so , what i did — and he said , &quot; &quot; you shouldn &apos;t worry , jim , because there are a lot of trailer parks . &quot; &quot; so i put out another exhaustive list of going to trailer parks .
here are some recent images .
we believe there &apos;s some water in the polar caps , there are polar caps of north pole and south pole .
what is the imagery of god ?
for what defines humanity , perhaps biologically , is our physiology , but god defines humanity by our spirituality , by our nature .
over the next five years we hope to save the lives of almost a million babies .
he looks like he &apos;s resting peacefully , but in fact he &apos;s struggling to stay alive because he can &apos;t regulate his own body temperature .
but what we &apos;re finding around the world , over and over again , is , if you build a toilet and you leave it there , it doesn &apos;t get used .
they learn something , they put it back into the product , they put it back into the market .
and this is the one that i work on , atlas .
and , again , a eu standard-size , real person , so you get some sense of the scale .
we put it in eddie &apos;s sleeve , and so the hand that you see — i &apos;ll show you again , that &apos;s not eddie &apos;s hand , that &apos;s tom &apos;s .
and there was this giant question mark . i love the design , for what it &apos;s worth , of this thing . and i started thinking , why haven &apos;t i opened it ?
forgot this .
and i &apos;m going to use it to give you my take on the stuff of life .
he had installed the heavy equipment for his new process in an abandoned store in the vicinity of kings mountain , and for two months these 16 men would live and work together , mastering the new process .
if they didn &apos;t like each other , we could all get trampled to death .
so , as you can imagine , this was a paradigm shift in the survey and construction as well as in reality capture industry .
we also produce media for dissemination to the public — free through the cyark website .
thanks to modern technology , the government knows far too much about what happens behind closed doors .
if you haven &apos;t seen one , it &apos;s probably because you didn &apos;t know what to look for — they &apos;re everywhere .
instead , i ended up stoning my neighbors &apos; cars . ( laughter ) they were not enthusiastic about my patriotism .
what really matters is how i deal with it .
it &apos;s going to be built by users , by people who get this data together , by people who want to aggregate all sorts of maps from wherever they come from , all sorts of medieval romances from wherever they come from , people who just want to curate their own glorious selection of beautiful things .
and now we think we know .
now does that mean there &apos;s going to be life all around ?
but on the other hand , given all this organic dust that &apos;s floating around , we could have lots of friends out there .
the best way to learn about anything is through stories , and so i want to tell you a story about work and play and about four aspects of life that we need to embrace in order for our own creativity to flourish .
there &apos;s a fourth embrace , and it &apos;s the hardest .
so now that you &apos;ve built your own conservation drone , you probably want to go fly it , but how does one fly a drone ?
this is an oil palm plantation in sumatra .
and in showing you this , you know , when we &apos;re looking at this data , we &apos;re thinking , oh do these animals , do they cross the equator ?
and sure , it may be just one big old silly fish , but it &apos;s helping .
( laughter ) the movie folks also tell us that our economy loses over 370,000 jobs to content theft , which is quite a lot when you consider that , back in &apos; 98 , the bureau of labor statistics indicated that the motion picture and video industries were employing 270,000 people .
because what little hoodlum wouldn &apos;t want a million and a half bucks-worth of stolen goods in his pocket .
we make every aspect of this burger .
i &apos;ve been interested in food for a long time .
and soon they were all dancing this joyous , exuberant dance right there on their lawn . ( laughter ) and as i walked through the neighborhood , i was amazed and i was moved by the incredible sense of ownership this community clearly felt about this event .
i have to say , it wasn &apos;t exactly what i had in mind for my first day down under .
i believe that every single person listening to me tonight can be part of that change .
it is important to assess the potential risks and benefits of the standard of care which is to be provided to participants in any clinical trial , and establish one which is relevant for the context of the study and most beneficial for the participants within the study .
that &apos;s our number . 10 billion .
but by then cattle were already raised unnaturally .
and along the way , he became the face for the us government &apos;s recent pattern of prosecuting whistleblowers and spying on journalists .
so from 2007 to 2015 , risen lived under the specter of going to federal prison .
so it &apos;s really just supply .
but once a pair leaves the retail channel , it &apos;s the wild west .
we have to change it so that people have equal opportunity .
and so this leads to the paradox that because the disease is only in the poorer countries , it doesn &apos;t get much investment .
i think it will be great .
and at the end of the four days , your brain is humming and you feel energized , alive and excited , and it &apos;s because all these different bits have been put together .
people swore they were eating barbecue sauce , and this is free food .
we could eliminate sugar across the board for all confectionary products and sodas , and we can replace it with all-natural fresh fruit .
one of my students came up after class , an introductory class , and she said , &quot; &quot; you know , poetry is harder than writing , &quot; &quot; which i found both erroneous and profound .
attempts to put my poems to music have had disastrous results , in all cases .
the icebergs around me were almost 200 feet out of the water , and i could only help but wonder that this was one snowflake on top of another snowflake , year after year .
through my work i &apos;m trying to articulate that humans are not separate from nature and that everything is interconnected .
lg : right . so i have for a long time said that what we really needed was a rapid diagnostic .
katrina showed us that we cannot completely depend on government to have readiness in hand , to be capable of handling things .
( laughter ) so i wanted to help you a little bit .
but the thing that i &apos;m really , really excited about is this incredible granola house .
what &apos;s happening now with pawa ?
that day in the stadium , i stood up as a smart coward .
( applause ) for this to work , this progress must be sustainable .
20 percent are getting treated .
ca : 60,000 .
so you can ask : how happy is the experiencing self ?
einstein , can you also sing ?
e : what &apos;s the matter ?
you don &apos;t have to . it &apos;s fine . check it out .
( beatboxing ) there &apos;s always got to be a bit of a dance at the start , because it &apos;s just fun , so you can clap along if you want .
so here we say , again , what we said before : that each skin of the onion shows a similarity to the adjoining skins .
so here are the themes . we believe there is a unified theory underlying all the regularities .
in brazil , almost 70 percent of the evaporation that makes rain actually comes from the forest .
so in the last 10 years , deforestation came down in brazil 75 percent .
sabo translates to &quot; &quot; strangers &apos; quarters . &quot; &quot; and the community is predominantly made up of people from the northern part of the country .
the third step was a challenge .
&quot; this is a new beginning , a new life . &quot;
and he leapt .
in 1999 , two and a half years into that job , something happened .
and i sat there for quite some time going , &quot; &quot; how am i going to get off this rock and go home ?
this image in particular really captured our attention at the time , because it so much sums up that event .
db : yes . of course . i love you .
it meant , for the first time , i could read back what i had typed into it .
i could have family and friends read me material , and i could then read it back as many times as i needed .
i want you to know that we can all make a difference by making different choices , by buying our food directly from local farmers , or our neighbors who we know in real life .
so i ask myself , how can i change ? how can i change these things ?
because our egocentric perception — from the buddha &apos;s point of view , misperception — is that all we are is what is inside our skin .
you know , someone sitting next to you in a seat — that &apos;s ok because you &apos;re in a theater , but if you were sitting on a park bench and someone came up and sat that close to you , you &apos;d freak out .
all the casework is hand-scribed in , uniquely , so you can &apos;t just cut 100 parts for 100 trailers , you have to cut them big , and every single one is hand-fit .
i thought , &quot; &quot; finally , oh yeah great , big company , i &apos;m gonna work with somebody with money for tooling and molding . &quot; &quot; and i walked in their prototype facility , and it &apos;s exactly like my shop , only bigger — same tools , same things .
it sometimes makes mistakes and corrects them .
maybe they should be able to anticipate what you &apos;re about to do .
well , computers are actually beginning to master human language with techniques that are similar to the neocortex .
but the frontal cortex is not really qualitatively different .
okay , so here &apos;s where we started .
i &apos;m going to tell you why .
the world does not see all people like me as champions .
special olympics is transforming their lives off the field .
we then go on to the first thing that was very surprising .
now , if i hadn &apos;t paid attention to embodied energy , it would have taken us over 50 years to break even compared to the upgraded house .
lt : oh ... jf : no ?
and i feel so bad for men because they don &apos;t have that .
even when we try to get rid of a technology , it &apos;s actually very hard .
and one definition of technology is that which is first recorded .
gets up to 600 , 700 degrees f , somewhere in that range .
here &apos;s the x-wing death jelly .
we only can create a vision of the future , how it might be , a vision which reveals disruptive ideas , which is inspiring , and this is the most important reason which breaks the chains of common thinking .
how this looks in particular , you can show it here .
there &apos;s this to prove that things can always change — the 10 of hearts .
the old man turned to me and he said , &quot; you could pick a red card or a black card . &quot;
whatever you &apos;re doing with your hands , it &apos;s understanding that gesture .
this is incredible , really .
marianne , in the center of the screen in the red sweater , she summed up that entire two-hour conversation in a phrase that i will never forget .
mg : i would say this — join the conversation .
the poor pc guy . they &apos;re duct taping his head . they &apos;re just wrapping it on him .
they &apos;d collected information with photos . they &apos;d manually build each building .
this is a season of grace .
why ? because they were old and infirm , and we needed to go by to see if they needed anything .
and we were really surprised to see that the pattern you have now in your brains when i &apos;m describing to you these scenes would be very similar to the pattern i had when i watched this movie a few months ago in the scanner .
so keep being coupled to other people .
that &apos;s to prevent pirates from attacking it .
&quot; mom , i see the world . &quot;
and that engine is going to see the results in 20 years .
some of the results that go across every single country include teachers saying they have never loved teaching so much , and reading comprehension measured by third parties — not by us — skyrockets .
this was a different record .
i told her that i wanted to up the ante and hold my breath longer than any human being ever had .
a full third of those who braved tanks and tear gas to ask or to demand liberty and justice in egypt were women .
one said to me , &quot; &quot; our people used to gather in cafes to watch football &quot; &quot; — or soccer , as we say in america — &quot; and now they gather to watch parliament . &quot;
little by little , we &apos;re giving sight to the machines .
if you consider a child &apos;s eyes as a pair of biological cameras , they take one picture about every 200 milliseconds , the average time an eye movement is made .
but the real test is going to be asia .
but we can definitely see why it hasn &apos;t happened yet .
we go from this view out to the stars .
it actually flies underneath saturn .
( music ) the bus was done with a cargo-scanning x-ray machine , which is used on the borders between countries , looking for contraband and illegal immigrants .
it &apos;s not just topshop , i get some strange looks when i go out getting my props .
third , when we expanded our facility , we tried a new type of design .
we can do that .
there &apos;s another risk , and they respond less to this existing risk .
but that &apos;s enormously important for policy .
it &apos;s fantastic for them and their families , but we &apos;ve got two billion people in the global middle class today , and this swells that number to five , a big challenge when we already have resource scarcity .
every time the sun comes out after that , the electricity is free .
the classic example is pollution .
the question then is , how do we tap into this ?
heart disease used to be the biggest killer , particularly for men in their 40s .
&quot; &quot; we always overestimate the change that will occur in the next two years and underestimate the change that will occur in the next 10 . &quot; &quot; — bill gates .
i truly hope you will join us .
and then we have to ask : who should be responsible for them ?
and now what we &apos;re looking at is really creating a surface capture as opposed to a marker capture .
so there really was no tolerable margin of error .
novelty is a concept of commerce , not an aesthetic concept .
so this gave me the possibility because now i was a journeyman , and journeymen also take their satchel and go to see the world .
i myself am personalizing these cultural developments , but i also understand that this has to be done organically .
you know , art and culture is big business .
but now , we have a real technology to do this .
we &apos;ve collapsed that through technology to milliseconds , and that allows us to let peter to look at his brain in real time as he &apos;s inside the scanner .
we think that might have something to do with reagan .
and so you too can type in any word or phrase that you &apos;re interested in and see its n-gram immediately — also browse examples of all the various books in which your n-gram appears .
here we were at every annual step through our first hundred years .
a list , though , would last .
it looks like you just emptied the oil pan in your car , and you just dumped it in the ocean .
they can handle a hurricane that comes and goes .
( applause )
and i don &apos;t know , i think this project has a lot of possibilities , and i encourage you all to record just a small snippet of your life every day , so you can never forget that that day , you lived .
booted up in a cell , the program would execute , and it could result in this person ; or with a small change , it could result in this person ; or another small change , this person ; or with a larger change , this dog , or this tree , or this whale .
and if you buy all of this , and you think life is about computation , as i do , then you look at big questions through the eyes of a computer scientist .
so clear . maybe a little bit over-clear .
( laughter ) did you see lenny &apos;s face ?
so now suppose we test them all .
who likes that answer ?
yet i still hadn &apos;t saved a single life .
you could regain this time .
and like all of these successful and responsible ceos say , you can &apos;t have just one of these things be successful if you want a meaningful and successful job .
so existence is temporarily suspended .
turn and face your neighbors .
it &apos;s this brain which makes this reflex .
we won &apos;t talk about that anymore . it &apos;s too depressing .
and he asked a very important question .
can you see it ?
but what we can do in the meantime is measure the light from our stars and learn about this relationship between the planets and their parent stars to suss out clues about which planets might be good places to look for life in the universe .
what &apos;s wrong with you people on the other side in the other party ?
you can see the moral electromagnet operating in the u.s. congress .
since then , i &apos;ve made a career of painting people in water .
and i was afraid , because i didn &apos;t want to paint anymore .
at the end of it all , the court unanimously agreed that her in-laws should be arrested for what they did to her , her fucking brother should also be arrested for selling her — ( applause ) — and they agreed that she did have a right to civil compensation .
two hundred and eighty million .
it was not the first time that mathematics was revolutionizing our view of the world .
and beautiful mathematical explanations are not only for our pleasure .
you ever thought about that ?
thank you so much .
you want a cigarette in prison ? three to five dollars .
and there &apos;s very illegal hustles , which you smuggle in , you get smuggled in , drugs , pornography , cell phones , and just as in the outer world , there &apos;s a risk-reward tradeoff , so the riskier the enterprise , the more profitable it can potentially be .
it was the first de-extinction in history .
ben novak was the youngest scientist at the meeting .
but i got a little bad news for you folks . i got some bad news .
i don &apos;t know if you can get that here . ( laughter ) so , zizzing away , and so — ( laughter ) — and for every one — i know , i drew this myself . thank you .
i grew up on a small farm in missouri .
are we going to work with 6.9 billion consumers ?
it &apos;s good to start with some examples .
or i &apos;m going to use simple to mean reliable , predictable , repeatable .
when marriage was an economic enterprise , infidelity threatened our economic security .
am i going on for another 25 years like this ?
africa &apos;s begging-bowl leaks .
( applause ) now , this leadership is a far cry from the traditional leaders that africans have known for centuries .
we scraped like 1,000 studies from pubmed , the biomedical database , and we compiled them and graded them all .
so information is beautiful . data is beautiful .
( music ) ( laughter ) which is , are you talking about the thing with the singing cats ? like , is that the thing you think is going to be good for society ?
but there was one programmer who decided that this wasn &apos;t the way to work .
art and politics occupy an ambiguous site outside the museum walls , but inside of the museum &apos;s core , blending its air with the democratic air of the mall .
it really goes beyond distinction .
because there &apos;s a sport , there &apos;s an activity going on that we &apos;re all aware of , that we condone .
i had tears rolling down my cheeks .
the height of the bars is the risk of death , and those zero , one , two , three , four numbers on the horizontal axis are the number of those healthy habits that a given person had .
several long-term studies have shown that girls who diet in their early teenage years are three times more likely to become overweight five years later , even if they started at a normal weight , and all of these studies found that the same factors that predicted weight gain also predicted the development of eating disorders .
but it isn &apos;t really enough just to look at the cells from a few people or a small group of people , because we have to step back .
at some point in our lives , all of us , or people we care about , become patients , and that &apos;s why i think that stem cell research is incredibly important for all of us .
and i find myself now in the unlikely position of standing in front of all of you as a professional classical composer and conductor .
and about a week later , a friend of mine came to me and said , &quot; &quot; listen , you &apos;ve got to join choir .
and yesterday , i went to one of the local supermarkets that i often visit to inspect , if you like , what they &apos;re throwing away .
having gone through the data , i then needed to demonstrate where that food ends up .
let &apos;s just do a little mathematical experiment , try and find out .
in fact , in a very precise way , they get us to a different level because they seem to be things that are capable of complexity that &apos;s sort of as great as complexity can ever get ...
i believe that animation can change biology .
the payoffs can be huge , though .
and here &apos;s a shot of me , this is the before shot of me .
this was our laboratory before .
it &apos;s an incredibly non-materialistic culture , where people don &apos;t have a lot , but they &apos;re incredibly happy .
a 53-year-old farmer . she was chaffing wheat , and that pile of wheat behind her had taken her about a week to make .
what in the laboratory that i see out there , the laboratories of democracy , what has happened ?
and in the pile were things like zero taxes for 20 years , or that we &apos;d help to build a new factory for the company , we &apos;d help to finance it . the uaw , who represented the workers , said they would offer unprecedented concessions , sacrifices to just keep those jobs in greenville .
and the only difference really between me and those people in hoodies down the road with their fat-funded companies , is that i &apos;m not inspired by helping you find chinese food at 2am in dallas , or helping you touch your wrist and get a car immediately , or swipe right and get laid .
so we &apos;ll run over 200 campaigns this year , things like collecting peanut butter for food pantries , or making valentine &apos;s day cards for senior citizens who are homebound .
it &apos;s a complex system , but within it , there is no waste .
and my curiosity took me to some extraordinary places .
are they actually willing to work abroad ?
and if you compare this red area in 2030 with the red area in 2014 , it is much , much smaller .
( applause )
so , here you can see her moving her eyes around , moving her mouth around .
so the original study found that participants who were played mozart music for a few minutes did better on a subsequent i.q. test than participants who simply sat in silence .
in fact , the average man can throw a ball further than about 98 percent of all women .
after the water &apos;s been through this two-stage process , it &apos;s safe to drink .
let &apos;s create a water system that &apos;s consistent with out environmental values .
they want positive actions they can engage in , and in their bones , they know it &apos;s time to take personal responsibility and invest in more kindness to each other and to the environment .
we &apos;re starting to build resilience ourselves .
nowhere else in the world has community-adopted conservation at this scale .
it killed almost everything that was left .
the internet has been doubling in power and continues to , measured many different ways .
but if you ask me , what will it cost for one mips of computing in 2010 , or the cost to sequence a base pair of dna in 2012 , or the cost of sending a megabyte of data wirelessly in 2014 , it turns out that those are very predictable .
you could love crossfit , and really like cross-stitch .
thank you so much .
of those , seven have nuclear weapons .
just put up ... hands up , people who changed their minds during the debate , who voted differently .
little girls are amazing .
and , for instance , computers are really good at repeating stuff , so the way ruby would teach loops goes like this .
and probably the best example we have here in america is portland , oregon .
was it designed around cars or around people ?
and it &apos;s the infrastructure that really determines whether this process goes forward .
finally , in the early part of — or actually the middle of 2002 , we flew the 400 — m400 , which was the four-passenger vehicle .
if you haven &apos;t ordered yet , i generally find the rigatoni with the spicy tomato sauce goes best with diseases of the small intestine .
and part of — what &apos;s so interesting about this story to me is that in some ways , it &apos;s a great case study in how cultural change happens , how a good idea eventually comes to win out over much worse ideas .
well after two years , i &apos;ve come to the conclusion that , especially local government , is about opossums .
boston doesn &apos;t just have a call center .
and doug was really disappointed to learn that nearly 80 percent of the pediatric patients in this hospital had to be sedated in order to deal with his mri machine .
about that time he was at the d.school at stanford taking classes .
this is what makes me really unpopular with my research team .
this is a spectacular coral garden .
this is a smartphone app that we are working on .
ev : he is not talking to you , but on his phone .
think of the implications .
the largest organism on the planet is a mycelial mat , one cell wall thick .
and this is my postcard collection today .
i feel like the happiest person on earth ( now . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of these men is the father of my son .
they &apos;re pre-engineered to be light , sound , motors and sensors .
we &apos;ve been giving littlebits to kids and seeing them play with them .
now , this is the important thing of understanding how the world has changed .
this is the income distribution of peoples in the world , from $ 1 . this is where you have food to eat .
two years after this , i was the first to base jump from matterhorn , a very famous mountain that probably everybody knows in here .
and all this to come as close as possible to the human dream of being able to fly .
but why are there so many orphans in europe when there hasn &apos;t been a great deal of war or disaster in recent years ?
if we know people who are planning to support orphanages , we should convince them to support family services instead .
my father can &apos;t go back , either .
i &apos;d fallen into the limiting trap that the language of coming from countries sets — the privileging of a fiction , the singular country , over reality : human experience .
what you see here on the screen right now is a very simple visualization of that body .
he &apos;s actually a better dancer than i am , i have to say .
i &apos;m going to go very , very quickly through this .
and it was defended , believe it or not , by the librarians .
our goal is to ensure that they leave with a better sense of how to make things than when they arrived , and the deep internal realization that you can figure things out by fooling around .
problems become puzzles and obstacles disappear .
embalming is a cheat code , providing the illusion that death and then decay are not the natural end for all organic life on this planet .
in those four-to-six weeks , your molecules become other molecules ; you literally transform .
friends , you will hear a lot about it .
he sent us to one of the best schools in the city and gave us the best education .
that doesn &apos;t make sense .
we do things to this ; we need to do things for this .
&quot; &quot; they &apos;re not sure this rises to the level of harassment , and they &apos;re not set up technically to find the device . &quot; &quot; &quot; okay , what about the fbi ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; i already have , &quot; &quot; she told me .
this is how they get the gold and the other valuable materials out .
so i look at the refrigerator as a sign of modernity , but we actually haven &apos;t really changed the design of them that much since the 1950s .
i showed some people a picture of tom , and a picture of jerry .
are we superman , or are we homer simpson ?
off we headed to the airport .
iw : one day we had a lesson in class where we learned about significant people , like nelson mandela , lady diana and mahatma gandhi .
the ugliest part of our body is our brain .
now , was it because there weren &apos;t any orange balloons ?
( applause )
so now what i can do is , rather than getting the instructions for the device online , i can simply point at it , the device is recognized , and then — voice : begin by plugging in the grey adsl cable .
you punch it up , and then when i would do that , it was throwing my shoulder this way ...
it &apos;s so much fun to do .
you know , you think about , brands are starting to fill the gaps .
and this is a global survey , so these numbers are global .
here in uganda , development aid .
they move up into that corner .
it cannot be bought or arranged or made with bombs .
it is deeper , it is a process , it is acute awareness that we are all utterly inter-bended , and one action by one being in one tiny town has consequences everywhere .
you know what i mean ?
i think , really , i can &apos;t talk about race without remembering that it is a construct in certain respects , but also that , you know , until we redress the wrongs of the past , we &apos;re going to be turned around .
to which i get the classic four-year-old response : &quot; why not ? &quot;
we might be able to feed the front row .
you put it out there into the media and start thinking about it .
running horizontally along the graph , is &quot; &quot; ecological footprint , &quot; &quot; which is a measure of how much resources we use and how much pressure we put on the planet .
( applause )
this is a bronze ball , an aluminum arm here , and then this wooden disk .
imagine you are being asked to pay a bribe in your day-to-day life to get something done .
most definitely you don &apos;t want to pay the bribe .
they also understand that foreplay is not something you do five minutes before the real thing .
give me novelty , give me familiarity .
this mother , diane downs , shot her kids at close range , drove them to the hospital while they bled all over the car , claimed a scraggy-haired stranger did it .
you can consciously contract the muscles in your cheeks .
being queer and trans is about creating new ways of existing .
our experience does not invalidate other peoples &apos; experience , but it should and necessarily does complicate this idea of what love and marriage are supposed to be .
because they have injected huge productivity improvement .
consumers spent 3 billion dollars on electronics that day .
woman : they insisted that i was lying .
man : the soldiers with clubs this long beat us to get a confession .
and to try this — i couldn &apos;t get a loaner , but i did go into the manhattan showroom of the manufacturer , toto , and they have a bathroom off of the showroom that you can use , which i used .
and cheval blanc is kind of an unusual wine for bordeaux in having a significant percentage of the cabernet franc grape .
but experts do get things wrong .
we need to fundamentally redefine who it is that experts are .
so we said , &quot; &quot; what can we do to empower this teacher to do more ? &quot; &quot; how to access the digital world ?
frugal digital is essentially a small research group at c.i.d.
the whole system kind of working on it , and everybody contributing a small little part .
it follows a power law , so that there are a few extremely well-linked to , popular blogs , and a long tail of blogs with very few links .
people go , one , two , three , four .
audience : fold . js : really loud .
he who seeks gratification shall be disappointed .
and at night , just one line of light cuts through the mountain , which is a skylight on top of that triangle .
it &apos;s an international project .
so , keep your eyes on those bright images again .
so she elected to undergo a focused ultrasound procedure in 2008 .
&quot; &quot; on june 20th , &quot; &quot; if you can read it , &quot; 2011 . &quot;
early explorers sailed off the edge of the map , and they found a place where the normal rules of time and temperature seem suspended .
more importantly , they prepare it for inspection and analysis by 27 independent laboratories in the united states and europe , who will examine it for 40 different trace chemicals related to climate , some in parts per quadrillion .
so , what would our natural rhythm look like ?
and in summer , it &apos;s almost manic hunting and working activity very long hours , very active .
and a couple of things struck me about this .
so what we want you to do is re-plan our entire building , and we know it &apos;s going to cost several million pounds , but we &apos;re reconciled to the fact . &quot; &quot; and the team thought about this , and they went away , and they said , &quot; &quot; actually , don &apos;t do that .
he looks like this .
but fun is not enough .
ap : ground control to major tom , ag : five , four , three , two , one ... ap : commencing countdown , engines on .
and there &apos;s nothing i can do .
in 2010 , unitaid established the medicines patent pool for hiv .
nelson decided to become a treatment activist and join up with other groups .
then you see his left leg .
so water was something that scared me to begin with .
we need to reestablish local involvement in our own forests .
so grandpa ran up with his shovel to rescue the poor dog .
in about 30 days or so they &apos;ll be connected to the greenlab .
we can make that happen , inexpensively .
you have to have dosimeter at all times , clicking away , you have to have a government minder , and there &apos;s draconian radiation rules and constant contamination monitoring .
but then , i looked into the distance , and i saw some smoke coming from a farmhouse , and i &apos;m thinking , who could be living here ?
i &apos;m interested in systems and networks and where we can concentrate our resources to do the most good .
she heads to a campus party where she sees a guy that she has a crush on .
many of you will realize that i &apos;m ripping a bit off of the science fiction writer vernor vinge &apos;s notion of a technological singularity , where a number of trends accelerate and converge and come together to create , really , a shockingly new reality .
they &apos;re betting a visible competition , a prize , can attract talent and money to some of the most difficult issues , and thereby speed the solution .
i &apos;m reminded of that every time i walk past highbury fields in north london .
it won &apos;t surprise you guys that brasilia has five times the pedestrian accident rate of your average us city .
they generate milliwatts , or microwatts .
so this changes the way , again , in which we think about robots .
you find muscular tubes , modified legs , modified fins , as well as the mammalian fleshy , inflatable cylinder that we &apos;re all familiar with — or at least half of you are .
it has a central space of spongy erectile tissue that fills with fluid — in this case blood — surrounded by a wall of tissue that &apos;s rich in a stiff structural protein called collagen .
increasingly , we &apos;re using mobile devices , and we interact on the go .
so when we &apos;re working together in person , i &apos;m not only looking at your face but i &apos;m also gesturing and manipulating objects , and that &apos;s really hard to do when you &apos;re using tools like skype .
fast-forward to pennsylvania , where i find myself today .
the problem then becomes how do you take seventh- and eighth-graders to a talk about genocide and deal with the subject in a way that is responsible and respectful , and they know what to do with it .
space is something that folds out of itself into completely new worlds .
by the way , it is a story that is told through its hard materials .
when i looked into the face of a newborn , i caught a glimpse of that worthiness , that sense of unapologetic selfhood , that unique spark .
the same happened for me .
but we found ourselves lagging in the mid &apos; 90s in the creature and character design stuff that we had actually founded the company to do .
and it really made me realize that the telepresence experience — that you actually can have these robotic avatars , then your consciousness is injected into the vehicle , into this other form of existence .
it was a dimly lit shack .
we want peace . &quot; &quot; and i realized it had to come from the people .
it was accidentally released from the aquarium in monaco , it was bred to be cold tolerant to have in peoples aquaria .
i &apos;m an ecologist , mostly a coral reef ecologist .
people are understanding , from cairo to oakland , that there are new ways to come together , there are new ways to mobilize , there are new ways to influence .
but haiti provided us with something else unprecedented .
when i assign values to the vertical and horizontal elements , i can use the changes of those data points over time to create the form .
these forms are completely made up of weather data or science data .
so i was thinking , can you remove us as creators and try to make the music be the voice and have the animation following it ?
so they get tired , has come dark and rain ; they get weary and tired .
and they said , you know , &quot; &quot; jamie , plm , can you guys tell us whether this works or not ? &quot; &quot; and we went around and we talked to people , and they said , &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t run a clinical trial like this . you know ?
each of them can have a different characteristic .
look at the sky .
we just think of the weather , and even with the weather , we don &apos;t think of all the many nuances of weather .
this is where we need to make our voices heard .
how cheap ?
we don &apos;t see it on facebook . we don &apos;t see it on twitter .
we &apos;re people , and we have problems .
thank you very much .
( laughter ) i have solidified the beam of the laser pointer . ( laughter )
we can &apos;t know what &apos;s going on in — let alone an insect &apos;s — another human being &apos;s mind .
and there is as many different kinds of pollen as there are flowering plants .
and as you do that , you will find that miracles happen on a regular basis .
and the only thing that &apos;s different between you now and where you were 10 years ago is what is the particular &quot; &quot; if &quot; &quot; that you were focusing on ?
no coincidence that the president of the strongest nation on earth is half-kenyan , partly raised in indonesia , has a chinese-canadian brother-in-law .
and i thought back to that wonderful phrase i had learned as a boy from seneca , in which he says , &quot; &quot; that man is poor not who has little but who hankers after more . &quot; &quot; and , of course , i &apos;m not suggesting that anybody here go into a monastery .
imagine you &apos;re in an enormous room , and it &apos;s as dark as a cave .
so you have living dinosaurs and space aliens , animals that evolved in zero gravity in harsh conditions .
you know all about big brains .
and 100 pages later .
and to me , this is research misconduct .
so that &apos;s not all of the trials that were ever conducted on these drugs , because we can never know if we have those , but it is the ones that were conducted in order to get the marketing authorization .
and if you took a drop of that water , you might find a million diarrheal organisms .
i mean , if this would require thousands of years , then it &apos;s worthless in terms of controlling of these pathogens .
and i claim that what happened was the sudden emergence of a sophisticated mirror neuron system , which allowed you to emulate and imitate other people &apos;s actions .
( applause )
he said , &quot; &quot; we have a community that owns its own company . &quot; &quot; and then my all-time favorite , etsy .
this peers , inc. concept is in a very difficult and complex realm .
this student &apos;s made an alarm clock you wrestle to prove you &apos;re awake ; this is one that defends — a dress that defends your personal space .
so this program has split into an ngo foundation , a fab foundation to support the scaling , a micro vc fund .
so these stories together became the herald tribune business cover .
just think of the benefits when it comes to jobs , productivity , employment , child nutrition , maternal mortality , literacy and much , much more .
so there you have it : the evolution of a headline .
and i think a lot of scientists have this attitude .
it turns out it is also used on twitter when people are role-playing as dogs .
there &apos;s more in that picture than just a cat .
if you want to know the reason why i &apos;m standing here , it &apos;s because of education .
and he urged the people in that meeting , in that community , to devote themselves to closing the gap between those two ideas , to work together to try to make the world as it is and the world as it should be , one and the same .
( laughter ) sr : are you convinced ?
so it will not allow us to control a memory in real time .
but then somebody actually launched this start-up called matternet , where they figured out that you could use this to actually transport things from one village to another in africa , and the fact that this was easy to find , open-source , easy to hack , enabled them to prototype their company really quickly .
actually , i argue that there is another revolution going on , and it &apos;s the one that has to do with open-source hardware and the maker &apos;s movement , because the printer that my friend used to print the toy is actually open-source .
the foreboding sheen of an extra-large date .
( laughter ) this sound colors our first impression of any room ; it can &apos;t be helped .
this is a symbol of what we can achieve when we believe in the impossible , when we have a team , when we have pioneering spirit , and especially when we understand that all the certainties we have should be thrown overboard .
it &apos;s not designed by an artist , but it could be .
so the one on the top likes to fire sort of midway between the walls of the box that their rat &apos;s in .
and scientists have begun to understand how spatial memory works by recording from individual neurons in rats or mice while they forage or explore an environment looking for food .
and as you know , everybody loves that , too .
you can &apos;t ask them to repeat every single word .
and we &apos;ve used it to drive antioxidant genes from resurrection plants .
like seeds , these are desiccation-tolerant .
there was no water . there was no energy , no oil , no cars , none of that .
what did it do ?
it &apos;s more of a choreography of the viewer &apos;s attention .
but where do we go from here ?
so it was an argument about the cause of mountains .
so this is a picture of henry cadell , who was a scottish geologist in the 19th century .
possibility .
do you know what your lover is going to do tomorrow ?
we have reached peak child .
so low income here , high income there .
clearly , we &apos;re living in a moment of crisis .
it was about 115 degrees .
there &apos;s probably never been a drug-free society .
virtually every society has ingested psychoactive substances to deal with pain , increase our energy , socialize , even commune with god .
it &apos;s very , very simple . it &apos;s not rocket science .
i traveled enormously as a child .
( music ) his name was lothar , lothar meggendorfer .
they realized that , in 6,000 years of storytelling , they &apos;ve gone from depicting hunting on cave walls to depicting shakespeare on facebook walls .
but why have we not any plantoid ?
but plants are also able to show a lot of movement .
the best way to help africans today is to help them to stand on their own feet .
so all the changes and reforms we were able to make have shown up in results that are measurable in the economy .
and that can &apos;t just be something that &apos;s left to our schools , although that &apos;s important to begin at an early age .
was it something that took place overnight ?
unprotected bamboo weathers .
it lives off of rainwater , spring water , sunlight , and of the 1,450 species of bamboo that grow across the world , we use just seven of them .
and it seemed to me that there were three levels of acceptance that needed to take place .
she said that might mean that he had brain damage .
all the natural products become a natural resource again .
and this is how we create a 100-year-old forest in just 10 years .
and not only is mobile the gold of today , i don &apos;t believe that the gold is under the ground .
actually it &apos;s the smartphone of africa .
i used to think i shouldn &apos;t eat anything which is conscious , so therefore i should be vegetarian .
it has 3d vision and surround sound for what you &apos;re seeing and hearing right now , but that &apos;s just the start of it .
in principle , you could imagine to find sand dunes of any slope angle in a beach , and yet , the slope angles of sand dunes are typically around 30 , 35 degrees .
so is this how humanity is going to disappear ?
instead of using electrical motors , electromechanical actuators , we &apos;re using compressed air .
i directly run to my home office , sit at my computer , i type in the ideas , i sketch things out and i keep a database of ideas .
and finally , from teach for america , i learned that a class is not primarily about information .
a student said , &quot; &quot; this class felt like sitting in a bar with a really smart friend who &apos;s explaining something you haven &apos;t grasped , but are about to . &quot; &quot; and that &apos;s exactly what we were aiming for .
and we chose to try to reverse sprawl through three simple moves — expensive , but simple .
but culturally , we tend to think that downtowns should be dynamic , and we expect that .
good job ! yeah !
dm : and now i &apos;ll attach the filter to the bass for some more expression . video : ( music )
he helped us understand that social media &apos;s becoming social production .
and scientists that have studied this have said they &apos;ve never seen an accident .
now , the irony is , it &apos;s probably sold in our supermarket shelves in the twin cities .
well , this is a lot of water , and again , we &apos;re mining water and using it to grow food , and today , if you travel down further down the colorado , it dries up completely and no longer flows into the ocean .
thermostat designers decided to add a new step .
our challenge is to get back there , to feel that frustration , to see those little details , to look broader , look closer , and to think younger so we can stay beginners .
migrating eastward , following the grasslands , because that &apos;s what they were adapted to live on .
in &quot; &quot; the descent of man , &quot; &quot; he wrote , &quot; &quot; in each great region of the world , the living mammals are closely related to the extinct species of the same region .
in 2003 , they had 300,000 employees , or 330,000 employees , out of which , 135,000 were in america , 9,000 were in india .
so we started examining the r &amp; d and innovation labs of silicon valley .
just over 30 years ago , the nations of the world assembled at alma-ata and made this iconic declaration .
the actual number is about 3,000 , about two percent of that number .
i had no joke for that .
( laughter ) and i think it &apos;s good to talk about things i know nothing about because i bring a fresh viewpoint to it , you know ?
when you eat healthier , manage stress , exercise and love more , your brain actually gets more blood flow and more oxygen .
we &apos;ve shown that you can actually reverse heart disease .
in the next decade ?
because the social progress index also has some very good news .
it &apos;s also moving vertically .
and where , at the nation state level that power is held to accountability subject to the rule of law , on the international stage it is not .
that &apos;s my question for a hologram .
jn : well , i &apos;m actually in three places .
and these contributions are far from equal .
it &apos;s a very simple genetically inherited trait and the males are not otherwise any different .
they search for them . they find them in flower .
it &apos;s no good storing the seeds if you don &apos;t know they &apos;re still viable .
and there they had a detention camp where alleged vietnamese would be tested , language tested .
and we end up in hong ngu on the vietnamese side .
i was actually interfering with the process with lots of good intentions .
the first one is that in life we encounter many people who , in some way or another , try to tattoo our faces .
and besides , skylines are highly specific urban habitats with their own insects , plants and animals , and even their own weather .
they look at how all the diverse parts of the ecosystem are interconnected , and it &apos;s actually this balance , this web of life , that sustains life .
i don &apos;t believe we should .
so let &apos;s look at how china is re-establishing that hierarchy in the far east .
and we &apos;re also their closest cousin .
the chimps are actually interacting with each other through the computers .
they seemed to see me in terms of their assumptions of what it must be like to be in a wheelchair .
i literally have the freedom to move in 360 degrees of space and an ecstatic experience of joy and freedom .
you see , we were all outside when the contamination came down .
that &apos;s my default .
ladies and gentlemen , that was in 1984 in the united states , and i wish i had twitter .
and it is his spirit and his optimism that is in my dna .
and i started thinking about it again .
but as you can see , orders can come and go , products can come and go .
now this sounds a little theoretical , but it &apos;s not so theoretical .
we have interviews , we have surveys .
so what &apos;s interesting about these new power values and these new power models is what they mean for organizations .
if you &apos;re dating someone and you just want to say &quot; &quot; i miss you &quot; &quot; you leave them a missed call .
i worked and studied hard to move up the career ladder , eventually becoming a chief financial officer in silicon valley , a job i really enjoyed .
thank you .
he has given us the possibility to have dreams and to make true the dreams .
( applause ) ( music ) ( applause ) gustavo dudamel : hi everybody in l.a.
north central india , the chambal river is where we have our base .
but it &apos;s possibly , and definitely not enough .
all the sculptures move by mechanical means .
and i &apos;ll cut some wood and drill some holes and watch the water , and maybe i &apos;ll have to walk around and look for washers .
larry brilliant : should we feel good , or should we feel bad that 50 years of foreknowledge accomplished so little ?
for some , it will lead to anger , religious and sectarian violence and terrorism .
the protesters who occupied maidan , as the square is known , prepared for battle , stockpiling homemade weapons and mass-producing improvised body armor .
they came day after day and they covered the square with millions of flowers .
music lovers and jazz lovers alike , please give a warm hand of applause for the one and only mr. peeping tom . take it away .
so i do a lot of my work outside brisbane and outside australia , and so the pursuit of this crazy passion of mine has enabled me to see so many amazing places in the world .
the other way that they are better is actually being able to resolve different levels of gray .
i &apos;m going to ask you to participate , so you &apos;re going to have to actually play the game with me . i &apos;m going to show you colored words . i want you to shout out the color of the ink .
grab that issue , sit it down in front of you , look straight in its eyes , and tell it there is no christmas this year .
we will never get your issue solved until we fix this issue first .
the world of vaccines is getting better .
so that gives you an idea of the nanopatch , and immediately you can see some key advantages .
we &apos;ve discovered over 350 in the last 14 years , including the small planet , announced earlier this week , which has a radius just twice the size of the earth .
and the nearest star is 4.2 light years away , which means its light takes 4.2 years to get here .
now , i &apos;m actually fairly optimistic that this problem can be solved .
there are also size limitations , like a human brain has to fit inside a cranium , but a computer can be the size of a warehouse or larger .
they &apos;d looked at dental calculus under a microscope , and what they had found was things like pollen and plant starches , and they &apos;d found muscle cells from animal meats and bacteria .
and we even find it in neanderthals and animals .
before i left , i actually asked him if i could get him something .
i photographed her before and after the birth of her beautiful baby girl , issa .
knowing somebody &apos;s your kin typically kills the libido .
in particular , &quot; &quot; the supper at emmaus &quot; &quot; which was viewed as vermeer &apos;s finest masterpiece , his best work — people would come &#91; from &#93; all over the world to see it — was actually a forgery .
people have tried very hard to do this .
and in fact , i think we &apos;re even wrong when we talk about cancer as a thing .
i &apos;m going to start really , really simply .
so all i &apos;m doing is exploring this space of &quot; &quot; t &quot; &quot; and flashing through it with some action .
does anyone recognize this ? in fact , they do .
they assumed two percent , and that made it a pretty hopeless story , because population growth was two and a half .
i &apos;ve got a 30-second experiment that will push you past your comfort zone .
tonight , just on our service , 785,000 people in 191 countries will either stay in a stranger &apos;s home or welcome one into theirs .
these are q-tips stuck to my roommate with wig glue .
i feel like i have all these ideas existing embedded inside of me , and it &apos;s these conversations and these experiences that connect these ideas , and they kind of instinctively come out .
and when i looked at it first , i thought , no , there &apos;s no beauty in that .
or the information &apos;s added on at the back , like that little girl &apos;s drawing that i showed you .
and so , i remember that my first major piece of software was on a direct copy of then-aldus pagemaker .
i was , like , aha , wait a second .
but you don &apos;t always have to go down to the depths of the ocean to see a light show like this .
so , most animals make blue light , and most animals can only see blue light , but this fish is a really fascinating exception because it has two red light organs .
and after all , it has its own internal aesthetics .
( laughter ) it &apos;s also enabled me to conduct what i think is the world &apos;s first human slime mold experiment .
one exception is in massachusetts .
in cites , about 80 percent of people have someone whom they consider a neighbor of another race , but in rural communities , only about 30 percent .
but during studies of dysfunction , data revealed an unexpected insight : that even the worst circumstances can result in growth and transformation .
eventually , he quit .
i had a bit of an epiphany being lost in pennsylvania , and i took a left turn trying to get back to the highway .
so i started thinking , well , we live in all these ages of man : the stone age , and the iron age , and the copper age .
they dropped it , they walked away , but they were arrested .
there , we have agreed-upon , fairly clear benchmarks , and we have laws of nature to guide us .
so if i were to give you a hypothesis , it would be that a smart guy started this page , or maybe one of the first people who liked it would have scored high on that test .
it &apos;s doing science that allowed us to develop all these mechanisms for computing this personal data in the first place .
and more importantly , once i embraced the shake , i realized i could still make art .
there were times when my projects failed to get off the ground , or , even worse , after spending tons of time on them the end image was kind of embarrassing .
a couple of years into the process , i spent a lot of time in europe traveling around , looking for design .
red is a color in the landscape that is often on stop signs .
that is a huge failure rate .
and since i started talking about this subject and researching this subject , i &apos;ve been really haunted by something a japanese mathematician said on the subject .
when will it catch up ? i have to go back to very conventional graph .
no , there is one more inequity . look there , united states .
our educational systems are inherited from the 19th century .
if we are to call the tyranny of assumptions into question , and avoid doxa , the realm of the unquestioned , then we must be willing to subject our own assumptions to debate and discussion .
and when i first came across it in the early &apos; 90s , i thought my predecessor , malcolm dyson and bob wright , had really taken leave of their senses , and i ’ ll explain to you why this was the case .
now , this is a spectroscope , ok , on my laboratory bench .
and you put yourself into a state of panic where you don &apos;t know , and so you don &apos;t know .
a story is our — all of us — we are the stories we tell ourselves .
and here is the work of two brothers from sao paulo , fernando and humberto campana , who got inspired by the poverty and smartness that they saw around them to do pieces of furniture that now are selling for an enormous amount of money .
and when you do that , usually you get 80 percent porn and 20 percent real suggestions , and instead it was all — almost — all good suggestions .
most of them are pirated . they have the name brand on them , but they &apos;re not manufactured by the name brand .
and it &apos;s not just in africa .
i can remember someone saying this to me , with her eyes shining with enthusiasm at this wonderful confirmation of her faith and the goodness of god .
is god just another name for the universe , with no independent existence at all ?
this is because , in the mid-area here , people are at their most active , and over here they &apos;re at their most frail .
but even in this limited view , we can do a lot of things .
but the spatial evolution in video games is extremely important .
we don &apos;t want to show the video games with the paraphernalia . no arcade nostalgia .
and what is it specifically about creative ventures that seems to make us really nervous about each other &apos;s mental health in a way that other careers kind of don &apos;t do , you know ?
the result of which is that everywhere i go now , people treat me like i &apos;m doomed .
all this fancy technology but they can &apos;t afford heat .
dude , can you , all right , can you just keep it down ?
but i have a confession to make : that phrase drives me nuts .
was it working in the sun ?
( applause ) okay . the point is it &apos;s really hard to tell , isn &apos;t it ? it &apos;s incredible , we looked at students do this and they couldn &apos;t tell .
and the constraints in building any organism , when you look at it , are really severe . natural technologies have incredible constraints .
in particular , nobody wants an operation with tools like these through large incisions that cause a lot of pain , that cause a lot of time out of work or out of school , that leave a big scar .
we do about five million of these in the united states and maybe 20 million of these worldwide .
it &apos;s a huge amount of data .
so we &apos;ve spent a lot of time and effort in turning the data into stories to be able to tell , what &apos;s the state of the engine , how are the tires degrading , what &apos;s the situation with fuel consumption ?
and dane saw the strife that happened as a result of this .
should you know ?
it comes out of the ground like a train .
they &apos;re part of the rice cycle and these skills will be valuable for them in their future .
so , i think we have an answer to our question .
and much of the conversation is , can we build it ?
as the koran promises , patience is rewarded , and there are many surprises — a degree of environmental awareness , for instance , and of humans as mere stewards of god &apos;s creation , unmatched in the bible .
the koran declares that it comes to renew the message of the torah and the gospels .
tell me what &apos;s wrong . i can &apos;t understand you .
so one day , i &apos;m out in front of the house doing something — just playing around , doing something — i don &apos;t know what .
now it &apos;s using a faster group of three we call a triplet .
it has four quarter notes .
interpreter : this is a joint effort between me and french artist jr .
what will making myself invisible here cause people to think ?
i didn &apos;t consider how many times we would each have to make that choice , and how many times i will continue to have to make that choice without knowing whether or not he will always choose me .
sounds romantic , doesn &apos;t it ?
she stabs it with a stinger that is a sense organ equipped with small sensory bumps that allow her to feel the distinctive texture of a roach &apos;s brain .
it has no consciousness .
but anything above here , if it &apos;s murky , i can already feel it right now .
this blew my mind . how does this even exist ?
my dried bones are prized as a sort of ivory .
i went to the washington zoo .
( applause )
well , traditional definition is &quot; &quot; an organism to which exogenous components have been added for the purpose of adapting to new environments . &quot; &quot; that came from a 1960 paper on space travel , because , if you think about it , space is pretty awkward .
so it &apos;s important to remember that whether it &apos;s good or it &apos;s bad , &quot; this too shall pass . &quot;
okay , so now the start to finish timing has to be perfect .
they come from us .
with two paychecks , or three paychecks , i could solve a lot of my family &apos;s problems .
she chased that big seal away , went and got its penguin and brought it to me .
they are 12 ft. long , a thousand pounds .
well , i don &apos;t know . there were tasmanians who were discovered around the 1600s and they had no fire .
and it &apos;s used for communication .
it &apos;s also a step towards taking responsibility for my own burden on the planet .
second , we are both responsible for and the victims of our own pollution .
i &apos;m short sighted . i look at the signs at the end , i can hardly see them .
so this little slide here shows you an optometrist and the little blue person represents about 10,000 people and that &apos;s the ratio in the u.k.
fallout shelter for the climate crisis , i would say , looks something like this , or this , which is an intensive urban agriculture facility that &apos;s due to go on my lab building at nyu .
that is , share your lunch .
so i &apos;ve got a camera pointing down at this plate , and underneath that plate , there is a magnet .
let me now turn to the last project , which involves the national beverage of scotland .
and we need all the help we can get from others , because we are stewards of a precious pale blue dot in a vast cosmos , a planet with 50 million centuries ahead of it .
scenario a wipes out 90 percent of humanity .
my wife gets fed up with me constantly trying to push emissions up her agenda . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) or , any south africans , we have mandela to inspire .
so , there &apos;s him . in britain we have prince charles : &quot; &quot; and the environment is so important , all we can do .
about three or four years ago , i got a phone call in the middle of the night from that teacher , mrs. posten , who said , &quot; &quot; i need to see you .
it &apos;s something we knew how to do .
but then — ok , when ted started , there was no web so things like &quot; &quot; click &quot; &quot; didn &apos;t have the same meaning .
well , in those documents , there are little squares , little boxes .
hello , my name is thomas heatherwick .
and the mayor of kuala lumpur said that , if this developer would give something that gave something back to the city , they would give them more gross floor area , buildable .
at some point i &apos;m going to get out . &quot; &quot; and their fears completely changed , and their fears were not about , &quot; &quot; am i going to get killed ? &quot; &quot; their fears were , &quot; &quot; am i going to be rejected ?
captain valdez was the first high-ranking official to give us the helicopters and the support we needed to put these christmas trees up , and he said in that meeting something that i will never forget .
i can &apos;t go back to my area — it &apos;s more than 1,000 kilometers &#91; away &#93; .
all my friends said , we are leaving because we are a target .
i &apos;d like to end with a few verses of what i wrote at my father &apos;s cremation .
so maybe we all need to leave our children with a value legacy , and not a financial one .
but the right-hand part of the molecule is a little bit different in every single species .
and the way bacteria make a living is that they consume nutrients from the environment , they grow to twice their size , they cut themselves down in the middle , and one cell becomes two , and so on and so on .
it &apos;s a fact .
what keeps you sustaining your work , sustaining the fight for equality , extending it , always exploring new areas , trying to find new ways ... ?
where i work , in the arab region , people are busy taking up western innovations and changing them into things which are neither conventionally western , nor are they traditionally islamic .
yes . that &apos;s right . this is barbie .
i have a tape of yours at home . &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; well , i &apos;m in truro , &quot; &quot; which is where i was , and he asked me out for supper .
( audience reaction ) dl : you start . nm : no , you have to start , because you &apos;ve got to do your thing .
and that &apos;s my little workshop .
there &apos;s kind of the skin version of the soft tissue .
in fact , i &apos;ve developed some interesting tools to help me deal with this fear .
( laughter ) i was afraid of womanhood .
they like social security . they like medicare .
and so what this tells me is , when you look at the discussion of how to resolve our fiscal problems , we are not a nation that &apos;s powerfully divided on the major , major issue .
combine the power of a global ethic with the power of our ability to communicate and organize globally , with the challenges that we now face , most of which are global in their nature .
one of the things that has got to come out of copenhagen in the next few months is an agreement that there will be a global environmental institution that is able to deal with the problems of persuading the whole of the world to move along a climate-change agenda .
and we get to the receptionist , and we say , &quot; we &apos;re here for the lunch . &quot;
( applause ) i know how we got here .
now we can be well-balanced in our biorhythm with daylight .
so , in this office , you do not work anymore at your desk , like a politician .
with brainstorming we make you happy , we play games , and we say , &quot; &quot; no criticism , &quot; &quot; and you get all these weird , neat ideas .
and it &apos;s beautiful — it &apos;s in the museum of modern art .
i suspect , actually , that the evolutionary biologists probably have lots of reasons &#91; for &#93; why we want to categorize new things very , very quickly .
that ’ s what it is , isn ’ t it ? of course it is , of course it is .
they were amazing — like you can see here .
fashion is also a very physical thing .
so , that &apos;s just one use . incredible , there is probably 350 , 400 uses .
they are just incredibly expensive .
my name is abdul khan . i come from peshawar .
and that is why i want to illuminate the world .
i &apos;ll have the opportunity to see you graduate .
what else have i learned ?
and not everybody on death row was a political prisoner .
i &apos;d been there twice , and i was terribly afraid that i was going to die .
none of the haikus were written by the same person .
should have done this before i tried to pitch it .
the great sam gross cartoon , this happened after the muhammad controversy where it &apos;s muhammad in heaven , the suicide bomber is all in little pieces , and he &apos;s saying to the suicide bomber , &quot; you &apos;ll get the virgins when we find your penis . &quot;
how many people know what this cartoon means ?
softball players see the ball as smaller if they &apos;ve just come out of a slump , compared to people who had a hot night at the plate .
we might see something entirely different , because perception is subjective .
first , you have to offer them confidentiality .
we have never met a single human being in the world who can make it , sell it and look after the money .
rl : congress is a big body .
that is a hugely costly set of activities that &apos;s going on right now .
shipping is as crucial to us as it has ever been .
i want to salute the 100,000 ships that are at sea that are doing that work , coming in and out every day , bringing us what we need .
i even finished my credits on time and graduated with my class .
i know this because i am one of them .
in the measure that you have the code and the measure that you read it — and , by the way , the first plant was read two years ago ; the first human was read two years ago ; the first insect was read two years ago .
and very soon it &apos;s going to matter if you &apos;re literate in life code .
i said that , &quot; &quot; we are going to win .
everything was going bad .
i mean , there was no doubt that amy and i and salaam all had this love for this gospel , soul and blues and jazz that was evident listening to the musical arrangements .
tm : we all love music a great deal .
why not put some of yourself into the work ?
it wasn &apos;t some , you know , weird grunge type or something ; it looked like they might be real . anyway .
the whole thing took two days out of the seven-day week .
that comes out at five to 10 tons daily per square mile in cities .
i can cut any way i want to , so i cut right here .
so we call this anatomage table .
and it had a chilling effect on me .
and toward the end of writing that book there was a documentary that came out .
i know you understand that .
i &apos;m in thongs and sarongs . it was many years ago .
it was just going 65 — to zero ?
they can have a precise idea of where they are , and sort of a vague idea of where the other cars are .
robots are the most human of our machines .
and i never forgot the robot that he and i tried to build .
behind every window and door frame , you &apos;ll see a small child peering back at you , and while makoko seems to be packed with people , what &apos;s more shocking is actually the amount of children pouring out of every building .
being constantly on the move means that sometimes i am able to catch life &apos;s most unpredictable moments , like here in new york the day after the sandy storm hit the city .
and that &apos;s exactly the same problem for chemotherapy and pancreatic cancer .
however , although it &apos;s very , very sad this news , it &apos;s also thanks to their personal stories that we have raised awareness of how lethal this disease can be .
if i could summarize this in one sentence , it would be this : mathematics is not just solving for x , it &apos;s also figuring out why .
( laughter ) fibonacci ! of course .
this was 300 bc .
let &apos;s look at agriculture . let &apos;s look at forestry .
max has kindly donated his photograph to me .
but when we change people &apos;s faces , are we changing their identity — for better or for worse ?
except for my son , who said , &quot; &quot; well , he could have two dads . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) ( applause ) that &apos;s an index , an indicator of how things have changed .
data from psychologists and sociologists are quite persuasive here .
he has a selective one , though .
the chance for greatness , for progress and for change dies the moment we try to be like someone else .
so we &apos;ve been looking at the idea of competition as a way of cooperating in order to get fit together .
in 1984 , we did the first so-called &quot; &quot; green office &quot; &quot; in america for environmental defense .
when i saw aicha in the media , coming over when her son was indicted , and i thought , &quot; &quot; what a brave woman .
my son , i don &apos;t know where he is .
so the media was filled with stories about all the horrific deeds that indian men are capable of .
in fact , so alien and unthinkable was this event in an indian mind that the response from the indian media , public and politicians proved one point : no one knew what to do .
did you know that one year of the world &apos;s military spending equals 700 years of the u.n. budget and equals 2,928 years of the u.n. budget allocated for women ?
it was deep at night .
and so we &apos;re looking at mechanisms in plants such as phototropism , which causes the plant to grow towards the sun by producing hormones like auxin , which causes cell elongation on the shady side .
can you imagine what it would say about the work-life balance at your office if these were standard issue on the first day ?
this actually forms a large part of our decision-making process .
now smile to go straight .
through a program of observational research , brainstorming new solutions and rapid prototyping , they &apos;ve developed a completely new way to change shift .
there is a hash tag there that you can use , # cbdq .
i would daydream about traveling the world , living in a place where it snowed , and i would picture all of the stories that i would go on to tell .
and yes , i can change my toenail polish .
if we go on increasing those concentrations , we risk temperatures over the next century or so that we have not seen on this planet for tens of millions of years .
that &apos;s really important .
and the crux of the matter was , however , getting more from less .
time for development , not 10 years .
it &apos;s changing on days &apos; time scales with human activity .
yes , we built our first satellite prototype in our garage .
non-technical , non-biologist amateurs play a video game in which they visually rearrange the structure of the protein , allowing the computer to manage the atomic forces and interactions and identify structural issues .
these foreign fighters had left their families in the gulf , the levant and north africa to join al qaeda in iraq .
you need to learn their motivations and points of view .
in the process , i became a civil society diplomat .
and i can light up the nutmeg like a beacon .
a 1930s ship &apos;s lifeboat , which i &apos;ve been restoring in the garden of my beach house in england .
amos winter : and thank you very much for having me today .
( applause )
and because we cannot do it on our own , we &apos;ve developed a very fancy authoring tool that any author , any parent or actually anyone who has an interest in math education , can use this authoring tool to develop similar apps on tablets without programming .
the driving force behind this project is my colleague shmulik london , and , you see , just like salman did about 90 years ago , the trick is to surround yourself with brilliant people , because at the end , it &apos;s all about people .
and in the following months and years , i felt the neurological flow of life itself returning .
i don &apos;t have the ability to control my left foot .
sometimes i used to walk more at night .
im : i feel like it needs to be a little closer down here .
in summary , instead of our students learning about the techniques of calculus , i think it would be far more significant if all of them knew what two standard deviations from the mean means . and i mean it .
it &apos;s analyzing trends . it &apos;s predicting the future .
have you ever made a small , weird sound when you remembered something embarrassing ?
have you ever woken up blissfully and suddenly been flooded by the awful remembrance that someone had left you ?
same thing happened in offices .
but fear of losing jobs to technology has been around for a long time .
but , who cares ? i don &apos;t want an ad in the new yorker , and most of these workers don &apos;t really want iphones .
we must be peculiarly self-obsessed to imagine that we have the power to drive tens of millions of people on the other side of the world to migrate and suffer in such terrible ways .
the chinese believe certain animals get on better than the others .
( laughter ) if you are a goat , please don &apos;t feel bad .
and so , just relax your hand .
what happens ?
and i &apos;m disturbed by this because i &apos;ve been openly gay now for quite some time .
now , i &apos;m sitting here trying to figure out &quot; &quot; the gay lifestyle , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gay lifestyle , &quot; &quot; and i keep hearing this word over and over and over again : lifestyle , lifestyle , lifestyle .
&quot; you cared about me , and you changed my life . &quot;
the staggering inefficiency is what drove me to criminal justice work .
( laughter ) ca : did he tell you to jump , or he just said , &quot; &quot; i &apos;m out of here ! &quot; &quot; and ...
rb : well , of course , the pr experts said that as an airline owner , the last thing you should be doing is heading off in balloons and boats , and crashing into the seas .
we &apos;ve seen perceptual shifts in the mormon community that allow for talk of gender inequality .
from paper routes and babysitting , i donated 10 percent .
now , what do these medium , large , mega- , and hypercities look like ?
we &apos;ve got to bring those fragile cities into the conversation .
blockchains allow us to write code , binding contracts , between individuals and then guarantee that those contracts will bear out without a third party enforcer .
this is a whole new world in terms of our visibility .
and millions and millions of students take these tests every year .
now this is the major change that i &apos;ve seen — how teaching english has morphed from being a mutually beneficial practice to becoming a massive international business that it is today .
we have to stop .
right now , her favorite character is groot .
so i &apos;m going to share with you some coverages that i feel demonstrate the storytelling power of photography .
i can see his hands reaching out , and i can see his face in terror , looking at me , saying , &quot; &quot; help me , dad . &quot; &quot; i got him . the wave broke over us .
now , in this state of de-animation , it could not go out dancing , but it was not dead , and it was not harmed .
it was a television show — it was a nova show on pbs — about caves in new mexico .
in 2005 , we launched our first slate of films , &quot; murder ball , &quot; &quot; north country , &quot; &quot; syriana &quot; and &quot; &quot; good night and good luck . &quot; &quot; and much to my surprise , they were noticed .
people today we call social entrepreneurs .
but look here . instead of blowing tanks and coming up slowly without thinking about it , it ’ s a little bit of back pressure , and that sub just comes straight back up out of the water .
i don ’ t really look that ugly , but the camera is so close that it ’ s just distorted .
and we just keep telling ourselves , and we do it all the time .
we need an exercise .
and over the course of the next eight or nine days , they resigned themselves to what was happening .
legendary — as in ted williams legendary — the last major league baseball player to hit over 400 during a regular season .
the first building was the house of uncle ibrahim .
and standing exactly at this point every day made my realize the symbolism behind this anamorphic piece .
i found out that they had a very hard time dealing with frustration and difficulties — not because they were physically unfit .
and he ended up in south tel aviv and did not have the good luck to be picked up by a &#91; unclear &#93; and roamed the streets and became a prominent gang member .
when people find out i write about time management , they assume two things .
but you can write it .
and they came into my room the next morning .
we all are products of our childhood experiences .
and so now all the birds come in . and i have hawks .
i have had the distinct pleasure of living inside two biospheres .
that &apos;s what &apos;s so complicated about war .
combat they did learn to like .
so even though we &apos;ve lost 30 percent of the colonies every year , the same number of colonies have existed in the country , at about 2.4 million colonies .
and i hope that you experience it and i hope you tell me about it one day .
( applause )
i was born in poland , now in the u.s.
