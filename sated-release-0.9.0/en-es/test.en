but what about ourselves , and what about our reality ?
so this is a project i &apos;m working on , and this is a series of front covers to downgrade our super , hyper — ( laughter ) ( applause ) to downgrade our super , hyper-mobile phones into the essence of their function .
that &apos;s the building .
i &apos;m going with you , man . &quot; &quot; and she turned that audience around on a pin .
there are oil tankers cars going by .
and this happens regularly during the highest-tide tides now .
just imagine , if you have a computer and a printer and you want to transmit , to input to print out a document , but the printer doesn &apos;t have the right drives , so the same is for mario .
francesca fedeli : ciao .
you see the sunbeams coming from the ventilation ducts and the train approaching .
that homeless man , to me , really represented an element of the unconscious of the city .
well , the conventional approach to post-conflict situations has rested on , on kind of , three principles .
but it needs to be done long-term .
at least one will .
if you do so , that idea will be in demand and , moreover , it will be brand new .
aa : when they got bored with their father &apos;s project , they invented an extraordinary little plane of their own .
tm : oh , 10 , 11 . ( aa : oh my god . ) tm : 12 , something like that . ( aa : that &apos;s amazing . ) pm : and tyler &apos;s here to show you the walkalong .
now , the ideology of choice is very successful in opening for us a space to think about some imagined future .
&quot; sperm donor ? what &apos;s the rush ? &quot;
and all i &apos;m saying is that i really wish that murray gell-mann would go on oprah and just explain to her that the law of attraction is , in fact , not a law .
and then the pilot didn &apos;t go and i was so sad , but i kept remaining a fan of yours .
people will say to you , &quot; you look great . have you had any work done ? &quot;
does it have the apple logo on it ?
let &apos;s call it income-based tuition or ibt .
one that linked up the cost of a major to the expected income .
and from 1949 to 1985 was an extraordinary time of a buildup of a nuclear arsenal that no one could possibly have imagined back in the 1940s .
and the farther you are away in distance , the longer it is in time from the initial blast ; and the more separation between you and the outside atmosphere , the better .
it might make a sound .
there &apos;s a sort of myth that black holes devour everything in the universe , but you actually have to get very close to fall in .
the other puppet might like graham crackers .
and it &apos;s in this way that reason helps us create a better world .
for the past decade and a half or so , i &apos;ve been trying to figure out how these little dudes do what they do , and how they pull this magic trick off .
rather than bring nature into our laboratories and interrogate it there , we need to bring our science into the majestic laboratory that is nature , and there , with our modern technological armamentarium , interrogate every new form of life we find , and any new biological attribute that we may find .
so what are the five miracles needed for autonomous vehicles ?
one , you need to know where you are and exactly what time it is .
so lestrade needs his help , resents him , and sort of seethes with bitterness over the course of the mysteries .
jealousy likes the vast quantities of shiny hair , the cute little pencil case .
( music ) i &apos;d like to talk to you today a little bit about the work that my brother hays and i are doing — that &apos;s us there . that &apos;s both of us actually — specifically about a concept that we &apos;ve been developing over the last few years , this idea of location-aware music .
well , the same is true of the music , which my brother and i composed and mapped specifically for central park .
my father was assassinated .
and that &apos;s not fair .
the combined effect , the triangle ends up somewhere completely different .
but let &apos;s go back down to symmetries that i got for these two objects .
now , we ’ re about to publish the first study looking at the effects of this program on prostate cancer , and , in collaboration with sloane-kettering and with ucsf .
the other way is to change the type of food .
because there is something fundamental here that i think overrides the rest , and it is about our common humanity .
there was never an international investigation into what happened .
now don &apos;t get me wrong , working memory is awesome .
you ever forgotten your car ?
well , it turns out that you share that experience with more than three billion people every year .
the worst part is , when we take a look at some of the numbers , it &apos;s pretty scary .
and just to give you a sense of how this works , imagine that we took a nasal swab from every single one of you .
a hundred years from now , people may marvel that we were perhaps completely unaware of a new class of life that literally was right under our noses .
instead of wheels , a ballbot is balancing and moving on one single ball .
now to move and to balance , rezero needs to turn the ball .
and even as we do our own work , all too often , we find ourselves having to choose between doing what we think is the right thing and doing the expected thing , or the required thing , or the profitable thing .
we certainly can &apos;t trust the bankers , and we certainly can &apos;t trust the brokers .
i wanted to make more of these forests .
today , we are making forests in houses , in schools , even in factories with the corporates .
the most ardent of libertarians might argue that donoghue v. stevenson should have been thrown out of court and that stevenson would eventually have gone out of business if he &apos;d continued to sell ginger beer with snails in it .
it has to be possible to balance freedom of expression with wider moral and social responsibilities .
it &apos;s all over the web .
and when somebody is ready to purchase the product in their personalized design , they click &quot; &quot; enter &quot; &quot; and this data gets converted into the data that a 3d printer reads and gets passed to a 3d printer , perhaps on someone &apos;s desktop .
what an individual hacker or a small group of anonymous individuals did was enter those social media conversations that so many of us took part in .
or in another generation , some kid in his basement in estonia ?
( applause ) chris anderson : we &apos;re not quite done yet .
so , for those of you unfamiliar , twitter is based around a very simple , seemingly trivial concept .
because right now , we don &apos;t have any effective therapy or vaccine available .
and so , that &apos;s the clue .
so to just quickly conclude with some brief data that suggests this might be so .
and so there &apos;s over 120 million prescriptions out there for antidepressants .
but efficiency can be a cult , and today i &apos;d like to tell you about a journey that moved me out of the cult and back to a far richer reality .
how many of you have never used a mapping app for finding directions ?
but the remaining question was , how ?
it was just at the end of a regular day of work with the foundation .
they &apos;re not ideas , they &apos;re instincts .
and you could play with the rhythm .
but ultimately , i decided that what i really ought to do is not fight being who i am , but embrace it .
because archaeology gives us an opportunity to study past civilizations , and see where they succeeded and where they failed .
but nothing else does either .
i was thinking about my place in the universe , and about my first thought about what infinity might mean , when i was a child .
what is the business here ?
and if we wanted to zoom into a page , we can just open it up .
we just shot you . &quot; &quot; in fact , there are some like these : erskine bowles , alan simpson and others , who have gone through and given proposals for this overall federal health-spending state-level problem .
( laughter ) it &apos;s sort of the voters . it &apos;s sort of us showing up .
they can grow so big , blocking all daylight , making it very dark and ominous standing under them .
they become lovely monsters .
( laughter ) so , unfortunately or not surprisingly , most of the microbes they sell at the national academy building are pathogens .
and we can now start to compare the community of microbes and their genes and see if there are differences .
and last but not least , it is an obsession .
and in this case , a man got hooked on a bamboo sleeping mat .
you see , the scale of the suffering numbs us into a kind of indifference .
another three seconds , one more .
but this is really just the beginning .
in 1962 , buckminster fuller presented the particularly audacious proposal for the geoscope .
these are the people who i served with , and these are the people who i honor .
( applause )
you go places you &apos;ve dreamt about .
and i think when you &apos;re authentic , you end up following your heart , and you put yourself in places and situations and in conversations that you love and that you enjoy .
we don &apos;t feel , &quot; &quot; i am touching the air , &quot; &quot; but if the breeze is a little more faster , then i can feel it .
and context , what is really context ?
another political fear of human nature is that if we are blank slates , we can perfect mankind — the age-old dream of the perfectibility of our species through social engineering .
what a puzzle — i wonder why .
do you know that it takes years for a drug to go from an idea to being tested on cells in a laboratory , to animal studies , to then clinical trials on humans , finally to go through a regulatory approval process , to be available for your doctor to prescribe to you ?
in fact , it &apos;s hard .
ca : so your current proposition to consumers is , don &apos;t pay so much up front .
so we had a $ 100,000 sports car , which was the roadster .
so imagine if every video that we watched on the web worked like the web , completely remixable , linked to its source content , and interactive for everyone who views it .
popcorn changes all of that .
and if there &apos;s anything that has permeated this room , it is precisely that .
and when i did , i thought , well , i &apos;d better look this word up in the dictionary .
of course , there are the bases , which refer to specific sexual activities that happen in a very specific order , ultimately resulting in scoring a run or hitting a home run , which is usually having vaginal intercourse to the point of orgasm , at least for the guy .
so when do you play baseball ?
in the zaatari refugee camp in jordan , you can hear the shells across the border in syria at nighttime .
between 1922 and 1942 , these nansen passports were used as travel documents to allow 450,000 assyrians , turks and chechens to travel across europe and claim refugee status elsewhere in europe .
one researcher says that they probably sound a lot like the the voice of charlie brown &apos;s teacher in the old &quot; &quot; peanuts &quot; &quot; cartoon .
what looks like pathology to us may actually be a useful adaptation in some circumstances .
you had to have local control because there was no nationally-available information because travel was so restricted .
this was the pre-bureaucratic age , an age in which everything had to be local .
now we &apos;re learning about all these new molecular pathways — some of those could be repositioned or repurposed , or whatever word you want to use , for new applications , basically teaching old drugs new tricks .
one that has just happened in the last few months is the successful approval of a drug for cystic fibrosis .
so , humanity is our greatest invention .
if you search for the word &quot; &quot; technology , &quot; &quot; it was not used until 1952 .
these parts of the brain are quieting down .
it &apos;s the first part of climb .
genes send the instructions to make proteins .
this maps the large cabling in the brain .
the eyes do not tell us whether somebody &apos;s lying or not .
you weren &apos;t in a dead zone .
i want to give you a couple examples from my own work .
the golden rice was developed through support of the rockefeller foundation .
this is a bleached coral , coral that died during the 1982- &apos; 83 el nino .
and that alternates with a sediment that looks like this .
so if you look in the dictionaries and if you think about it , one very natural definition of religion is that it involves belief in gods or in spiritual beings .
it can &apos;t even be indifferent .
it will address transcendent qualities in the human consciousness , and sense of human need .
there may be a temptation to treat the biosphere holistically and the species that compose it as a great flux of entities hardly worth distinguishing one from the other .
thank you very much .
they wrote almost a thousand pages on the topic .
how many batteries do you carry for all the equipment that you have ?
that i &apos;m this uber-endurance guy ?
that &apos;s the wonderful richness of life .
we rush through life . we don &apos;t stop .
whenever there is an election , it seems like something always goes wrong , someone tries to cheat , or something goes accidentally awry — a ballot box goes missing here , chads are left hanging over here .
well , the way we &apos;ve come up with uses computers but doesn &apos;t depend on them .
i have occasional meetings with scientists .
so just keep looking . don &apos;t mind me .
give it up for that . ( applause ) halved . halved .
this fantastic news didn &apos;t happen by itself .
that way we do away with a few internet myths .
but that &apos;s about half the size of the biggest tuna we &apos;ve ever tagged .
it &apos;s often said that you can tell a lot about a person by looking at what &apos;s on their bookshelves .
time and again , people went out of their way to help me .
and if you look at this image , you can right away see clusters of happy and unhappy people , again , spreading to three degrees of separation .
i became obsessed with how it might be that we &apos;re embedded in these social networks , and how they affect our lives .
and whatever happens in this uniquely crucial century will resonate into the remote future and perhaps far beyond the earth , far beyond the earth as depicted here .
and perhaps the greatest living person is someone i &apos;m privileged to know , joe rothblatt .
what color is my shirt ? what color is my tie ?
great . double-check .
and then , the 92 nuclear power plants that it would take to provide the power would fill up the rest of los angeles .
and so every time a new medium arrives , the old medium is the content , and it is highly observable , highly noticeable , but the real , real roughing up and massaging is done by the new medium , and it is ignored .
and darwin kept these copious notebooks where he wrote down every little idea he had , every little hunch .
you would drink a little beer with breakfast and have a little wine at lunch , a little gin — particularly around 1650 — and top it off with a little beer and wine at the end of the day .
because of the problems with mycoplasma genitalium and its slow growth about a year and a half ago , we decided to synthesize the much larger chromosome , the mycoides chromosome , knowing that we had the biology worked out on that for transplantation .
and we knew , once that worked , that we actually had a chance if we could make the synthetic chromosomes to do the same with those .
we &apos;ve got the military — have just deployed some of these into iraq , where you can put fake troop movements quarter of a mile away on a hillside .
i &apos;ve got a coke can opening that &apos;s right in your head ; that &apos;s really cool .
lp : who &apos;s ted ?
dh : i &apos;ve got to prepare .
and in the depth of despair , in the midst of the movie , when it looks like he can &apos;t pull this thing off , and he needs this case , he needs to win this case so badly .
( laughter ) i find it &apos;s actually getting really hard to be serious .
sex . there &apos;s an awful lot of fast sex around , isn &apos;t there ?
so i was in new york recently , and i walked past a gym that had an advertisement in the window for a new course , a new evening course .
&quot; &quot; i don &apos;t understand . soybeans ?
it was a city so long ago that it was still called peking .
we &apos;re creating insurance , reducing the risk to our planet and to our economy , and at the same time , in the short term , we &apos;re not sacrificing performance .
i mean , come on , really ?
thank you .
i am so honored to be here with some of the world &apos;s top innovators and thinkers .
thank you .
the 200 years of whaling was clearly detrimental and caused a reduction in the populations of whales between 60 to 90 percent .
so the interesting thing about makers is that we create out of passion and curiosity , and we are not afraid to fail .
there was a time when we understood how things worked and how they were made , so we could build and repair them , or at the very least make informed decisions about what to buy .
video : this is the land .
so , &quot; &quot; i saw many trains and also rode on one .
is that something that you are still invested in , that you still believe in the notion of investment ?
the federal government has a lot on its plate , and state governments are going to have to step up .
and he gave the case out , both of them , to two groups of students .
the data shows this very clearly .
all of life is controlled by networks — from the intracellular through the multicellular through the ecosystem level .
the bigger you are , life gets faster .
they could enjoy all the benefits of the sunlight and have roots going down into the ocean ; life then could flourish much more .
so these creatures will be bright against the cold surroundings .
i think it &apos;s a hopeless goal . technologically , it &apos;s achievable ; economically , it &apos;s achievable ; politically , it means sort of the habits , institutions of people — it &apos;s impossible .
but now let &apos;s look at the other end .
( laughter ) but well done , him . ( laughter )
( laughter ) you can &apos;t see these things , but they are very strange . ( laughter )
so governments from russia to china to iran are actually hiring , training and paying bloggers in order to leave ideological comments and create a lot of ideological blog posts to comment on sensitive political issues . right ?
so you may wonder , why on earth are they doing it ?
yes , the girl falls , absurd to fall , even the earth with its compulsion to take unto itself all that falls must know that falling is absurd , yet the girl falling isn &apos;t myself , or she is myself , but a self i took of my own volition unto myself .
my mind teems , jumbles of faces , voices , impressions , i live my life over , as though i were drowning .
and their kids have an advantage .
you know why ? because they didn &apos;t care .
now that doesn &apos;t sound like a lot , but it &apos;s very important , because being able to deliver the transition as a light sport aircraft makes it simpler for us to certify it , but it also makes it much easier for you to learn how to fly it .
you &apos;re not powering the propeller , you &apos;re powering the wheels .
but as these conversations unfolded , i experienced what alice must have when she went down that rabbit hole and saw that door to a whole new world .
sure , you can say &quot; &quot; spatial and temporal , &quot; &quot; but why not just say &quot; &quot; space and time , &quot; &quot; which is so much more accessible to us ?
in writing a story , it is the place where i begin .
i have some ones that were long lasting : from the age of five to 15 , this was supposed to be my side occupation , and it led to a sense of failure .
and in 1989 , the way i remember it , i was in philadelphia visiting my girlfriend , and we decided , apropos of nothing , to go see this movie .
on my right was the girl in question .
you can do electronic pieces that fold and wrap .
and so what does that mean ?
thank you .
and you can actually simulate that behavior in the browser , which is what you see romo doing on the left .
so let me just make sure . hey , dr. batiuk . can you hear me okay ?
now , these people making these proclamations to me were not bad people .
and this is one of the most exciting projects that we &apos;re developing , which is a little character that &apos;s a spokesbot for friendly artificial intelligence , friendly machine intelligence .
and there is billions of dollars being spent on that .
in 2009 , we also identified that this new bubble , a smaller one , was unsustainable , so we published again a prediction , in advance , stating that by august 2009 , the market will correct , will not continue on this track .
scaling up the discussion at the size of the planet , we see the same thing .
he did not know each and every one of them , but with an admirable ingenuity , he managed to transform them into activists by giving them all the possibility to hold in their hands the arguments and the instruments that each would need to campaign in his name by making his own campaign .
the french e.u. official in charge of the funding rushed to block the painting .
this was at def con , the world &apos;s largest hacker conference .
it is even more true if we go after hackers that are willing to risk their own freedom for ideals like the freedom of the web , especially in times like this , like today even , as governments and corporates fight to control the internet .
and i &apos;m happy to sign it for you with any name of any artist .
if my room back home had looked like this , my mother would have grounded me for three days .
we &apos;re building a system that you &apos;ve always known how to use .
now ...
i believe that everyday soundscape can be the most unexpected inspiration for songwriting , and to look at this idea a little bit more closely , i &apos;m going to talk today about three things : nature , language and silence — or rather , the impossibility of true silence .
it was released as part of peter szöke &apos;s 1987 hungarian recording &quot; the unknown music of birds , &quot; where he records many birds and slows down their pitches to reveal what &apos;s underneath .
but that spring , there were new buds popping up from the earth .
my self-confidence can be measured out in teaspoons mixed into my poetry , and it still always tastes funny in my mouth .
whew ! it &apos;s a miracle i didn &apos;t make any mistakes on that song .
and i &apos;m going to play some songs for you tonight that are , literally , world premieres .
i &apos;ve actually chosen to take a different kind of risk .
and sometimes people ask me , &quot; well , what about an accident ? &quot;
the last thing i remember was lying on a white blanket , telling my surgeon that i needed to see my mother again , and to please try and save my voice .
i was sitting there kind of unenthusiastically talking with the head transplant surgeon , and i asked him if i needed a transplant , what i could do to prepare .
but help was coming .
but there were no maps , no maps of roads , no maps showing hospitals , no way for help to reach the cyclone victims .
it gets worse than that — or perhaps better than that .
and then the final step of this , once we perfect these technologies in animals and we start using them in human beings , what are the ethical guidelines that we will use then ?
coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind , and petroleum is cheaper than biofuels .
but there &apos;s no hope in the present political climate that we will see u.s. energy policy or international treaties that reflect that consensus .
no . no , right ?
( laughter ) but what we realized was that it &apos;s more than just money that &apos;s required .
hello .
it &apos;s about a few people loving you up close and about those people being enough .
it &apos;s kind of neat . ok .
rw : hmmm .
( audience : &quot; &quot; alpha house . &quot; &quot; ) yes , &quot; &quot; alpha house , &quot; &quot; but it seems like not too many of you here remember that show , actually , because it didn &apos;t turn out that great .
he wants to engineer success .
now we asked people to predict for us , to tell us how much money they would pay right now to see their current favorite musician perform in concert 10 years from now , and on average , people said they would pay 129 dollars for that ticket .
and it isn &apos;t just ephemeral things like values and personality .
one example of those is protein folding .
a few years ago , i got a call from a luxury fashion store called barneys new york , and the next thing i knew , i was designing storefront kinetic sculptures for their window displays .
i think single-cell organisms are possible within two years .
this is a cartoon of the structure of phi x 174 .
but , it &apos;s more complicated . it &apos;s not that simple , and you have to work with the people .
and that &apos;s green . if you look from the tower — this is when we start attacking the grass .
so , a few years ago , i &apos;m doing my transplant fellowship at stanford .
the hope is that this gets more stem cells out , which translates to better outcomes .
would you spend your remaining 20 dollars on a ticket ?
these are subjects coming to an experiment to be asked the simplest of all questions : how much will you enjoy eating potato chips one minute from now ?
so the first is , when you &apos;ve got one of these devices going , such as this contract to write everyday or pay , it &apos;s just a constant reminder that you have no self-control .
being up at the top means that you &apos;re enjoying a high income in retirement .
and we can evolve this exploration of the substance of things not seen . thank you .
this image here is created from a snippet of beethoven &apos;s ninth symphony playing through a cymatic device .
how do you describe that ?
each day , we are always saying , like , &quot; &quot; wow , i love you even more than 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; hi there , thanks for your email .
so on purchasing my item , i would send my bitcoin to a neutral , secure third digital wallet .
we might not ever know .
hs : wait , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait — let me see if i got this straight .
and that &apos;s exactly what the beetles are doing here .
it was that every now and then they &apos;d climb on top of the ball and they &apos;d take a look at the world around them .
this is why we give bonuses to bankers and pay in all kinds of ways .
and if you do all 12 steps , you care about the pin .
yes . it can , it does and it will , but for this book designer , page-turner , dog-eared place-holder , notes in the margins-taker , ink-sniffer , the story looks like this .
fourteen weeks on the best seller list , eight printings , and still going strong .
we &apos;re probably going to have to give them support , encouragement .
and just as in the spirit of first , gracious professionalism , they are quite proud of this , so they decide to share a drink .
we &apos;re very , very early . thank you very much .
this is the first vacuum cleaner , the 1905 skinner vacuum , from the hoover company . and this one weighed 92 pounds and took two people to operate and cost a quarter of a car .
this sounds immensely boring but games are able to make this process incredibly compelling .
it &apos;s associated with reward-seeking behavior .
&#91; &quot; &quot; &apos; fraud &apos; essays by david rakoff &quot; &quot; &#93; david rakoff was a wonderful writer and he called his first book &quot; &quot; fraud &quot; &quot; because he was getting sent on assignments by magazines to do things that he was not equipped to do .
so you &apos;ve got this mysterious title that really doesn &apos;t mean anything , so i was trying to think : where might i see a bit of mysterious text that seems to mean something but doesn &apos;t ?
his music never ceases to sound fresh and surprising to me .
i become the medium through which the music is being channeled , and in the process , when all is right , the music is transformed and so am i.
and what these cognitive biases do is they act as filters between us and reality .
nowadays , no kid will let you drive if you &apos;re not wearing a seat belt .
the damage comes in the form of a double-strand break through the double helix .
it calls its first responders .
as a bonus , she hooked me up with a second one they make .
and then i thought , &quot; &quot; good for him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pg &quot; &quot; is slavic literature .
i don &apos;t need to improve any more . &quot; &quot; reaching success , i was pretty good at coming up with good ideas .
i had fun again , i worked harder and , to cut a long story short , did all the things that took me back up to success .
now there &apos;s a solution to all these problems .
we haven &apos;t heard about why the buildings failed .
well , i was too .
but the key here is that it is not tagged as a parkinson &apos;s patient product .
they have epistemological modesty .
and when you synthesize it all , it &apos;s giving us a new view of human nature .
and so they played pretty good defense for us .
there was a time when i made them wear jackets and shirts and ties .
oh course , you might think , what &apos;s left without bolitics , sex and religion , how can you make people laugh ?
first , we &apos;d need to buy content from the west and air it .
right ?
right ?
he was a tinkerer and a statesman whose conception of citizenship was always predicated on action .
and so it &apos;s no surprise that many hackers are turning their attention to the problem of government .
we would then take that regeneration template and insert it into the missing meniscus cartilage to regrow that in a patient &apos;s knee .
so what about the next step ?
usually the killer is the brother or father or the uncle in the family .
the policies of a country do not necessarily always affect the tribal and rural communities .
the first fax machine — the person who bought the first fax machine was an idiot , because there was nobody to fax to .
if you want to have total personalization , you have to be totally transparent .
thank you very much .
and that was , &quot; &quot; what &apos;s the one piece of advice you would give to my girls ? &quot; &quot; and jeff &apos;s advice was , &quot; &quot; be a traveller , not a tourist .
the first few years of the web were pretty much video-free , for this reason : video files are huge ; the web couldn &apos;t handle them .
but on the web , all three dials are ratcheted right up .
it &apos;s open access ; you can all go in and download data as you wish .
now i realize for those of you who are colorblind , this slide is not very helpful , but stick with me nonetheless .
these are cell phones of the future .
i had very low , no particular expectations when they only came in one flavor .
you stand up , and you skim the stone .
he &apos;s just moved house . he &apos;s got no friends .
( applause )
urban poverty is even more concentrated , in these green little dots .
marco tempest : now tesla &apos;s brain worked in the most extraordinary way .
so let the story begin .
and then i &apos;m going to turn the lights out .
in fact , it &apos;s going to require twice the world &apos;s supply of oil to run the pumps to generate the water .
every one of those statements is wrong .
why have we got 130,000 troops on the ground ?
i &apos;ve been very surprised .
&quot; services cost too much for the poor . &quot;
fund the infrastructure . fund the schools .
but perhaps even more important , we heard before about the one percent , the 99 percent .
lots of you here will use smartphones to take photos and post them from the conference .
some of you might be wondering what a cybersecurity specialist looks like , and i thought i &apos;d give you a quick insight into my career so far .
but i know that we should be looking at the structure of the insurgency to answer that question .
these are different wars , with different religious factions , different political factions , and different socioeconomic problems .
i achieved access to the data , and today i &apos;m able to do physics at the level of the best astronomer , using sound .
these students will be learning radio astronomy , and they will be learning the sonification methods in order to study astronomical events like huge ejections of energy from the sun , known as coronal mass ejections .
i &apos;m afraid by what i see .
what was different this time is the way that the terrorists used modern information communications technologies to locate additional victims and slaughter them .
equally startling , from my point of view , is the fact that no one was drawing any connections between what is happening to the body politic , and what is happening in our leading educational institutions .
lest you think i exaggerate , here are the beginnings of the a-b-cs of anthropology .
it was only 5 , 6 , 7 years ago we couldn &apos;t even talk about the next chapter , because we were in the old chapter .
i want to leave this up here and come back to it .
but that doesn &apos;t make a lot of sense , does it ?
the csf fills the space that surrounds the brain , and wastes from inside the brain make their way out to the csf , which gets dumped , along with the waste , into the blood .
so what does this tell us ?
this week ? last week ?
and i would say the non-zero-sum dynamic is only going to grow more intense over time because of technological trends , but more intense in a kind of negative way .
and there &apos;s something i worry about especially , which is that this dynamic will lead to a kind of a feedback cycle that puts us on a slippery slope .
this may seem minor , but it is terrifying to hear rumor after rumor after rumor that another tidal wave , bigger than the last , will be coming at exactly 1 p.m. , or perhaps tonight , or perhaps ...
in about two minutes , it had reached the level of the railroad tracks and was coming over it . we had run about 100 meters by this time .
well , there &apos;s analog and digital . thought that was appropriate here .
and for the musicians .
this isn &apos;t an outlier .
if they believed there were any errors , we asked them to tell us what they were and we &apos;d go back and check and they never challenged any of our findings .
and nobody calls me nicky and nobody calls richard ricky , so nobody knew who she was talking about .
i &apos;ve been there , actually , many times .
( laughter ) rg : i &apos;m a very affectionate uncle , very affectionate uncle .
so after we had declan , we kind of recalibrated our expectations .
when you want less , it &apos;s because it &apos;s about work .
so , if you sort of compare that , like this , you &apos;ll see that computer versus human — i &apos;ve been tracking this for the last year — computer versus human over the last year has changed .
and my argument &#91; is &#93; that the only way for us to teach creativity is by teaching children perspectives at the earliest stage .
remember that children &apos;s book where you shake and the sexuality of the parents change ?
now , one of the characteristics of this change process is that information is always related to other inputs or information that is occurring in immediate time , in context .
we have the potential to move most of those children to the middle or to the right side .
my favorite warning was one on a five-inch fishing lure .
but it &apos;s a hard hurdle because we got into this legal quicksand because we woke up in the 1960s to all these really bad values : racism , gender discrimination , pollution — they were bad values . and we wanted to create a legal system where no one could have bad values anymore .
they take it for a little while , but when they try to leave , bang ! , the hammer comes down , and they discover they &apos;re enslaved .
i knew i had to do anything i could to earn some money to support the people i care about . &quot; &quot; they climb into the back of the truck . they go off with the person who recruits them .
men made these marks . women don &apos;t . &quot; &quot; now , i wasn &apos;t really surprised , because that &apos;s an attitude that i &apos;ve seen continuously all my life as a theater maker .
and unless i reeducate myself , i am always going to think that women &apos;s stories matter less than men &apos;s .
and those startups are focused on what they are , not what they &apos;re not , until one day athletepath , which is a website that focuses on services for extreme athletes , found this video .
and you say , &quot; &quot; hey , could you bring the skim milk ? &quot; &quot; and they walk out from behind the counter and they &apos;ve got no pants on .
you need a melt probe .
the ice could be anywhere from three to 16 miles deep .
in fact , if you go back in time , it is the norm that there are multiple species of hominids or of human ancestors that coexist at any one time .
we &apos;re one species out of approximately , or let &apos;s say , at least 16 upright-walking apes that have existed over the past six to eight million years .
we are shedding 10,000 years of our farming tradition and moving forward towards egalitarian relationships between the sexes — something i regard as highly compatible with the ancient human spirit .
even dating sites are not changing love .
bg : dambisa , thank you for coming to ted . dm : thank you very much .
in order to create sustainable , long-term economic growth and solve the challenges and social ills that continue to plague the world today , we &apos;re going to have to be more broad-minded about what might work .
he had visible tumors all over his body .
and then you &apos;ll be even more convinced you can &apos;t succeed .
can &apos;t do much with them : put them in your pocket .
that change in thinking has led to a dramatic shift , not only in the fortunes of monterey bay , but other places around the world .
and as i said earlier , china has not passed the united states .
china still has large areas of underdevelopment and per capita income is a better measure of the sophistication of the economy .
they &apos;re legal things .
and they &apos;re the masters .
so it &apos;s a really slow process , it &apos;s really expensive , and the outcome of that process , namely electronic circuit boards , are limited in all sorts of kind of interesting ways .
so they &apos;re really small , generally , they &apos;re square and flat and hard , and frankly , most of them just aren &apos;t very attractive , and so my team and i have been thinking of ways to really change and mix up the process and the outcome of designing electronics .
but this is not the europe we know today .
you now walk the same path as these early artists .
so as a result , we never throw anything out .
you know , you &apos;re not supposed to take long , warm showers .
and if you haven &apos;t noticed , 50 years is not what it used to be .
an asteroid impact ?
right now , our species is propagating an environmental disaster of geological proportions that is so broad and so severe , it can rightly be called the sixth extinction .
dragonflies with the wingspan of an eagle and pill bugs the length of a car really existed .
it &apos;s thousands of times , maybe 3,000 times tougher than this .
now , here &apos;s another little secret i &apos;m going to tell you about : for the last 25 years , oil has been playing less and less of a role in global energy systems .
and these heroes , they come from every walk of life , all sorts of backgrounds .
and in each of those , it was only part of the country .
so they believed that knowledge came from authorities that actually knew very little .
wondering , therefore , how to explain what they saw in terms of things unseen .
but if you give people vitamin d supplements , you don &apos;t change that high rate of heart disease .
and what we &apos;ve shown is that doing a sham irradiation — this is the thick line here — this is shining uv on the arm so it warms up but keeping it covered so the rays don &apos;t hit the skin .
there remains so much to explore .
i heard something , a low surge that got louder and louder as we came closer .
we &apos;re a ways away from improving people : our goal is just to make sure that we have a chance to survive long enough to maybe do that . thank you very much .
we &apos;re trying to get to the point of automation .
we know them as the &quot; &quot; make love , not war &quot; &quot; apes since they have frequent , promiscuous and bisexual sex to manage conflict and solve social issues .
for us and them , play is foundational for bonding relationships and fostering tolerance .
it &apos;s not harmful ; it has just repaired the muscle .
last summer i worked at stanford university , doing some research on cancer stem cells .
it demeans our language , actually , sometimes .
second , judging .
hundreds of verbs can go both ways .
( applause )
that may be the biggest , greatest gift that the movement has given us .
this turned out not to be true , but this idea of pervasive black homophobia set in , and was grabbed on by the media .
it can even lose three legs , in a tripod , and adopt a new gait , a hopping gait .
here &apos;s one moving with two middle legs gone .
and there &apos;s just about every element of the periodic table in seawater .
and what &apos;s more , this guy doesn &apos;t need a wire connected all the way back to a power station burning fossil fuels .
and how do you bring those two things together ?
the first thing we did was we took a little bicycle mirror and we band-aided it here , onto a gurney , a hospital trolley , so that when you were wheeled around by a nurse or by a doctor , you could actually have a conversation with them .
the lives of the elderly are widely recognized as constituting a disaster area of modern american society .
they &apos;ve already gained experience from raising their own children .
so in my lab , we &apos;re interested in the social brain , that is the network of brain regions that we use to understand other people and to interact with other people .
but now we try to understand that in terms of the development of a part of their brain called the limbic system , so i &apos;m going to show you the limbic system in red in the slide behind me , and also on this brain .
and that &apos;s what health leads has tried to do , to reclaim that real estate and that time and to use it as a gateway to connect patients to the resources they need to be healthy .
this aspiration that our healthcare keep us healthy is an enormously powerful one .
who should be coming up with this support ?
the prime minister of — ag : but , if i may , on these : i mean , what does a european see at home in a village where there are no migrants ?
it provides a surface for things in the ocean , and this surface , which is covered by seaweeds and other organisms in the ocean , will become enhanced marine habitat so it increases biodiversity .
we basically take waste water with algae of our choice in it , and we circulate it through this floating structure , this tubular , flexible plastic structure , and it circulates through this thing , and there &apos;s sunlight of course , it &apos;s at the surface , and the algae grow on the nutrients .
so she campaigned for cleaner , lighter , airier clinics to be designed and built .
he was yet another brilliant design visionary and design activist , who was completely committed to designing a sustainable society in such a forward-thinking way that he started talking about the importance of environmentalism in design in the 1920s .
i do not have that hat . i wish i had that hat .
you know , we have victorian design with an engine on it . that &apos;s all !
and so they get reborn as whatever , you know .
people laugh at me because , you know , i used to say that i used to meditate on mama cheney as my mom , when , of course , i was annoyed with him about all of his evil doings in iraq .
i found myself in a cell , handcuffed , blindfolded .
it helped a decentralized movement arise .
that gives you an idea of the different types of motivations and dedication .
this is looking at another event . this is called queen &apos;s day .
so having now a neanderthal genome on hand as a reference point and having the technologies to look at ancient remains and extract the dna , we can begin to apply them elsewhere in the world .
and to begin to answer such questions , my research group — since over 25 years now — works on methods to extract dna from remains of neanderthals and extinct animals that are tens of thousands of years old .
it &apos;s going to depend which part , say , of america they &apos;re in .
and we use gsi — geographic whatever it is , gsi — to determine the range of the chimps .
and if there is a supermassive black hole , what we need to assume is that it &apos;s a black hole on a diet .
now , most astronomers have a favorite star , and mine today is a star that &apos;s labeled up there , so-2 .
what exactly to the people watching this do every day ?
they need the leadership . it makes a difference .
and now what she &apos;s looking at in new york are colleges , because she &apos;s determined to go to school in new york .
because while we take the same photo , our perspectives change , and she reaches new milestones , and i get to see life through her eyes , and how she interacts with and sees everything .
there &apos;s actually almost no regulation in the uk around burial , and the little bit that there is , is about not polluting water courses , like not polluting rivers or groundwater .
so , i have an overlooked but potentially lucrative investment opportunity for you .
for decades , the prevalence estimates remained stable at just three or four children in 10,000 .
to make the case to the national health service that more resources were needed for autistic children and their families , lorna and her colleague judith gould decided to do something that should have been done 30 years earlier .
okay , so how is knowing this side of stress going to make you healthier ?
and unbeknownst to you , the experimenter has been trained to harass you during it .
there &apos;s still going to be no audio , but what i am going to do is i &apos;m going to render the sound visually in real time at the bottom of the screen .
so let &apos;s turn that off . we &apos;re indoors .
you &apos;ll have no choice ; you &apos;ll buy my code .
so i was a little depressed .
so if i was to walk outside in the rain wearing this dress today , i would immediately start to absorb huge amounts of water .
we could , for example , imagine growing a lamp , a chair , a car or maybe even a house .
1998 : a single mother of four , three months after the birth of my fourth child , i went to do a job as a research assistant .
the women &apos;s chief of the village has this little girl , fair color like me , totally dirty .
it turns out that the women that she gives readings for were all babylonian princesses , or something like that .
i have to explain that to you .
to me , this was unacceptable .
and there are high demands within an education system that is not perfect .
so what is rogue economics ?
it has happened with the fall of the roman empire .
however , i have to say , the process of communication does not come naturally to me .
and so i realized we had to go through the business of building an informed citizenry .
i &apos;ve spent more than three decades trying to get my head around quantum mechanics .
it &apos;s still speculative .
instead , what she really wanted to do was make films .
they were the co-authors of a book called &quot; &quot; manifesta . &quot; &quot; so what very profound epiphany , you might ask , was responsible for my feminist click moment ?
the good thing is that we are not powerless .
and there are times you should walk .
i work in some of the most extreme cave environments on the planet .
if i were to take a swab off your teeth and plate it on a petri plate , within about four or five hours , i would have to see growth .
and you &apos;re holding on with one hand , looking at the world turn beside you .
and if you &apos;re in canada , because of the cold winters here in b.c. , there &apos;s about 720 , 730 different types of spiders and there &apos;s one — one — that is venomous , and its venom isn &apos;t even fatal , it &apos;s just kind of like a nasty sting .
and so what better gift for a kid who wanted to be a chef than an easy-bake oven . right ?
i mean , we all had those when we were little .
again , the darkness of the body , now held within this bunker shape of the minimum position that a body needs to occupy , a crouching body .
it isn &apos;t some cultic thing . ( laughter ) it &apos;s just , it &apos;s just , i just would like us all to go there .
but what was it about this particular bump that caused thousands of physicists to collectively lose their cool ?
we will be forced to think in completely new ways .
i &apos;ve been beaten up more than 14 times in my life .
each of the girls that i have rescued — i have rescued more than 3,200 girls — each of them tell me one story in common ...
it &apos;s all lesser-evil terrain in these broken places .
it grew up in response to the atrocities in darfur .
and i get , over time , bored by them .
there is a fellow tedster who spoke two years ago , jonathan haidt , who defined his work into three different levels .
as we &apos;ll see in a moment , productivity is actually doing all right , but it has become decoupled from jobs , and the income of the typical worker is stagnating .
electricity is an example of a general purpose technology , like the steam engine before it .
let &apos;s find out .
i &apos;m going to ask you to raise your hand , whether you are liberal , left of center — on social issues , we &apos;re talking about , primarily — or conservative , and i &apos;ll give a third option , because i know there are a number of libertarians in the audience .
the pew institute , which produces good data on a regular basis on , for instance , in the states , says that — and i think that this number is conservative — 50 percent of anybody with email access at work is actually doing private email from his office .
i mean that what people are doing is , in fact , they are sort of , with their communication channels , they are breaking an imposed isolation that these institutions are imposing on them .
if you are surrounding yourself with the right people , they will not only get it , they will appreciate it .
exactly one week &apos;s worth of undies is all i put in my suitcase .
but don &apos;t throw away your phones yet .
how naturally your finger slides towards the buttons .
( laughter ) i &apos;ve always wanted to say that in this country . ( laughter )
( laughter ) now , those questions , which , of course , you &apos;ve got right , and you haven &apos;t been conferring , and so on .
if you can find a way to take the tribes that you &apos;re in and nudge them forward , along these tribal stages to what we call stage five , which is the top of the mountain .
now , what &apos;s important to people at zappos , these may not be the things that are important to you .
technology created by innovative companies will set us all free .
and what does that look like ?
for this , i had to expand upon my knowledge of coding with java and xcode and i also had to learn about how to code for bluetooth low energy devices by watching youtube tutorials and reading various textbooks .
when i laid out my plan , i realized that i faced three main challenges : first , creating a sensor ; second , designing a circuit ; and third , coding a smartphone app .
it was people from all around the world speaking in their native languages to be judged by five french strangers .
( applause ) according to five french strangers .
it &apos;s interesting . when people make a sound , when they laugh , when they fidget , when they take a drink or blow their nose or whatever , i hear everything .
i don &apos;t care to set a new precedent .
why were they swayed by one story so much more than the other ?
once in a while , our fears can predict the future .
one death every 20 seconds .
and the soy sauce results were inconclusive because of the large data range , but it seems like soy sauce actually increased the potential carcinogens .
so international actors should expand their funding and support for local conflict resolution .
and there are several other cases in which local , grassroots conflict resolution has made a crucial difference .
the pictures that came a bit later had a very simple reason .
solution : take human waste , take animal waste , put it into a chamber , out of that , extract biogas , methane gas .
they get interested in something .
this allows you to pay it forward by using this subject as a hook to science , because seti involves all kinds of science , obviously biology , obviously astronomy , but also geology , also chemistry , various scientific disciplines all can be presented in the guise of , &quot; we &apos;re looking for e.t. &quot;
one is that frito-lay figured out this liquidity thing with their consumer .
the first cultural value shift that we see is this tendency toward something we call liquid life .
when you pull the plug on a sink , it makes a vortex .
my personal favorite is nuclear energy .
and then another communication technology enabled new media : the printing press came along , and within decades , millions of people became literate .
evolution is speeding up .
so if it stopped working , i just had to take it off .
i &apos;m still using that old technology with a bicycle cable on his right side .
i &apos;ll always have a soft spot in my heart for this one .
so at this point , my curiosity grew .
in europe alone , all the male eu commissioners and the members of parliament of the swedish and iceland governments have signed up to be heforshe .
( laughter ) in fact , men don &apos;t care , we were told .
so if you look at the cell like that from the immune system , they &apos;re actually moving all over the place .
you have fragments of other shells . you have olivine .
a wonderful book , a mighty book , a mighty book that helped me understand and show you something quite remarkable .
it doesn &apos;t really make any sense as a number , right ?
( laughter ) in fact , all our processed foods contain more proteins than we would be aware of .
in fact , of all animals on earth , of all animal species , 80 percent walks on six legs .
and then they &apos;ve gone down to about 400 nesting pairs today .
so how do you make an apex predator , an ancient reptile , at once look like it dominates the system , but at the same time , look vulnerable ?
let &apos;s go to 40,000 years before the present , to the time of the cultural explosion , when music , art , technology , so many of the things that we &apos;re enjoying today , so many of the things that are being demonstrated at ted were born .
now let &apos;s advance to 10,000 years before the present .
they have been tasered to death .
they &apos;ve been killed talking on the cell phone , laughing with friends , sitting in a car reported as stolen and making a u-turn in front of the white house with an infant strapped in the backseat of the car .
and if they do that all at once , it &apos;s like playing poker and going all in right away .
unfortunately , we have our work cut out for us .
and i think that is incredible .
here &apos;s the real definition : doodling is really to make spontaneous marks to help yourself think .
okay , religious mania : there &apos;s rapture , there &apos;s weeping , there &apos;s visions .
t : i want to speak perfect english !
their breakthrough technology is synthetic biology .
i &apos;m really scared . i don &apos;t think we &apos;re going to make it .
if the dark energy remains around , the stars around us will use up their nuclear fuel , they will stop burning .
he said , well , entropy increases because there are many , many more ways for the universe to be high entropy , rather than low entropy .
i didn &apos;t have the framework .
please note that this is necrophilia .
they receive input from thousands of upstream partners and compute their own electrical outputs , which then , if they pass a certain threshold , will go to thousands of downstream partners .
and these are some of the cells that might be overactive in disorders such as epilepsy .
we organized ourselves to take a young man on a road trip across the united states .
here &apos;s a video about abstract mathematics .
they don &apos;t sing pop songs , they sing afghan music .
and you don &apos;t necessarily have to have your own tv set .
( applause ) so the final part of the puzzle is , how do you make all this work financially , especially when the people can &apos;t pay for it ?
and the second year went up to 75 percent .
three different sources said three different things about the bridge .
the allegations were that these guys were muslim brotherhood and they were throwing syrian army officers &apos; bodies off the bridge , and they were cursing and using blasphemous language , and there were lots of counterclaims about who they were , and whether or not they were what the video said it was .
i was born and raised in philadelphia , p.a , and this is not my home .
my name is dannielle hadley .
going forward , imagine a massively parallel version of this with thousands of pieces of human tissue .
by combining tissue engineering techniques with microfluidics , the field is actually evolving towards just that , a model of the entire ecosystem of the body , complete with multiple organ systems to be able to test how a drug you might take for your blood pressure might affect your liver or an antidepressant might affect your heart .
and even more interesting than that is that recent discoveries are telling us that insects and other little animals with smaller brains can use medication too .
they only eat milkweed as larvae .
but that &apos;s fine with me , because it sorts the wheat from the chaff , and i can find which people are genuine and true and i can pick these people as my friends .
people often associate autism with liking maths and science and nothing else , but i know so many autistic people who love being creative .
and there &apos;s a cause for that , all right .
and what we do is we grow extracellular matrix from pigs .
big kids love strawberries and bananas .
so i called george irwin , and what do you know ?
humans made this air , but it &apos;s also the most potent greenhouse gas that has ever been tested .
actually , why don &apos;t we all right now together take one big , collective , deep breath in .
this is a wonderful thing .
and all of these things to me give such joy and excitement and wonder .
many rich nations also have a blanket ban on sending money to specific countries .
to send money within africa , the cost is even higher : over 20 percent .
( laughter ) it had arrived and so , too , perhaps has a new era for journalism .
these alleged members of a mexican drug cartel were arrested after we published details about their hideout .
but it only increased from 0.6 of one percent to 0.8 of one percent of the ocean protected , globally .
millions of tons of discarded fishing nets , gear that continues to kill .
tr : thanks so much . max little , everybody .
ml : absolutely .
so , i think that the only true disability is a crushed spirit , a spirit that &apos;s been crushed doesn &apos;t have hope , it doesn &apos;t see beauty , it no longer has our natural , childlike curiosity and our innate ability to imagine .
there is adversity and challenge in life , and it &apos;s all very real and relative to every single person , but the question isn &apos;t whether or not you &apos;re going to meet adversity , but how you &apos;re going to meet it .
it &apos;s in perspective and everything .
this owner has a pet peeve about bad automobile entries .
these little insects , it &apos;s the same ones we see out here &#91; in india &#93; , two inches long , five centimeters long , flying in their millions , 400 miles across the ocean , at 2,000 meters up . quite incredible .
in bangalore , a colleague there sent me information for three years , average , 24th of september , so late september .
her first marriage did not survive , nor did her second marriage .
it &apos;s a hurtful thing .
( applause ) this baby is fully electric .
fn : and i also had an interest in dangerous inventions .
( applause )
small roundabouts are starting to appear .
we need the natural world . we cannot go on destroying it at the rate we are .
they were interested in health ; they were interested in education .
curitiba , my city : three million in the metropolitan area , 1,800,000 people in the city itself .
this is the main pedestrian mall ; we did it in 72 hours . yes , you have to be fast .
so it &apos;s conceivable , if god were to exist , he might wonder , i &apos;m eternal , i &apos;m all-powerful , but where did i come from ?
god made it .
you can go ahead and play .
but let &apos;s see what the baby does .
we all know that exploration is risky .
the same goes for companies .
this really touched me .
sirna are short sequences of genetic code that guide a cell to block a certain gene .
do they think , do they feel and , if so , how ?
( applause )
this thrust my mother , my sister and i out of the relative comfort of middle-class life and into the almost constant struggle to make ends meet .
i was ostracized by many of my classmates , one of whom went so far as to invite me to &quot; &quot; do what i really came here to do &quot; &quot; as he pushed all the dirty dishes from our meal in front of me to clean up .
( applause ) ( laughter ) and you correct me if i &apos;m wrong .
somebody who &apos;s working for you , or a partner , or even yourself .
just think of people at a checkout line or at a red light .
i &apos;m back here on the ted stage again .
for example , when i &apos;m psychotic i often have the delusion that i &apos;ve killed hundreds of thousands of people with my thoughts .
imagine having a nightmare while you &apos;re awake .
mycorrhiza was used in one field but not in the other .
several of these nutrients are essential chemical elements : phosphorus , nitrogen and calcium .
people going , &quot; &quot; awesome wheels , dude ! those are awesome !
the song is just a given , that &apos;s how you have to think about it .
i &apos;m not telling a story , i &apos;m making a case .
( laughter ) thank you .
so what this is , is a kind of a sketch , an application sketch i wrote in python . you know how there &apos;s photoshop ?
so art makes questions , and leadership is something that is asking a lot of questions .
nobody can keep that straight in their head .
so where are we going to get this information ?
god , the one who rules the entire universe , wants my bread ? &quot; &quot; he rushes to the synagogue . &quot; &quot; i &apos;ll get it out of the ark before anybody finds it . &quot; &quot; he goes in there , and it &apos;s not there .
and , as many people do , he was dozing off during the sermon .
thank you .
each time i click it , car turn .
i know dr. carolyn porco is the camera p.i.
this software allows us to come close and look at parts of this .
were there things that weren &apos;t being done ?
it &apos;s allowed us to increase our ambition in what the foundation can do quite dramatically .
the soviet union collapsed , iraq was defeated , and a new environment was created in the region in which both of them felt more secure , but they were also now left unchecked .
in spite of the very clear anti-israeli ideology of the new regime , the geopolitical logic for their collaboration lived on , because they still had common threats .
it &apos;s just how big are they , how close are they to each other , how are they interspersed together and do you have a street network , rather than a cul-de-sac or a collector system of streets ?
so find those places where you have most of them and fix what you can , fix what still needs fixing in those places .
but when you &apos;re sharing a car and you have a car-share service , you might use an e.v. to commute , you get a truck because you &apos;re doing a home project .
what percentage of the time ?
we have used our brains to fashion ever more amazing technologies .
and i &apos;m grateful for the opportunity to share this voyage with you today .
so for a fun twist , let us imagine that the only source of water available is trapped as frozen blocks miles below the surface .
the field of study that has enabled us to utilize the capabilities of the microbe is known as synthetic biology .
( applause )
also , the trait spreads only with each successive generation .
i became very interested , and i wrote about a couple .
but that &apos;s just a very small facet of a much greater problem of invasions of species worldwide , all through the ecosystems , and you know , the earth itself — ca : partly caused by us , inadvertently .
most remote community , i have never met a villager who does not want a vote .
that can mean different things in different countries .
it was like manna from heaven .
but we need to be very clear about how little that means .
tell her the truth . make it your life .
your daughter , for whom you have already carried so much , wants to know what you brought , what gift , what light did you keep from extinction ?
still ...
but this really only works during the daytime .
this is a huge challenge for us to do that .
so transforming the data set into something that looks like this .
( applause ) we call ourselves the sleepy man banjo boys .
tommy mizzone : tonight we &apos;re going to play you two songs .
can i ? would you ? what is your name ? gwen .
so ladies and gentlemen , how is this possible ?
and think of what that would do for you .
it &apos;s a resonant phenomenon for which he actually received a macarthur fellowship award , which is nicknamed the genius award , last september , for his discovery .
and she said , &quot; &quot; ok , then , &quot; &quot; and walked away .
you got to choose the three famous writers you wanted to meet , and these guys went and found them for you .
it gives us a way of reaching out to audiences around the globe , but nothing replaces the authenticity of the object presented with passionate scholarship .
tapestries were ubiquitous between the middle ages and , really , well into the 18th century , and it was pretty apparent why .
so she created a support group for parents like her .
i am the exception .
she &apos;s the co-creator of my 200-year plan .
i can actually visualize my future approaching .
speak up . speak out . be a good person .
it makes it worse , the fire spreads .
it turns out , the evidence says otherwise .
in recent years , researchers have been studying what happens when we give poor people cash .
it &apos;s been blessed . &quot; &quot; that was their perception .
so we said , &quot; &quot; let &apos;s do it . &quot; &quot; the women said , &quot; &quot; we agree . we &apos;ll use pills , but we need a doctor to prescribe the pills , &quot; &quot; and we had very , very few doctors .

five students can be educated at aims for the cost of educating one in the u.s. or europe .
we would be thrilled if we had one semitone pitch perception in cochlear implant users .

this is a golden coral , a bush .
we basically have a chat room going on here , because once it gets started , everybody &apos;s talking .

in another experiment , we presented to our subjects information about a potential job candidate .
now you may be thinking , this does not apply to me , because i have nothing to hide .
this is jonas .
in fact , i believe , given more knowledge of the complex evolutionary processes that drive cancer &apos;s growth , we can defeat cancer .
maybe he ate something bad for lunch , and then things get really horrible , as his skin rips apart , and he sees a virus coming out from his insides .
instead , it silently slips into the bacteria &apos;s own dna , and it just stays there like a terrorist sleeper cell , waiting for instructions .
go get some of that . and i learned that at a young age .
and then i had all the good ones that didn &apos;t look crappy . they were 50 cents each .
what am i appealing to you to step forward and drive ?
that &apos;s headed up to about nine billion .
politicians in a big , complex , sophisticated i.t. project ?
that &apos;s what a lot of people said about turbo trading in financial exchanges 20 years ago .
now , luckily , this thrinaxodon , the size of a robin egg here : this is a skull i &apos;ve discovered just before taking this picture — there &apos;s a pen for scale ; it &apos;s really tiny — this is in the lower triassic , after the mass extinction has finished .
they stop complex life from existing .
thank you .
that is , he did none of the things that might make it easy to cry foul , to put down the whole story as a pious fable .
as we heard earlier , movement is very important in these kinds of living systems .
so we came up with a different protocell model , and this is actually simpler than the previous one .

and i was looking around and i found this wonderful picture .
the power of spectroscopy was actually realized by pink floyd already in 1973 .
a hot gas is producing emission lines only , no continuum .
the audience is led to make assumptions or elaborations that are perfectly reasonable , but do not , in fact , match what is being done in front of them .
they are live and reacting to me in real time .
they put up a plaque to commemorate what happened there .
thank you .
( laughter ) and when i went out to meet the press , they zeroed in , said , &quot; &quot; why are you wearing that snake pin ? &quot; &quot; i said , &quot; &quot; because saddam hussein compared me to an unparalleled serpent . &quot; &quot; and then i thought , well this is fun .
ma : well the interesting part was i was asked what it was like to be the first woman secretary of state a few minutes after i &apos;d been named .
i &apos;ll figure something out .
quite consciously , design projects that need an incredible amount of various techniques , just basically to fight straightforward adaptation .
of course , here you don &apos;t feel the cold , or the heat — you just see the possibilities .
how do you create the sense of transcendence , the sense of evoking a perfect world ?
and it shows the first time an organ was ever transplanted .
this is actually showing a piece of muscle and how we go through the structures to actually engineer the muscle .
plastics take hundreds to thousands of years to biodegrade .
this means that our bacteria were actually living off of phthalates .
so i did what instinctively felt like the right thing , which was to go onto the internet and try to figure out if i could take matters into my own hands .
the factory was in the designer , and the designer was literally in the factory .
they had taken baths hundreds of times because it was unthinkable for them to do .
i could recall that they had used the best of their clothes .

toothbrush , cool .
my grandfather was a cobbler .
anybody ?
our economy was based on commodities , so the price of cotton or the price of wheat , and ultimately the price of oil and natural gas .

it &apos;s the home of my mentor .
so in closing i would offer you this : the planet is our canoe , and we are the voyagers .
if you go on the ted website , you can currently find there over a full week of tedtalk videos , over 1.3 million words of transcripts and millions of user ratings .
slides are okay , though you might consider going for props .
this is one-way traffic .
and if you were to just poke a hole over here and put a third matchstick , you &apos;ll get a t joint .
we found that after they adopted it the complication rates fell 35 percent .
now a system , however , when things start to come together , you realize it has certain skills for acting and looking that way .
and one of my favorites is the itoki fluctus , who is the nicaraguan goddess of insects , stars , and planets .
i don &apos;t know . but it &apos;s investigative material , no doubt .
it &apos;s the ideas .
it &apos;s our generation that is witnessing the end of western predominance .
so you go , even in the exhibition , from the idea of nanotechnology and the nanoscale to the manipulation of really great amounts of data — the mapping and tagging of the universe and of the world .
this is quite beautiful . it &apos;s dunne and raby , &quot; &quot; all the robots . &quot; &quot; those are a series of robots that are meant to be taken care of .
so that &apos;s a pretty bad prediction .

so he says to ryan , &quot; &quot; how often have you been smoking ? have you been drinking ?
but the simple act of encouraging her to come along to that first event led to a process where natural friendships formed , friendships that today are replacing the need for expensive services .
you can go one step beyond and actually create a simulation system , create a mediterranean simulator which is capable actually of reconstructing even the information we are missing , which would enable us to have questions you could ask like if you were using a route planner .
this is what i call the information mushroom .
perhaps by then we will be able to afford the luxury of just sitting in an audience with no other purpose than to witness the human form in motion .
first you trap atoms in a special bottle .
for example , we did books — not for sale — that all the community would get .
people say , &quot; &quot; oh , why don &apos;t you go in iraq or afghanistan .
so this is the foundations of what ’ s called , traditionally , liberal political theory and newtonian physics .
in fact , newton and locke were friends .
and here &apos;s the problem .
and when people aren &apos;t allowed to be useful , they soon think that they &apos;re useless .
obrigado . thank you .
if the protests that swept brazil in june 2013 have taught us anything , it &apos;s that every time we try to exercise our power outside of an electoral context , we are beaten up , humiliated or arrested .

in particular , she &apos;s worried about what happens after her 10-day stay on bed rest at the hospital .
rather than just making them work with adhesives , let &apos;s integrate them into adhesives , and that could solve our manufacturing problem . &quot; &quot; this picture that you see here is our ability to embed these censors inside of a piece of scotch tape by simply peeling it off of a wafer .
you &apos;re giving up on 300 years of human progress and human hope and all the rest of it .
but we have this persistent confusion between objectivity and subjectivity as features of reality and objectivity and subjectivity as features of claims .
one of the things that characterizes extroverts is they need stimulation .

the day the war was over , i remember seeing this image — one of blocked roads , of displaced people eagerly rushing south , back to their homes , regardless of what they would find .
i once had this nightmare : i &apos;m standing in the middle of a deserted field full of land mines .
and imagine if , through new scientific advances , we were just beginning to understand its importance to how we think of ourselves .
we haven &apos;t demonstrated this in humans yet but maybe it &apos;s just a matter of time before we find out . ( laughter ) so microbes are performing a huge range of functions .
so essentially , the shape of the building that you &apos;re born into is the shape of the structure which carries you to your ancestral resting place .
and this ceremony has to take place in front of the eyes of the whole community with everyone &apos;s participation .
how much room is that ?
i read a calculation at one point , i think google has a drive failure about every minute or two , and they just throw out the hard drive and swap in a new one .
and only then , as time went on , they began to recognize that they were the creators , the owners of these inner voices .
we may all have different opinions about this .
all of us wore pink boas for the occasion , and crystal , as you can see , queen for a day , wore a sparkly tiara .
this is cassie , a therapy camel visiting one of our young patients in her room , which is pretty magical .
( applause ) so , to get quickly to my first wish — the brain operates by electrical signals .

data : a couple of new jersey hunters are out in the woods .
he says , &quot; &quot; i feel bad about the polar bears .
how do we imagine animals , how do we think and feel about them , and how do their reputations get written and then rewritten in our minds ?
and doing on titan what rain does on the earth : it carves gullies ; it forms rivers and cataracts ; it can create canyons ; it can pool in large basins and craters .
and they converge into this channel here , which drains into this region .
the vast majority of those are on women under the age of 21 .

and i try to figure out how that works .
audience : apple . kenneth cukier : apple . of course it is .
arthur samuel knew strategy .
i wish for us to discover the millions of unknown archaeological sites around the world .

( applause ) and it costs the same as a normal syringe .
that &apos;s where the biggest benefit is .
so our group &apos;s role and our group &apos;s mission is to innovate by employing carbon nanotubes , because we think that they can provide a path to continue this pace .
&quot; &quot; the sleepy giant , &quot; &quot; which is the song that i just sang , is one of his poems .
i became very curious about the poets after spending six years with them , and started to research their lives , and then decided to write a book about it .
but just imagine it &apos;s a really random jumble of letters .
these people believe that the indus script represents an ancient form of the dravidian language family , which is the language family spoken in much of south india today .

they listen to his metaphors and analogies , and they start learning these little things that if they practice enough becomes the key to magic .
and third , through intense reflection , he gathered the information that he needed to design and revise the procedure , and then , with a steady hand , he saved my life .
( explosion ) all right , all right .
it got even more exciting when he then wrote down these two large prime numbers in your standard multiplication format — and for the rest of the hour of his talk frank nelson cole busted that out .
he proved it was prime with nothing more than a quill , ink , paper and his mind .
so there is a group in los angeles called the independent investigations group , or the iig , and they do great work .

on october 7 , he calls his cousin in belgium , and explains his situation .
in virtually every case of corruption that we &apos;ve investigated , shell companies have appeared , and sometimes it &apos;s been impossible to find out who is really involved in the deal .

if you know anything about the history of computers , you will know that in the &apos; 30s and the &apos; 40s , simple computers were created that started the computer revolution we have today , and you would be correct , except for you &apos;d have the wrong century .
one was the scanning of babbage &apos;s archive .
we know that 80 percent of life &apos;s most defining moments take place by age 35 .
that new piece of capital , that new person to date almost always comes from outside the inner circle .
so the more you step back , embrace complexity , the better chance you have of finding simple answers , and it &apos;s often different than the simple answer that you started with .
most are non-violent and they fall into two broad categories : active engagement with ethnic rivalries and religious beliefs and fair , transparent economic development and provisioning of services .
i began to reshape my destiny .
i felt worthless .
everyone was very excited about this archaeological find , because it meant that they might finally be able to assemble a single dodo skeleton .
but in this case , it &apos;s not about the author , it &apos;s not about the book or the movie or the story , it &apos;s about the object in and of itself .
well , he makes a mess .
this was the most exciting day of vera &apos;s life .
what is that made of , and how much does it cost ?
we then make that a video game to give patients simple , motivating objectives to follow .
they do great things for a few people who suffer from some specific condition , but for most people , they don &apos;t really transform what it is to be human .

rs : should ivan get in trouble for taking joshua &apos;s sandwich ?
since we know people want to be happy , maybe when our minds wander , they &apos;re going to someplace happier than the place that they &apos;re leaving . it would make a lot of sense .

we collect a bunch of biological information in this artificial setting , and we fix them up , like humpty-dumpty all over again , and send them home , and hope — we might hand them a brochure , maybe an interactive website — that they do as asked and don &apos;t come back into the mainframe .
so , sensors are looking at that kind of voice .
nobody would want to go through something like that . &quot; &quot; and yet , when i talk to whistleblowers , the recurrent tone that i hear is pride .

a different book was written not too long ago in the mid-90s called &quot; &quot; touched with fire &quot; &quot; by kay redfield jamison in which it was looked at in a creative sense in which mozart and beethoven and van gogh all have this manic depression that they were suffering with .
i could either deny my mental illness or embrace my mental skillness .
it &apos;s happening !
when you have nanotechnology and nanoscience , what &apos;s occurred is that we &apos;re able to now look at atoms and molecules and actually control them for great benefits .
then we can actually see that what started out as just straight lines is actually a curve called a parabola .
i like to say that this is the image of four-thirds .
it was true just recently of ebola .
new york city &apos;s not exceptional .

some recent discoveries : there &apos;s an ant colony from argentina that has now spread to every continent but antarctica ; there &apos;s a self-directed robot scientist that &apos;s made a discovery — soon , science may no longer need us , and life may no longer need us either ; a microbe wakes up after 120,000 years .
it was a summer day in 1941 .
next , he watched his wife go into labor at his hospital .

our poetry is our mutation , our life .
we can do it essentially with other videos as well .
( applause ) i call it the visual microphone .
and what it really says , and what you want to estimate , is the probability of different beliefs given your sensory input .
so we can bring the experiments of the 21st century by applying robotic technologies to this problem .
obviously not , right ? that would be irresponsible .
i think it &apos;s time to upgrade the system .
yet 99 percent of trades on swaptree happen successfully , and the one percent that receive a negative rating , it &apos;s for relatively minor reasons , like the item didn &apos;t arrive on time .

why this might be the case ?
this is an anecdote from his travels in south america .
and then you need to add some more ports , and more .
and how would that change the experience for the patient ?
they want to respond . they want to say the same thing .
and the client was saying , no , it &apos;s 10,000 a day .
take it out of this room .
and the observations that he made on that epic journey were to be eventually distilled into his wonderful book , &quot; &quot; on the origin of species , &quot; &quot; published 150 years ago .
ultimately , my hope is that the beauty and purpose of this microscopic universe can inspire new and creative approaches for the future of cancer research .
thank you .
&quot; worrying solves nothing . &quot;
singapore was quite in discussion .
this is a three-year-old orphan girl who had cataracts .
that &apos;s my son , darius .
and the first project is something we did a couple of years ago in zaragoza , spain .
and that &apos;s the beauty of doing things that are used and interact with people .
there &apos;s a man out there , somewhere , who looks a little bit like the actor idris elba , or at least he did 20 years ago .
and why is that ?
so , here we are , mission . big trouble .
so that &apos;s not new . what we &apos;re doing is applying this technology to it .
she was about the same age as my mother .
i have loans and mortgages .
it &apos;s very easy to pick up a stainless-steel bottle or a glass bottle , if you &apos;re traveling and you &apos;ve forgotten to bring your stainless-steel bottle and fill that up with water or filtered water , versus purchasing plastic bottled water .
so i came together with a group of other people who were all looking at this issue , and we created the plastic pollution coalition .
what &apos;s interesting about high falls is that although we use airbags , and some airbags are quite advanced , they &apos;re designed so you don &apos;t slip off the side like you used to , if you land a bit wrong . so , they &apos;re a much safer proposition .
the next thing that i &apos;d like to show you is something that dunlop asked me to do earlier this year with our channel five &apos;s &quot; &quot; fifth gear show . &quot; &quot; a loop-the-loop , biggest in the world .
why talk about social-economic movements that may be more than a century away ?
and instead , they &apos;ll be planning for the future and starting to build the 22nd century enlightenment .
so the experience of humanity has always been that there are some shapes which have this peculiar property , that each part is like the whole , but smaller .
i was very much involved in it , but then turned my attention to other phenomena .
north korea is a gulag posing as a nation .
they had never heard of mark zuckerberg or steve jobs .
the first point was the importance of rules , like those rules that say you can &apos;t come in and disturb all the existing apartment holders .
the other place that &apos;s very interested in city building is singapore .
i live in beijing . every day , i just watch the american embassy &apos;s data to decide whether i should open my window .
and now , today i want to tell you my personal observation in the past several years , from that wall .
sticks ? david only has one stick .
so david &apos;s coming down the mountain , and he &apos;s clearly not preparing for hand-to-hand combat .
bear in mind this was an ultrasound , so it would have been moving images .
this one said , &quot; &quot; yield : one ejaculate . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) there &apos;s another way that orgasm might boost fertility .
it rained a lot in one country , it didn &apos;t rain quite as much in the other .
it began with one question : if africa was a bar , what would your country be drinking or doing ?
first , let me take a famous philosopher who wrote about those questions of justice and morality , give you a very short lecture on aristotle of ancient athens , aristotle &apos;s theory of justice , and then have a discussion here to see whether aristotle &apos;s ideas actually inform the way we think and argue about questions today .
here &apos;s how he put it .
the room we happen to be in , the amplification , the quality of the instrument , the type of sticks ... etc . , etc .
in a year &apos;s time , it could be two extra steps .
i was born on a farm , a farm that was more than 50 percent rainforest &#91; still &#93; .
i went to see a friend &apos;s doctor in paris , told him that i was completely sick .
you can &apos;t hack it .
thank you .
so they &apos;re called &quot; &quot; pictures of chocolate . &quot; &quot; freud probably could explain chocolate better than i. he was the first subject .
that led me to another step of why i &apos;m here today , is because i really liked media of all kinds .
it impacts everything .
and then , towards the bottom , you see the failure to appear score , which again is the likelihood that someone will come back to court .
can you ? do you jam ? do you have anything else ?
pr : we haven &apos;t prepared anything .
you &apos;ll see the petals unfurl .
we build a big screen , we fly it in space , we put it up in front of the star , we block out most of the light , we fly a space telescope in that shadow that &apos;s created , and boom , we get to see planets .
we &apos;ve met thousands , possibly millions of people , who want the opportunity to invest in social change .
do you want to also help government find whether there &apos;s a better economic model , not just leaving these guys to come out of prison and waiting till they re-offend and putting them back in again , but actually working with them to move to a different path to end up with fewer crimes and fewer victims ?
joe kowan : i have stage fright .
next your non-essential systems start to shut down , like digestion . ( laughter ) so your mouth gets dry , and blood is routed away from your extremities , so your fingers don &apos;t work anymore .
the god theory is not just a bad theory .
&quot; &quot; no , i don &apos;t know that atheists should be considered citizens , nor should they be considered patriots .
that promise is already in jeopardy .
let &apos;s take a brief reminder of what those tools looked like .
when i was just about to give everything up after years of suffering , i started to rediscover the true power of music .
but it &apos;s now your turn .
i had the question popped into my head : what does the cone that connects the sun and the earth look like if you could connect the two spheres ?
so the evolution of this — i gather this isn &apos;t your first pendulum .
the women made their own decisions at the end of the day as to how they would use this access to credit to build their little businesses , earn more income so they could take care of their families better .
and the good news was that the institution , the banking institution , lasted .
good morning .
we were not going to leave until the peace accord was signed . &quot; &quot; and the peace accord was signed .
you cannot buy a ticket commercially to fly into space in america — can &apos;t do it . you can buy it in russia .
i &apos;m particularly troubled that what nasa &apos;s doing right now with this new bush doctrine to — for this next decade and a half — oh shoot , i screwed up .
here are the ones that have been cancelled in the last few years with some green alternatives proposed .
at the other end of the planet , antarctica the largest mass of ice on the planet .
now , this idea of changing , of creating a perceptual shift , as it were , came home to me to roost in a very personal manner about 10 years ago .
what if the organ needed to have memory ?
we &apos;ll see the same thing in the economic recession we &apos;re having now .
when we walked through the savanna a thousand years ago we made linear predictions where that animal would be , and that worked fine . it &apos;s hardwired in our brains .
now , let me introduce you to frank .
next day , one of my nurses smuggled in a snowball for me .
whereas how do we stay ahead of the bacteria ?
we don &apos;t want to just throw money at a problem .
although , listening to kevin kelly , you don &apos;t have to remember anything .
i would wager that their iq is exactly the same as the average evolutionist .
and then they can also , when you snap , line up exactly the way you &apos;d like to .
we toured that for a long time . it is now permanently in vienna , where we built a museum around it .
how does an individual spider make so many kinds of silk ?
what silk biologists do is we try to relate these sequences , these amino acid sequences , to the mechanical properties of the silk fibers .
if you do this , the common , the logic says you must turn the wrist .
the new chaos theory is already old , right ?
and they &apos;re always wrong , always hilariously , optimistically wrong .
this is pitched into the future from 1946 , looking at the day all american families have them .
and as many of you know , this virus went undetected , it evaded detection for three or four months when it began .
we are not allowed to wash the bodies to bury them the way our communities and our rituals demand .
very expensive to do , so there is not a lot of competition .
i &apos;m going to vote for this bill . &quot; &quot; and many of his own supporters on his own site went very publicly berserk .
and there he was .
it &apos;s such an extraordinarily artificial color .
it &apos;s about 30 degrees outside .
( laughter ) and as you &apos;ll see now , i &apos;m not wearing pants . ( laughter )
for 12 years , i have produced collaborative portraits , still lifes , landscapes and aerial views in order to build a visual archive to address the intersection of the steel industry , the environment , and the health care system &apos;s impact on the bodies of my family and community .
in 2013 , i chartered a helicopter with my cameras to document this aggressive dispossession .
if you &apos;re a conservative , be the conservative who is always going on about poverty and the moral obligation to be a warrior for the poor .
wrong .
it went right into my heart .
i don &apos;t like to bring up embarrassing secrets to an international audience , but i have to .
and so doctors and nurses — they look up to them as experts .
now the groups , it &apos;s not like me lecturing , but what happens is women , they come together — under the support and guidance of our mentor mothers — they come together , and they share their personal experiences .
and what will you be able to do with that sample ?
i &apos;d actually like to get it into more of a metro hub , like grand central or penn station , right next to some of the other , actual vending machines in that location .
and in fact this is probably why mostly men , boys , are psychopathic killers , or are very aggressive .
so we &apos;re interested in exactly where in the brain , and what &apos;s the most important part of the brain .
so at the time , it was my opportunity to put a call out to innovators outside the traditional medical prosthetic community to come bring their talent to the science and to the art of building legs .
interesting .
it ’ s already flattening out .
but hey , you ’ re listening to me .
but these two people worked something out .
all of a sudden i passed the national examination , found myself in a very beautiful high school in kenya .
and we &apos;ll begin to be able to do as cody does , and actually be in touch with these incredible models , these elders that have been here far , far longer than we have .
turns out that — this is a galapagos shark .
we found that that was so exciting for folk , and people were so responsive to the work , that we had to then find bigger buildings .
jc : that makes so much sense . one more question : you make such a compelling case for beauty and the importance of beauty and the arts .
in the 21st century , we face new challenges : aging , obesity , climate change , and so on .
it &apos;s an area the size of europe , 24 million people , one of the most deprived parts of the country .
i danced between chemo and radiation cycles and badgered him to fit it to my performing dance schedule .
durga , the fearless one .
the second challenge i have is that i must ask for understanding and even compassion when i talk about my son &apos;s death as a suicide .
but my son &apos;s death was not purely a suicide .
he doesn &apos;t know , but he can show you . &quot; &quot; so his hands know and his intuition knows , but sometimes what we know gets in the way of what could be , especially when it comes to the human-made , human-built world .
so this is &quot; &quot; the star-spangled banner &quot; &quot; by eating lunch , including drinking listerine .
so i asked him , &quot; &quot; what is that ? &quot; &quot; he was sweating .
we could hear in the air the bullets passing .
this relation between a living thing , which is the forest , and a nonliving thing , which is the atmosphere , is ingenious in the amazon , because the forest provides water and seeds , and the atmosphere forms the rain and gives water back , guaranteeing the forest &apos;s survival .
what phenomenon — if it &apos;s not a desert , what phenomenon makes water gush from the ground into the atmosphere with such power that it can be seen from space ?
why aren &apos;t palestinians using nonviolent resistance ?
a week later , they held the most well-attended and disciplined demonstration to date .
i &apos;m going to divert and talk about bananas and chocolate .
take out those who say they save too little .
and they do it because they don &apos;t have enough information .
they &apos;re the people who quit their jobs so they can post on youtube videos all day long .
and yet here we are today , about half of the rainforest remains , and we have potentially more urgent problems like climate change .
it &apos;s actually singing to each other over a great distance .
i think there &apos;s nothing like a crisis to tell you what &apos;s really important and what &apos;s not , and sandy made me realize that our devices and their connectivity matter to us right up there with food and shelter .
now , the flow of time is embedded in everything , in the erosion of a grain of sand , in the budding of a little bud into a rose .
we know that when you invest in research , you get results .
now , linda received the right treatment .
that has sent the professional class of publishing down into the ranks of mass amateurization .
in france , a bus company is suing people for forming a carpool , right , because the fact that they have coordinated themselves to create cooperative value is depriving them of revenue .
so , with one microfluidic chip , which is the size of an iphone , you can actually diagnose 100 patients at the same time .
and i &apos;m sure everyone here enjoys cell phones that can actually be used in the remote areas of the world , in the third world countries .
elizabeth lev : the effect of the last judgment was enormous .
now , this does lead us to one odd thing .
another benefit of wi-fi , we learned yesterday about the benefits of wi-fi .
( laughter ) any lady , any lady ? thank you very much .
we could solve our energy problems ; we can reduce co2 , ; we could clean up our oceans ; we could make better wine .
look at this screen here and , you know , you see pictures and you see words , but really all there are are ones and zeros .
it &apos;s hard to know .
thank you very much .
run the movie , please .
if you look at the math , e = mc squared , if you look at the cosmological constant , where there &apos;s an anthropic ideal , where you see that life had to evolve from the numbers that describe the universe — these are things that are really difficult to understand .
so we &apos;re able to bring the camera right up to the elephant , put food into the elephant &apos;s mouth , show people what &apos;s going on inside their mouths , and show everyone around the world how incredible these animals really are .
this dolphin has self-awareness .
it &apos;s too late then .
within six months , i had returned to work .
walk the talk .
what did get me moving was a social interaction .
it was happening to us for real .
then , after spending the night on the beach , we found a jetty and coconuts .
meta-narratives that make universal claims failed us in the 20th century and are failing us in the 21st .
it wouldn &apos;t be fair to end this talk without putting myself on the line and making some predictions .
it &apos;s a world where information itself becomes intelligent and comes to us automatically when we need it without having to look for it .
and i know that many of you will be concerned about the impact that innovation might have on jobs .
the day i gave her the photos also happened to be her youngest son &apos;s 14th birthday .
we got dirty , and we loved it .
it was a trust and a slow surrender that deepened with every reading of the quran .
and yet , something didn &apos;t feel right .
we &apos;re talking to them about appreciating vultures , about the need from within to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that they provide .
recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no vultures , carcasses take up to three to four times to decompose , and this has huge ramifications for the spread of diseases .
you know , blogs are scary . this is what you see .
i am not that caring .
i am kind of a pop culture nerd , and i think a lot about what makes a strong female character , and , you know , movies and tv shows , these things have influence . my own website .
so all of that being said , i still really appreciate those characters in movies and articles like that on our site , that aren &apos;t just about being totally powerful , maybe finding your acceptance with yourself and self-esteem and your flaws and how you accept those .
and what i mean by that is , you know , you can transcend space by simply making a voice call , right ?
this one &apos;s a little bit more sophisticated , and this is from a study that we did in uganda about how people who are sharing devices , use those devices .
two , that i needed another sponsor , and fast .
one day , i got to present my research to a roomful of mba students .
we actually floated an apple in homage to sir isaac newton because professor hawking holds the same chair at cambridge that isaac newton did .
and i said , &quot; &quot; i can &apos;t take you there , but i can take you into weightlessness into zero-g .
a lot of buildings are operated this way , probably where you work , and companies do this to save money on their energy bill .
so at 12 o &apos;clock , you &apos;ll see that offices have a lot of alphaproteobacteria , and at one o &apos;clock you &apos;ll see that bacilli are relatively rare .
south africans just make music really freely .
you won &apos;t make the key otherwise .
same thing for processor speeds .
ju : no , it has to be for every human being .
and the laptop was running windows 98 .
and she &apos;s been doing this for 30 years .
the nervous system has plasticity .
these glial cells become activated .
so our first step in restoring the dreams of those parents is to answer the question : why are babies dying ?
and there was a pretty big section of that pie chart , about 40 percent — 40 percent was labeled &quot; &quot; neonatal . &quot; &quot; now , &quot; &quot; neonatal &quot; &quot; is not a cause of death .
let &apos;s run this video .
rb : it smiles . she imitates the smile . this happens a lot .
tens of millions of them are thinking all the time ; they have code attached to them .
and so , the multicultural nature and the sort of cultural melting pot that &apos;s happening inside second life is quite — i think , quite remarkable relative to what in real human terms in the real world we &apos;ve ever been able to achieve .
now , in order to do this we and the clients had to do something fairly remarkable .
and so this technology already had all the failsafe mechanisms and allowed the theater and our client to actually do this with confidence that they would be able to change over their configurations at will .
but sometimes we are only five doctors and 16 nurses , and we are physically getting exhausted to see all of them .
ha : the people who are coming to us , we are welcoming .
cvs is the one that used to be the most commonly used , and i hated cvs with a passion and refused to touch it and tried something else that was radical and interesting and everybody else hated .
and i think the two things are related .
what are their angles ?
now unfortunately , i can &apos;t show you that video .
but he gave me a cup of tea .
the mosque where the respectful foreigner is showered with blessings and with tears , and welcomed as a gift .
use the internet . go on the internet .
people say , &quot; &quot; what &apos;s the solution ? &quot; &quot; here it is .
it was a train loaded with frozen turkeys — they say , at thanksgiving — from the meatpacking district .
it turns out we were wrong on that .
because emma lazarus was right .
i can be a part of this conversation .
it &apos;s this well-organized absence of information that draws us in .
we &apos;re born problem solvers .
it &apos;s interesting , because history is driven to a large degree by the size of cities .
so and then when you compare the lifetime emissions of these various energy forms , nuclear is about even with solar and wind , and ahead of solar — oh , i &apos;m sorry — with hydro and wind , and ahead of solar .
she completely rejected her family — her children , her husband .
the families were struggling with things much bigger than they could cope with .
a huge amount of hope was generated by that enormous movement that was going on in the region .
for example — i mean , it &apos;s a country the size of texas , more or less .
the thing is becoming faster and that &apos;s why i think it seems so confusing .
so what we do is we put inside the machine a process of evolution that takes place on the microsecond time scale .
so i &apos;m very excited now .
but we still did it .
and india is , and must remain , in my view , the land of the better story .
if it &apos;s population , we &apos;re on course to top the charts .
unfortunately , some very important images are deemed too graphic or disturbing for us to see them .
let &apos;s go back a little .
but i think it should fascinate you too , because i said puncture is everywhere .
and newton says the wall is going to apply force back , equal and opposite .
people marched to demand — okay , not really exactly like that — but they rose up and they demanded that intel fix the flaw .
a total of 200 people joined us across this walk , as we went from the very top to the very bottom of new hampshire talking about this issue .
in fact , it &apos;s not even really sequenced that much .
we made a chip that has every known virus ever discovered on it .
endurance and ultra-endurance sports serve as a great example .
usain bolt starts to catch him .
but this time it &apos;s not a tiger at the cave mouth .
but we see , mistakenly , each of these issues as individual problems to be solved .
in their bids to kill , i got the police on standby , and they came that fateful morning to come and kill the child .
i was a young reporter . i had just come out of college .
we need to remove the perverse incentives to use more fuel .
it &apos;s become this intense industrialized zone .
i &apos;m a garbage man .
and if you throw in other durable goods like automobiles and so forth , that number well more than doubles .
i &apos;ve designed puzzles for books , printed things .
well , let &apos;s first of all simplify the vases illusion , make the thing on the right .
the statue is the reference , and it connects the identity of leonardo to those three faces .
now , are they made in the right order ?
you &apos;re just squeezing air out , and each of those contractions — ha ! — gives you a sound .
everybody underestimates how often they laugh , and you &apos;re doing something , when you laugh with people , that &apos;s actually letting you access a really ancient evolutionary system that mammals have evolved to make and maintain social bonds , and clearly to regulate emotions , to make ourselves feel better .
so you really needed something on your wrist to tell you : what time is it on the earth ? what time is it on mars ?
( laughter ) so we have the watches and the language , and you &apos;re detecting a theme here , right ?
and the chance that some of it isn &apos;t more intelligent than ours is also a remote idea .
he wants two trillion dollars to protect us from terrorists next year , a two-trillion-dollar federal budget , which will land us back into deficit spending real fast .
i want to believe that paulie was right .
everyone asks about the smell .
she also explained that thomas had a secret code name .
so there i was , three months pregnant , with two trimesters ahead of me , and i had to find a way to manage my blood pressure and my stress .
td : so we ended up talking about the bamiyan buddhas , which , as you know , were destroyed some years ago in afghanistan .
td : so i think that sincere motivation is very important for our future well-being , or deep sense of well-being as humans , and i think that means sinking in to whatever it is you &apos;re doing now .
that just gives you an example of the kind of thing that these games probe . the interesting thing is , these games require that you have a lot of cognitive apparatus on line .
that is , you have to decide what that other person expects of you .
let me paint the picture for you .
just try to imagine your favorite beverage company trying to plan their inventory and not knowing how many bottles were on the shelves .
boards don &apos;t hit back .
got to do what i can to make sure i look good , and the reason i have to look real good , well , to tell you the truth , man , i don &apos;t know why . guess it makes me feel special inside .
in 1967 , in the middle of the biafran-nigerian civil war , dr. njoku-obi invented the cholera vaccine .
and fraser &apos;s on his knees , arms tied behind his back , and he &apos;s crying .
even as a child , i remember thinking that what i really wanted most in life was to be able to understand everything and then to communicate it to everyone else .
now this is doubly ironic when you consider that what gives comedy its edge at reaching around people &apos;s walls is the way that it uses deliberate misdirection .
he famously used thought experiments , which are essentially elaborate analogies , to come up with some of his greatest discoveries .
thank you very much .
so we &apos;ve argued that human sexuality has essentially evolved , until agriculture , as a way of establishing and maintaining the complex , flexible social systems , networks , that our ancestors were very good at , and that &apos;s why our species has survived so well .
now this sets men and women up in an oppositional relationship .
we need to educate the staff .
in our school district , the way we afford this is our school district allocates .03 percent of the general fund towards nutrition services . and i think if every school district allocated a half to one percent , we could start to really fix this program .
so , what he found is that in all cases of thumb mutations , instead of having a thumb , you would either get another opposable thumb , or you would get four fingers .
so , a new vocabulary of form is now pervading all design fields : whether it &apos;s automobiles , architecture , products , etc . , it &apos;s really being affected by this digital medium of curvature .
are you ready to go ? ok .
( laughter ) ( applause )
that &apos;s called blocking .
and that &apos;s why i teach my students a more realistic schema .
so then of the energy that does get to the wheels , only an eighth of it , half of that , goes to heat the tires on the road , or to heat the air the car pushes aside .
now , in order to do this we need to invest about 180 billion dollars : half of it to retool the car , truck and plane industries ; half of it to build the advanced bio-fuel industry .
so , it &apos;s tony blair reading and practicing his speech ; i &apos;ve got them doing yoga inside there with carole caplin ; sven making out with ulrika jonsson , who he was having an affair with at that time .
and margaret thatcher visiting jeffery archer in jail .
however , neuromodulation does not mean neuro-repair .
this , we don &apos;t know .
because they help people share news .
if you had a large red button of this kind , on the wall of your home , and every time you pressed it , it saved 50 dollars for you , put 50 dollars into your pension , you would save a lot more .
chernobyl , bhopal , the challenger , vioxx , weapons of mass destruction , hanging chads .
that &apos;s the planet we live on . don &apos;t pretend it isn &apos;t .
let &apos;s hear from tony hayward again .
but the truth is that , on average , turning that gunk into crude oil produces about three times more greenhouse gas pollution than it does to produce conventional oil in canada .
( laughter ) the whole notion , then , is one that at the interface there are physical properties in that transducer — in this case it &apos;s pressure and touches — that allow you to present things to the user that you could never present before .
then the second part will really just be examples of new technologies — new media falling very much into that mold .
( applause )
from my years as a social justice activist , i know very well that we need credible facts from media institutions combined with the powerful voices of storytellers .
the law of the administrative modernization says that the communication between the state and the people should be simple , clear , concise , meaningful , without acronyms , bla bla bla ...
so , next time you come across with a document you don &apos;t understand , demand to understand , put aside your pride and ask until you get completely cleared .
so in every car crash in which at least one person dies , they have information on all of the people .
so i just wanted you to look at this .
the one over tunguska was probably made of rock , and that &apos;s much more crumbly , so it blew up in the air . either way , these are tremendous explosions , 20 megatons .
the purpose was to make a crater to excavate the material and see what was underneath the surface of this comet , which we learned quite a bit about .
so it &apos;s a little bit like microsoft kinect , where you interact with gestures in the world .
so i really enjoyed looking at these projects and interacting with these projects .
some of you might know that , in 1990 , depp got engaged to winona ryder , and he had tattooed on his right shoulder &quot; winona forever . &quot;
because of course , sometimes we do make decisions that have irrevocable and terrible consequences , either for our own or for other people &apos;s health and happiness and livelihoods , and in the very worst case scenario , even their lives .
so kind of out of desperation , i decided that i could think laterally .
and for about five seconds , the toaster toasted , but then , unfortunately , the element kind of melted itself .
he voted in favor of the bill , in favor of a law that would allow businesses to not serve me .
when i read that in the advocate magazine this year , i realized i could no longer afford to keep silent .
like , just , go out , and , you know , do your best .
so he was there when i woke up , and it was , waking up was like breaking through the ice into a frozen lake of pain .
i don &apos;t know why , but i &apos;m continually amazed to think that two and a half billion of us around the world are connected to each other through the internet and that at any point in time more than 30 percent of the world &apos;s population can go online to learn , to create and to share .
at the same time i installed my own collusion profile , i installed one for my daughter .
and as de vaucanson was designing his robot musician , he had another idea .
someone came up with the brilliant idea of triggering sounds by pressing small levers with our fingers , inventing the first musical keyboard .
and it &apos;s called music .
( laughter ) these are some of them with their eyes centered .
we &apos;ve lots of blood vessels in there .
and if we think about the different types of tissues that people are looking at regenerating all over the world , in all the different labs in the world , there &apos;s pretty much every tissue you can think of .
a pool of delicious nectar lies at the bottom of each flower &apos;s long flute .
and that sequence was especially difficult .
i was eager to go off to college , and go find girls , and study , and girls , and study , but then i finished college and i fell in love .
this is a partnership between mit and a group of companies — google is involved , red hat — and amd is a key player .
it &apos;s true . it &apos;s true .
and you &apos;ve all made these advancements happen in such a short time — you &apos;re all so young .
man 2 : the brand that i am is , i would call it casual fly .
( laughter ) it &apos;s unpredictable — ( music ) ( laughter ) like this odd country road .
have sex .
there &apos;s got to be a middle way .
and for those on the outside , just as father damien did , the research community needs to immerse itself in indigenous culture or die trying .
now you don &apos;t need a phd to see that that leaves four percent for the rest of diversity .
you let it cool to room temperature , and then , as the ammonia re-evaporates and combines with the water back on the erstwhile hot side , it creates a powerful cooling effect .
adam grosser : so 29 years ago , i had this thermo teacher who talked about absorption and refrigeration .
the deterioration of my eyes shattered the illusion .
i believed mine until it broke apart .
because in the mean time , the german constitutional court ruled that the implementation of this e.u. directive into german law was unconstitutional .
these are 35,830 lines of information .
apple is a seller of luxury goods .
ios is made by apple . android is made by google .
( laughter ) now they &apos;ve introduced these four ways of looking at technology , these four stages of technology &apos;s life .
india had , still has , a regulated phone system and so did we .
so unless you happened to be a shareholder of one or the other organizations or one of the dealmakers or lawyers involved in the no-doubt lucrative activity , you &apos;re actually engaging in a huge piece of activity that meant absolutely bugger-all to anybody , okay ?
and there &apos;s to some extent a big strategy myth that &apos;s prevalent in business now .
over 20,000 economists whose job it is , competitive entry to get there , couldn &apos;t see what was happening .
these will be redundant concepts . and this isn &apos;t only something of the west .
successful innovation is not a single breakthrough .
we do our best , based upon our training and the way the cancer looks and the way it feels and its relationship to other structures and all of our experience , we say , you know what , the cancer &apos;s gone .
on one side you were talking with people around the table — and that was a nice , constructive discussion .
when powerful people misused their privilege , we were going to get them .
and i became a poetry critic because i wanted to know how and why .
fears of my bed , fears of life and fears of death , run away .
( laughter ) ( applause ) now that is called the huf haus .
and whilst i &apos;m painting i have to be very careful , because the paint starts to turn into little blobs .
the teacher only raises the question , and then stands back and admires the answer .
and just one last thing .
i model the possible climates of exoplanets .
but spacecraft measurements revealed a different story .
why is it that they can withstand the loss of so much of their bark ?
and as soon as that happened , the birds started moving in .
these movements as a whole purvey discrimination against religious minorities and sexual minorities .
they take different forms .
alive .
i was a young australian woman doing extraordinary things in london .
yes , some of these young people are connected to the internet , but the connectivity in the arab world is very little , is very small , because of many problems that we are suffering from .
and then you have yemen .
and that , of course , is what we are all now threatened with today because of electronic tattoos .
&#91; allegiance &#93; &#91; very intimate &#93; &#91; serious mistakes &#93; ( laughter ) and tattoos tell you a lot of stories .
one might think reading these books — and i &apos;ve gotten thousands of letters about them by people who do think this — that based on my life &apos;s history as i &apos;ve portrayed in the books , my early life &apos;s history , i am someone who has overcome adversity .
i really honestly believe that the basic problem here is pure depression , and all of the obsessional thinking comes out of it .
and they did , but eventually , they died anyway .
( sighs ) there was a thunderstorm here this morning .
and the stories of heroism go well beyond just a kid getting a few extra chicken nuggets on their lunch tray .
my lunch lady had grandkids , and therefore kids , and therefore left school at the end of the day ?
think about how you &apos;d feel sticking it in your wallet .
don &apos;t worry , i &apos;m not going to call anyone in particular out on any aspects of your own mistakes .
they take them back and give me the money or give me the pair of socks of the color i wanted .
calling the task rebuilding trust , i think , also gets things backwards .
and so you can imagine , even in this application , that in a high-rise building where the panel systems go from floor to floor up to 30 , 40 floors , the entire surface could be differentiated at different times of day depending on how that sun moves across and hits that surface .
and what it basically implies is that , in houses now , we don &apos;t need drapes or shutters or blinds anymore because we can sheath the building with these things , as well as control the amount of air conditioning you need inside that building .
andrew ng : so in large-scale machine learning , we &apos;d like to come up with computational ...
this is from stanford &apos;s computer science 101 class , and the students are supposed to color-correct that blurry red image .
we want to pretend that mexico has the flu .
what if none of these things is the problem ?
( music ) well this sounds very melancholic , doesn &apos;t it ?
it was an experience of being totally in awe of the music , and i had not felt that in a long time .
the first day with the congestion charges looked like this .
this is a map of stockholm , my hometown .
but if you look closely , you &apos;ll notice that it lacks a brain .
now , notice those bright red screws magnified in the sculpture .
now all of these are fine projects , but they really have missed an essential point , which is it &apos;s not about the leaves above , it &apos;s about the systems below .
increasingly , we &apos;re realizing that we don &apos;t even need to densify an entire city .
now i want to stipulate , as the lawyers say , that lolcats are the stupidest possible creative act .
that , we get for free .
this acting student stood up after 30 seconds , and said , &quot; i solved everything . what do i do now ? &quot;
so , we try to test this .
this was a very widely reported incident in telford and shropshire in march this year .
the blade fell , the head fell into a basket , out of sight immediately , and they called out , &quot; give me back my gallows , give me back my wooden gallows . &quot;
we have demonstrated that our model works .
you will find humans chasing higher education .
but until i had actually talked to venus , i would have had no idea that none of those approaches actually addressed why she had to watch her son die .
you see , venus was thrown into destitution by violence .
he &apos;s recognized as being the father of video games in europe .
in all my driving games , i &apos;ve driven a total of 31,459 miles .
my students and i work on very tiny robots .
but ultimately we want to add everything onboard the robot .
( laughter ) she should not go into banking , for example , or work at a cash register .
they were happy . they had their plans .
and al-jebr roughly translates to &quot; the system for reconciling disparate parts . &quot;
that &apos;s one of the reasons so much of what we &apos;ve come to think of as western science and mathematics and engineering was really worked out in the first few centuries of the common era by the persians and the arabs and the turks .
it is rather revolting .
and when we look at the reason for poor quality water , you find that it is our abysmal attitude to the disposal of human waste .
and the highest rates of depression were urban women in north america .
it &apos;s time for this country to unite , if only to help the men and women who fought to protect us .
so the point is the republicans here recognize that there &apos;s a certain need of ownership , a respect for ownership , the respect we should give the creator , the remixer , the owner , the property owner , the copyright owner of this extraordinarily powerful stuff , and not a generation of sharecroppers .
and then in an extraordinarily bart simpson-like , juvenile way you &apos;ve actually got to type out these words and get them right to reassert your freedom to speak .
so that was what happened when we had a couple of — that &apos;s what happened when you had a couple of — ok , ok , ok — ( laughter ) — they don &apos;t like each other . so there &apos;s a different robot .
and you can see these robots are not ready to take over the world yet , but they gradually learn how to move forward , and they do this autonomously .
and you need to remember that to be good is not enough .
thank you .
and so i went to both — two race riots , one of which was the los angeles riot . and this next piece is from that .
and i got this in the maryland correctional institute for women .
and i learned that you have to give that in this environment , because it &apos;s tough .
we went down to the airfield early because this is the army and you always go early .
so i thought , this is what i really want to design , not a shopping mall .
and this is complemented by these small colored glasses that use the light from the inside of the building to light up the building at night .
the scramble for africa during the berlin conference of 1884 — where , quite frankly , we africans were not exactly consulted — ( laughter ) ( applause ) — resulted in massive fragmentation and many sovereign states with small populations : liberia , four million ; cape verde , 500,000 .
but for the problems we face in africa , when we are looking at the marshall plan to revitalize war-torn europe , it was not full of donations of sheep .
so this is peter eckert , who does his phd on this robot , and as you see , it &apos;s a cute little robot .
you can see that we have almost a one-to-one exact replay of the walking gait .
in 2007 , seven years later , 17 percent .
i want us to use this 25th anniversary to think about what sort of a web we want .
and what was striking to me is that the farmers actually had no clue what was made of their pigs , but the consumers — as in us — had also no idea of the pigs being in all these products .
so i sent this company an email saying , &quot; &quot; hello . i &apos;m christien . i &apos;m doing this research .
and i think by working together we can have both open government and private lives , and i look forward to working with everyone around the world to see that happen .
if i &apos;m the worst person in the world , you can hate me and move on .
this can take us several months to complete .
i photographed for 26 hours in a sealed crocodile blind , 18 feet in the air .
it does the things that i need it to do , and i &apos;ve learned to use it to the best of its capacity just as you have , and that &apos;s the thing about those kids in those pictures as well .
they &apos;re not doing anything out of the ordinary .
boys &apos; brains are being digitally rewired in a totally new way for change , novelty , excitement and constant arousal .
and this peaks at super bowl sunday when guys would rather be in a bar with strangers , watching a totally overdressed aaron rodgers of the green bay packers , rather than jennifer lopez totally naked in the bedroom .
that &apos;s called the circular flow of the economy .
the savings ratio , net savings , were below zero in the middle of 2008 , just before the crash .
it was a bit like finishing a marathon and getting out of solitary confinement and winning an oscar all rolled into one .
other people will see if you &apos;re in the supermarket line and you pull out your reusable grocery bag .
not only can you say how many notes , it &apos;s being able to play them all at the same time . here we are .
( piano notes ) you can see how — you get a sense of playing with derek .
i &apos;d like to tell you that it &apos;s also for self-knowledge .
my heart rate was 61 beats per minute — my blood pressure , 127 over 74 .
( laughter ) i &apos;m also a software engineer , and i make lots of different kinds of art with the computer .
i &apos;m overtime , so i just wanted to say you can , if you &apos;re in new york , you can check out my work at the whitney biennial next week , and also at bitforms gallery in chelsea .
and the other one was to design the object and make sure that it was a consumer product and not a research tool .
and a group at itch , which is now part of ideo , designed this interactive wall that &apos;s about four stories tall .
and the third is all of the sound that we humans generate that &apos;s called anthrophony .
well , i was wrong . what i learned from these encounters was that careful listening gives us incredibly valuable tools by which to evaluate the health of a habitat across the entire spectrum of life .
everything has motion , he claims , even a body as paralyzed as his own .
we never stagnate .
and it also supports working-class kids going into indian schools .
and luckily , he met this guy , who is rodrigo baggio , the owner of the first laptop to ever appear in brazil .
i was clean . there wasn &apos;t a bloody leak in the place , it was just fantastic .
( laughter ) rsw : did it leak ?
eb : so i want to just point out here that every node is a talk , they &apos;re linked if they share similar ideas , and that comes from a machine reading of entire talk transcripts , and then all these topics that pop out , they &apos;re not from tags and keywords .
they come from the network structure of interconnected ideas . keep going .
in the tradition of the palestinian society , it &apos;s forbidden for men to enter the household .
when my children were small and we heard the sound of the war , i used to tell them that they were fireworks .
america spends more money on education than most other countries .
there he is . he &apos;s dieting .
in the year 1901 , a woman called auguste was taken to a medical asylum in frankfurt .
we understand less about the science of alzheimer &apos;s than other diseases because we &apos;ve invested less time and money into researching it .
a lot of work from the ground up is needed .
but let &apos;s not kid ourselves .
this is an approach that has been developed by a couple researchers at dartmouth medical school , lisa schwartz and steven woloshin .
the last one i &apos;ll show you is a psa test .
let me just tell you two really quickly .
so it had its downsides .
it &apos;s more profound than that .
we do this in other parts of the globe , too .
my name is sarah brown wessling .
some teachers are far more effective than others .
but despite our electoral mandate , the markets mistrusted us .
so how then do we reunite the two halves of the agora ?
and — they don &apos;t throw it at each other , but this is a fundamental part of being playful .
and so now i &apos;m going to take you through sort of a way of looking at play , but it &apos;s never just singularly one thing .
it &apos;s as if the whole population had to shift from being basses to singing as a tenor .
the biologists continued to be skeptical of the long-range communication issue well past the &apos; 70s , until the end of the cold war .
the year after it was finished in 2004 , you could do the same job for 20 million dollars in three to four months .
evolution is all about passing on the genome to the next generation , adapting and surviving through generation after generation .
what i said about there being no non-aging species earlier on was a little bit of an oversimplification .
we can say that , fundamentally , the difference between gerontology and geriatrics is that gerontology tries to inhibit the rate at which metabolism lays down this damage .
our political and military leaders were telling us one thing and photographers were telling us another .
what happens at ground level , far from the halls of power , happens to ordinary citizens one by one .
in the culture and mythology of democracy , power resides with the people .
i mean , think about it : how does a friendship become a subsidy ?
you never had to be taught this rule , you just understand it .
so , for example , people are always telling you , &quot; be creative , make new music , do art , invent things , science and technology . &quot;
that &apos;s why you need not just be training in one specialty , but also acquire breadth in other fields , related to and even distant from your own initial choice .
in education , medicine , law , diplomacy , government , business and the media that exist today .
and we could exploit these multiple bounces of light .
how does light look in slow motion ?
when you play in a race , win ! — because when you win , the exhilaration of victory is the closest you will come to the ambrosia of the gods . &quot; &quot; because , you see , the greeks believed you live only once , and when you die , you have to cross the river styx .
hindus don &apos;t have the concept of commandments .
so there &apos;s plainly a lot more to do on the goals we &apos;ve got .
it &apos;s getting near zero .
when we think about mapping cities , we tend to think about roads and streets and buildings , and the settlement narrative that led to their creation , or you might think about the bold vision of an urban designer , but there &apos;s other ways to think about mapping cities and how they got to be made .
let &apos;s take a look at rio de janeiro .
they &apos;re psychiatrists .
in fact , they rank higher than other governments , like my own , the u.s. , or switzerland , that have higher average levels of income but lower rankings on work-life balance .
and selling the furniture — the house was loaded with people .
so much so , the word &quot; &quot; father &quot; &quot; — i have six kids by the way .
that &apos;s my question .
the shape is the second thing .
these are parts being printed with multi-material properties .
so this isn &apos;t expensive pumps or valves .
of course , lying is not the only situation that will evoke our hidden emotions .
and the caller says , &quot; i am my father . &quot;
and each of these can vary by country .
rights management is no longer simply a question of ownership , it &apos;s a complex web of relationships and a critical part of our cultural landscape .
( applause ) chris anderson : so your idea worth spreading is hire hackers .
nonetheless , in an unexpected attack of hubris a couple of years ago , i decided i would try and do that .
run it through the separator and you &apos;re ready to use it .
i know the response to this .
others look at her before moving off .
the first walks around the badly injured toddler completely .
like a lot of my ideas , like a lot of the tools i use , i found it in the garden ; i &apos;m a very devoted gardener .
but that day , it occurred to me : what if that grammar is nothing more than a self-serving conceit ?
not little green humanoids arriving in shiny ufos , although that would be nice .
there &apos;s a special patch of the sky where we have thousands of planets .
&quot; ad-hoc peer-to-peer self-configuring wireless networks . &quot;
what &apos;s the wireless technology we &apos;re going to use ?
now about half the audience has their left hand up . why is that ?
man : yes .
in south africa , ndebele women use these symbols and other geometric patterns to paint their homes in bright colors , and the zulu women use the symbols in the beads that they weave into bracelets and necklaces .
most probably , one of humanity &apos;s greatest achievements is the invention of the alphabet , and that has been attributed to mesopotamia with their invention of cuneiform in 1600 bc , followed by hieroglyphics in egypt , and that story has been cast in stone as historical fact .
that &apos;s an academic question .
i don &apos;t want to suggest that they are a single thing that you can point to .
it &apos;s been four years , and i &apos;ve still never been as well as i was the minute before i walked home from my neurologist &apos;s office .
but here i am today , with you , and that is a miracle .
in groups as large as 150 and as small as three , these young people discovered new places , new thoughts , new perspectives .
but within the reels lie purpose and meaning .
so during the chicago mayoral election there was a parody account .
i think in nonfiction real-time storytelling , there are a lot of really excellent examples as well .
and together with this new type of interfaces , we can use these technologies and apply them to safer cars for sighted people .
so for this , we developed many different types of non-visual user interface technology .
now , how many people here think the trump number is higher for the fruit fly ?
i don &apos;t think they &apos;re a simple model of anything .
so many people have access to information , but there &apos;s no follow-up to that .
i realized that not everybody can be able to access what i was able to access .
so now , behind me is an animation of the extracellular matrix .
thank you very much .
but there &apos;s another type of transformation that occupies a very different emotional space .
you know , frankly , i &apos;m not that good , but i do have one distinct capability ; i am remarkably fast at finding my bike .
3,000 employees . he kept every one of them on the payroll .
and there isn &apos;t a formula to tell you how to get the people behind you , because different people in different communities organize their lives in different ways .
ec : yeah .
so why don &apos;t you give them a little history — just a tickle — a bit of history of where it comes from .
i &apos;m not defining a good family from a bad family .
i slowly became aware that i knew nobody that knew me for longer than a year .
and that as we worry about our next job in the office , the next design that we can get , to keep our workers .
the question is , as a building professional , as an architect , an engineer , as a developer , if you know this is going on , as we go to the sights every single week , are you complacent or complicit in the human rights violations ?
instead , males used their fantastic antennae to sniff out perfumes given off by their females .
for the most part , these adult fireflies don &apos;t get eaten because like their juveniles they can manufacture toxins that are repellent to birds and other insectivores , but somewhere along the line , one particular group of fireflies somehow lost the metabolic machinery needed to make their own protective toxins .
why don &apos;t we take the source from the person we want the voice to sound like , because it &apos;s preserved , and borrow the filter from someone about the same age and size , because they can articulate speech , and then mix them ?
i &apos;d like to talk today about a powerful and fundamental aspect of who we are : our voice .
and pretty soon it &apos;s going to be possible to avoid virtually all genetic diseases in that way .
we look the same to a visitor from another planet , maybe , but not to each other because we compete with each other all time .
the new york times called this building a miracle .
transportation speeds up : you can take a boat , you can take a plane , you can be a tourist .
and so then this community formed of people who shared this big inside joke and they started talking about it and doing things with it .
any one of you could be famous on the internet by next saturday .
so that &apos;s one reason to think that we might be declensionists , going in the wrong direction .
you could see arguments on both sides .
washington , d.c. , last year , actually led the nation in new green roofs installed , and they &apos;re funding this in part thanks to a five-cent tax on plastic bags .
the larger point i &apos;m trying to make is this .
so every year , june 16 , we will commemorate all those comrades or students who died .
i ’ d like to dedicate this one to all the women in south africa — those women who refused to dwindle in the midst of apartheid .
but i do have to be concerned with those things .
there . good .
( video ) toyin alousa : nollywood is the best thing that can happen to them .
he influences you really good , you know .
beyond this horizon we don &apos;t know where we are coming from .
and it also discovered traces of methane .
chris urmson : sure .
we &apos;ve made the car stronger .
and i wanted this guy to be involved in my crazy project , and he was kind enough to lend his image to the character of eugène spaak , who is a cosmologist and artist who seeks relation in between time , space , love , music and women .
and it seems like every department had nothing , so they had to rely on our creativity and turn every problem into an opportunity .
a group of artists decided to paint a life-size tank on a wall . it &apos;s one to one .
authority comes , paints the wall white , leaves the tank , leaves the suit , and throws a bucket of black paint just to hide the face of the monster .
but i got sent to jerusalem to make a film about early christianity .
and in particular , every single one of the major world traditions has highlighted — has said — and put at the core of their tradition what &apos;s become known as the golden rule .
now i have spoken my last words , and i don &apos;t even remember for sure what they were .
when i type anything , this voice will speak whatever i type .
and this is about a little over four billion years ago .
and as they pick that , these become bone , and then they pick another road and these become platelets , and these become macrophages , and these become t cells .
the first thing they did was to recognize the specificity of political jurisdiction inscribed in that empty space .
as an artist , i &apos;ve been interested , in fact , in the visualization of citizenship , the gathering of many anecdotes , urban stories , in order to narrativize the relationship between social processes and spaces .
we start with a charter that specifies all the rules required to attract the people who we &apos;ll need to build the city .
how would we write the treaty to do that ?
if you think your poverty is god &apos;s will , you pray .
and if we &apos;re lucky , it might even be important .
( applause )
but what you find are not the human remains , such as selam and lucy , on a day-to-day basis .
because a father is locked in does not mean he should be locked out of his daughter &apos;s life .
because our daddies are our mirrors that we reflect back on when we decide about what type of man we deserve , and how they see us for the rest of our lives .
and so gradual consensus is becoming that language can shape thought , but it tends to be in rather darling , obscure psychological flutters .
and these are factors that set in early , and so that ought to give you some sense of when to give junior or juniorette lessons in another language .
this ended up becoming a cover story at national geographic .
this is a low-altitude photograph that i made showing our dive boat with about a dozen of these big old tiger sharks sort of just swimming around behind .
so i prepared for moments like these as best i could .
so now i &apos;d like to share with you what &apos;s in my suitcase today .
or maybe we should be out in the street in front of a greyhound bus or a vehicle .
and women shouldn &apos;t have to spend four hours a day looking for it , or watching their kids die .
we &apos;ve got to start having conversations like this , and i don &apos;t think there &apos;s any better way to start than using the market , but also to bring other people to the table around it .
they buy it , they dry it and they bring it to this factory , which was purchased in part by , again , patient capital from novartis , who has a real interest in getting the powder so that they can make coartem .
they don &apos;t want second-standard , second-quality outputs .
is it that i articulate very well ?
&quot; &quot; pick-up &quot; &quot; is to pick someone up , but not just any picking up — it &apos;s picking up chicks .
i know this , that &apos;s why love can be defined in a more accurate way as the desire of being desired .
so what we think , as earth scientists , is species are going to have to migrate with climate change from the east in brazil all the way west into the andes and up into the mountains in order to minimize their exposure to climate change .
what i &apos;m going to do is i &apos;m going to take you on a high-resolution , first-time tour of the carbon landscapes of peru and then panama .
she said this loudly .
and they further learn this through the lack of teachers that look like them .
what does it mean for one thing to be both vibrating and not vibrating at the same time ?
and for example , this would be somebody who &apos;s completely logical .
and i was saying , you don &apos;t know this molecule really well , but your body knows it extremely well .
and trying to attach this to things that were themselves attached to certain specific target zones , bacteria that we don &apos;t like .
all of us have to have a commitment to do that .
and the drill sergeant starts screaming at them , and telling them to do all kinds of awful things .
so we are really duplicating the kind of signals that you have on the optic nerve .
so that &apos;s the question . the question is , how much — they are doing a similar amount of processing , similar amount of data — the question is how much energy or electricity does the brain use ?
it &apos;s a fast , cheap device that answers an important question : is this water contaminated ?
it &apos;s in its early stages , but this is what it looks like right now .
the greatest hope for humanity lies not in condemning violence but in making violence obsolete .
the government arrested everyone , and that was the end of that .
so it &apos;s not very effective , but it &apos;s probably the best thing we &apos;ve got at the moment .
if they don &apos;t find a female , then they &apos;ll die anyway .
however this is still a minority for the very lack of knowledge .
( laughter ) on the middle , this guy nested a couple of weeks after the release .
i say , &quot; &quot; here &apos;s my email address .
there are a lot of things going on in that sense .
it could depend on the nature of the pathogen — different pathogens , using this technique , you &apos;d get different warning — or other phenomena that are spreading , or frankly , on the structure of the human network .
so , if you look at nodes a and b , they both have six connections .
kurt andersen : like many architects , david is a hog for the limelight but is sufficiently reticent — or at least pretends to be — that he asked me to question him rather than speaking .
one of the other things is this is designed to be moveable .
overall , the weaknesses in the methods of research on pms have been considerable .
everybody , right ?
it &apos;s just a wall .
the border wall is nothing .
and their uncertainties were present long before they even were parents .
well .
i felt so connected to this world .
but it didn &apos;t work out . ( laughter ) i went to art school .
so in 10 , 12 generations , you &apos;re going to have thousands of offspring , and millions of offspring .
goodbye .
the bop is a type of social dance .
why do we dance ?
they cram them onto cots , put all your personal belongings in a plastic garbage bag , stick it underneath , and put you on the floor of an entire sports arena , or a gymnasium .
forty-two million people were displaced by natural disasters in 2010 .
so the conventional business model in the west is more for more .
when external resources are scarce , you have to go within yourself to tap the most abundant resource , human ingenuity , and use that ingenuity to find clever ways to solve problems with limited resources .
they start to run an awareness-raising program looking at how this might actually work in the town .
but let us honor what it has bought us , and move forward from this point .
you throw everything else away . you become a monomaniac — all you care about is not stepping out on that platform .
pollution , energy shortage , environmental diversity , poverty .
how does it work ?
but then i started noticing a disturbing trend .
but ...
just three examples .
it &apos;s not helping anyone , least of all you .
( laughter ) even when we saw the body , we knew better .
and we &apos;re really becoming very close to understanding the key steps that makes dead stuff come alive .
i think that perhaps the emergence of the first cells was as probable as the emergence of the stars .
the two marches joined together , and they continued their path towards the state capital .
it &apos;s very difficult to reconcile this with the image of faceless , ignorant goons that are just shooting each other , very difficult to reconcile .
we gave them cameras and training .
the youth can beat you .
okay .
and we wanted to try and encourage people to use energy better .
and in western europe mostly try to stay away from any long-distance relationships , big groupings , groupings that go back a long time , longer than the familiar families .
how many tens of thousands of years does it go back ?
it &apos;s actually moved from the survival base of the pyramid to becoming a transformational role model for the world .
i learned that economists measure everything in tangible units of production and consumption as if each of those tangible units is exactly the same .
we &apos;re also expanding the umvelt of pilots .
scott novich : you .
for example , i think of how one night , when i was around 12 years old , on an overnight field trip to another city , my friends and i bought super soakers and turned the hotel parking lot into our own water-filled battle zone .
you can &apos;t pretend to shoot guns .
yet , there was more energy coming in than going out .
there would be no stable shoreline .
it is about our own commitment to human rights .
the bureau of prisons describes cmus as &quot; &quot; self-contained housing units . &quot; &quot; but i think that &apos;s an orwellian way of describing black holes .
and this is in takaungu — we &apos;ve got a generator and a digital projector , and we &apos;re projecting it up against a barn , and showing one of the movies that they made .
and the way we &apos;ve done this — we teach digital storytelling to these kids .
and here he &apos;ll explain a little bit about what it does .
they &apos;re a little bit radical .
this , on a lighter note , is at george lucas &apos; personal archive .
and after i took this photograph , they constructed a wall around the world church of god to mimic the set-up of mosques in afghanistan or iraq .
and they could keep it going .
so it is important , i think , to richard , and to me , that these ideas not be abused and misused .
and it talks about where the cotton was grown and the fertilizers that were used and the consequences for soil of that fertilizer . and it mentions , for instance , that cotton is very resistant to textile dye ; about 60 percent washes off into wastewater .
thank you very much .
with the money made from the viral video , we were able to let students in our classroom all make their own game in a box .
i noticed a lot of people from very diverse backgrounds started coming to our workshops .
and in 1759 , he described to his grandson various things he was seeing .
finally , i think they are infinitely interesting and valuable , for giving one some insight as to how the brain works .
so i work in singapore at the moment , and this is a place that &apos;s really a leading place for desalination technology .
removing the salts from water — particularly seawater — through reverse osmosis is a critical technique for countries who do not have access to clean drinking water around the globe .
beam me up , scotty .
well to start to do this , we took a 3d printer and we started to print our beakers and our test tubes on one side and then print the molecule at the same time on the other side and combine them together in what we call reactionware .
now , this photo doesn &apos;t really do it justice .
but i still didn &apos;t feel like i was making the world a better place .
i got the feeling that my brain wanted to basically see it come back to life .
so what you &apos;re now going to see is how we actually did it .
like all our past creations and innovations , they may be used to improve the human condition or they may be misused and abused .
hexacopters and octocopters , with six and eight propellers , can provide redundancy , but quadrocopters are much more popular because they have the minimum number of fixed motor propeller pairs : four .
but if we &apos;re going to see what went wrong , we &apos;re going to end up with the same five revolutions .
now we have the reverse tendency .
well , the merchant bankers who brought the world to their knees may have been morally remiss , but they were cognitively very agile .
they said that is the dumbest thing you &apos;ve ever said .
beginning guys , it &apos;s like , they thrash , they thrash , they get 15 feet up — and they can do about 15 pull-ups right — and then they just flame out .
so hang in there , and you come up with some pretty peculiar solutions .
it &apos;s a greenhouse , where kids get told all about food and growing their own food .
the best image i know of this is from 650 years ago .
i said , &quot; &quot; don , what are some examples of sustainable proteins ? &quot; &quot; he said he didn &apos;t know . he would ask around .
she kind of set us up .
then these two fellows came along , and they were flying kites to develop the control systems that would ultimately enable powered human flight .
and their experiments with kites led to this momentous occasion , where we powered up and took off for the first-ever 12-second human flight .
and people are forced to come into the camps to get their safe drinking water .
so here is the &quot; &quot; thinking different &quot; &quot; bit .
and &quot; &quot; marble cake &quot; &quot; is significant because it is the channel that this group called anonymous organized .
we &apos;re sacrificing a lot of that , and i think in doing so , moving towards those things , we &apos;re losing something valuable .
moshe safdie : he was a real nomad .
he died in 1974 .
well , to go back to our original story , the parents have panicked . they &apos;ve locked all the doors .
so what is the solution ? it is , i believe , to embody within the rule of law rights to information .
so he made a channel in here , and the chest moves up and down in that channel .
( laughter ) and here is our factory in cape town where we make horses .
why ? well , the short story is , our sponsors split on us .
it is the market for all those people for whom there is no other market coming .
as nyu legal scholar helen nissenbaum tells us , we have laws and policies and norms that protect all kinds of information that &apos;s private , and it doesn &apos;t make a difference if it &apos;s digital or not .
and this can be because of class bias , racism or homophobia .
( laughter ) our reality right now is less interesting than the story we &apos;re going to tell about it later .
what this is doing is , we find a — ( laughter ) a direct collision — we find a direct collision between availability — and what &apos;s possible through availability — and a fundamental human need — which we &apos;ve been hearing about a lot , actually — the need to create shared narratives .
but this has a huge , huge impact on the environment .
and they worked absolutely very , very , very hard .
its initial version was skillfully mediated by senator george mitchell .
since the high in the early 1990s , with about 50 such civil wars ongoing , we now have 30 percent fewer such conflicts today .
i think we have to defuse the situation .
you just can &apos;t consider this insignificant .
we didn &apos;t know about doublearrow .
and one explanation would be that these parties , these service providers , are not cooperating .
so , i apply this sort of philosophy now to everything i do : sitting back and realizing the progression , how far you &apos;ve come at this day to this goal , you know .
but without having the silicon sock , i &apos;m just going to try slip in it .
when i first saw her , i thought she would be dead in a matter of days .
pm : thank you . bv : thank you . thanks very much .
you know why ? because they can &apos;t swim here .
through our cell phones , individually , we have those voices to compel them to change .
and it &apos;s probably surprising to many of you sitting in this room that it &apos;s not the time that matters , it &apos;s not the length of preservation , it &apos;s the consistency of the temperature of that preservation that matters most .
not surprising then again that a mammoth preserved in the permafrost will have something on the order of 50 percent of its dna being mammoth , whereas something like the columbian mammoth , living in a temperature and buried in a temperate environment over its laying-in will only have 3 to 10 percent endogenous .
if you work on two neurons , that &apos;s psychology . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) we have to have more theory , and it can come as much from the top down .
and the same is true of consciousness .
whereas all previous expeditions had failed to garner a single video glimpse of the giant , we managed six , and the first triggered wild excitement .
yet we have spent only a tiny fraction of the money on ocean exploration that we &apos;ve spent on space exploration .
you see the whole big picture ?
and then in 2000 , the map satellite was launched — the wmap — and it made somewhat better pictures .
howard is not so easily placated .
and the example he used was coffee .
it &apos;s the extracellular matrix , but in leather , it &apos;s the main building block .
it is where cell culture takes place .
( applause )
came to see me and said , &quot; &quot; 1,600 of the kids that we &apos;ve sent out have come back missing at least one full arm .
i &apos;ve had one of my assistants run the numbers .
then i did get an email back from him .
i looked into the face of her son sitting next to her , and his face was just riven with grief and confusion .
jody williams called it : it &apos;s good to meditate .
hail to the god of america , whose power the masses extol — convenience rules america ; convenience owns our soul .
toyed with her sister , or threatened her pimp .
that meant that grain could be traded across tremendous distances , and even across time — as far forward as 18 months into the future .
african farmers only use some 22 kilograms of fertilizer per hectare , compared to 144 in asia .
i began to try different mixtures , and i was blown away by how tiny changes in dosages dramatically changed my sense of self , my sense of who i was , my thinking , my behavior towards people .
so this was done with the highest-resolution brain scan systems available today , and their resolution has increased really about a thousandfold in the last several years .
that &apos;s the scale . the red line is obviously halfway to the pole .
we have to turn around and come back again .
&quot; this is the nsa . in god we trust . all others we track ! ! ! ! ! &quot;
but they are significant .
but let &apos;s accept the strangeness of some of our ideas .
it &apos;s an escape from our own competition , and our own dramas .
this furry little creature is a fresh young bee halfway emerged from its brood cell , and bees right now are dealing with several different problems , including pesticides , diseases , and habitat loss , but the single greatest threat is a parasitic mite from asia , varroa destructor .
this eventually destroys a hive because it weakens the immune system of the bees , and it makes them more vulnerable to stress and disease .
it was my grandfather who introduced me to the effects of combat on the psyche .
if you can , you &apos;re beginning to see the face of the invisible wounds of war , commonly known as post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury .
the reason i &apos;m so passionate about ending race medicine isn &apos;t just because it &apos;s bad medicine .
it &apos;s a well-known function called &quot; &quot; correcting for race . &quot; &quot; the problem with race medicine extends far beyond misdiagnosing patients .
and so with many privacy provisions put in place to protect everyone who was recorded in the data , we made elements of the data available to my trusted research team at mit so we could start teasing apart patterns in this massive data set , trying to understand the influence of social environments on language acquisition .
that environment , people , are in these tight feedback loops and creating a kind of scaffolding that has not been noticed until now .
and i &apos;d like to bring that experience to the desktop .
i think you can really enrich the way we browse our photographs and bring it to that kind of shoebox of , you know , photos with your family on the kitchen table kind of thing .
two things leap out at me .
i read the obituaries almost every day .
ehud is going into his third treatment , and then his fourth treatment .
and i started looking more and more into this .
and so there are a number of atavisms that can happen .
because evolution works , we actually have some evolutionary tools .
one large children &apos;s publisher ironically said that they didn &apos;t work with children .
it &apos;s the reason we &apos;re not in the dark ages anymore .
and he has to select it by touch using a virtual arm , an arm that doesn &apos;t exist .
the legends that you see in the movie don &apos;t appear for the monkey .
we were a little bit worried that people might think we &apos;d been choosing problems to suit our argument and just manufactured this evidence , so we also did a paper in the british medical journal on the unicef index of child well-being .
the other really important point i want to make on this graph is that , if you look at the bottom , sweden and japan , they &apos;re very different countries in all sorts of ways .
so that white material that you see in between the bark and the wood is the mycelial felt of the fungus , and what it &apos;s doing — it &apos;s actually slowly strangling the tree to death by preventing the flow of water and nutrients .
what you &apos;re looking at now is a tree called jomon sugi , living on the remote island of yakushima .
my lunch partner and i came away with some really important insights , and i &apos;m going to share just one with you .
&quot; liberalism is a mental disorder , &quot; &quot; rush limbaugh is a big fat idiot , &quot; &quot; pinheads and patriots , &quot; &quot; arguing with idiots . &quot;
embryonic stem cells have occupied center stage , chiefly because of their pluripotency — that is their ease in differentiating into a variety of different cell types .
in the following year .
whether or not you believe in it is based on your sense of is it raining more or is it raining less ?
this is what one of our cameras saw over the course of a few months .
we identified martina rojas and manuel chen .
whether it &apos;s a woman or a man .
so atmospheric escape is not specific to planet earth .
in the same way that you see gas streaming off from a hot jupiter , gas is going to stream off from the earth .
your child does not think you &apos;re that interesting .
( applause )
i even saw children , who looked the same age as me , filling up these clear plastic bottles with dirty water from streams on the roadside .
the composite combines titanium dioxide with cement .
mrs. alisch cut in front of the line and said , &quot; &quot; i taught him how to read . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) and then something happened that changed my life .
and i said , &quot; &quot; yes , i have a job . i write and illustrate children &apos;s books . &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; well , who pays you for that ? &quot; &quot; and i said , &quot; &quot; no one , no one , no one just yet .
it &apos;s that little bar there . he put his hand on the throttle .
and skiing along that first trip , i had two imaginary video clips that i &apos;d replay over and over again in my mind when the going got tough , just to keep my motivation going .
they decide what is too offensive or too provocative for you to see .
and i asked them to do a project together , tackle the issues affecting their country in cartoons , yes , in cartoons .
never mind the fact that the address led to a strip mall somewhere in northern l.a.
thank you .
your ears are always on — you have no ear lids .
and four modalities where you need to take some action and get involved .
at the time , she didn &apos;t realize that she was actually hitting on a bigger idea she later called service networking .
now , there &apos;s over 4,000 rabbits across the united states and 5,000 more on the waiting list .
we need better documentation of what &apos;s happening to the planet if we &apos;re ever going to have a chance of repairing the damage .
and what makes this scenario particularly appealing to me is we could do it today .
we need to understand software as well as just giving someone hardware .
but if you search for a stock photo of diarrhea in a leading photo image agency , this is the picture that you come up with .
because there &apos;s nothing in this . well , allegedly there &apos;s nothing .
so there is a danger to pseudoscience , in believing in this sort of thing .
but through a combination of luck and the persistence of several generations of researchers , this study has survived .
and living in the midst of good , warm relationships is protective .
and i &apos;m just going to read one of them to you .
i got an almost 100 percent response rate .
we should be talking about half , a quarter , one-tenth the energy content .
and what we &apos;ve discovered is , by using a part of the mushroom you &apos;ve probably never seen — analogous to its root structure ; it &apos;s called mycelium — we can actually grow materials with many of the same properties of conventional synthetics .
to have come to this place , lived to this moment : immeasurable lightness .
we need biofluorescence to show our true colors .
the first is managing our economies better .
the other thing was that conflicts decreased .
if we planted a warm , fuzzy memory involving a healthy food like asparagus , we could get people to want to eat asparagus more .
i study the opposite : when they remember , when they remember things that didn &apos;t happen or remember things that were different from the way they really were .
this is a bamboo bow , with 45-pound draw weights .
you need to console and communicate with the wood material .
it ended with a new synthesis : darwin &apos;s ideas and mendel &apos;s ideas blending together .
either they will go on for the next 40 years , 50 years , 60 years .
using a simple strategy to be replicated nationally , we designed a birthing center that would attract women and their attendants to come to the hospital earlier and therefore have safer births .
why was it that the best architects , the greatest architecture — all beautiful and visionary and innovative — is also so rare , and seems to serve so very few ?
i would still be on my bad hip . that was so disappointing .
i worked alone .
and finally , we also have an action gap .
and for older people ?
if you search amazon for the word &quot; &quot; creativity , &quot; &quot; you &apos;ll discover something like 90,000 books .
there are charts which show all these movements of information . that density of information is amazing .
with these three plants , you can grow all the fresh air you need .
and this particular plant removes formaldehydes and other volatile chemicals .
and so i became the head of neurophysiology for the clinical arm of this team , and we &apos;re finally able to use this technology towards actually helping children with brain disorders .
there were moments when he would actually space out for seconds at a time .
actually , it still has to cool down first before i can show you that the healing works .
so we took a lot of samples from this road and we tested them in the lab .
very often when i meet someone and they learn this about me , there &apos;s a certain kind of awkwardness .
what about 75 ?
by looking at the proportions and combinations of different kinds of pollen in a sample , you can tell very precisely where it came from .
but pollen forensics can be very subtle .
so each window is an image and is a world that i often revisit .
i take images from our global imagination , from cliché , from things we are thinking about , from history .
so forget the details . leave them out .
number eight : stay out of the weeds .
moderator : i was just wondering if you have anything more to share .
unless you are ill or very poor , you have choices .
well , tonight he sleeps safely with a stack of letters just like this one tucked beneath his pillow , scripted by strangers who were there for him when .
i wrote those same kinds of letters that my mother had written me for strangers , and tucked them all throughout the city , dozens and dozens of them . i left them everywhere , in cafes and in libraries , at the u.n. , everywhere .
and what happens at the end ?
people ask me , what special is in my mentorship which has made malala so bold and so courageous and so vocal and poised ?
now this is a debate that has generated a lot of emotion and angry rhetoric .
and , in places where there are worms , intestinal worms , cure the kids of their worms .
so that was my office in iit . here &apos;s the hole-in-the-wall .
so it sort of raised more questions than it answered .
so in february of 2009 , dr. zullinger invited us , project h design — which is a non-profit design firm that i founded — to come to bertie and to partner with him on the repair of this school district and to bring a design perspective to the repair of the school district .
it &apos;s working-class ; it &apos;s blue-collar .
hi . for those of you who haven &apos;t seen dancing bears , these are the dancing bears .
and we said , &quot; &quot; okay , here is some seed fund .
he &apos;s even more valuable because he can take on various roles , depending on his clients &apos; needs .
now , let &apos;s say that you are , in your heart , a specialist .
hazrat ali : they first call us to the mosque and preach to us .
effectively , this is the brainwashing process that has begun .
so just think of this : you have a grid of neurons , and now you have a plane mechanical change in the position of the grid , and you get a warping of your mental experience .
it &apos;s the following .
i looked but didn &apos;t see .
if and when your anger turns to hate , please know that there is no space for that in our shared home .
and it &apos;s better than that , it — just in the slide — maneuvers in mid-air .
and watch it now slip , and see what it does with its tail .
this is happening by itself .
the computer revolution , the technocratic , technological revolution , has allowed us to jettison normal-shaped buildings , traditionally shaped buildings , in favor of non-orthogonal buildings such as this .
that &apos;s where the concept of ruling with an iron fist comes from .
not next week , not next month , maybe in november , but maybe 10,000 years after that .
the reason many people think that about this picture , and al gore has said it many times , actually , on the stage at ted , is that this picture , arguably , was the beginning of the environmental movement .
this is actually a picture of the spectrum of the sun .
they have the fastest women on earth .
measurement .
i have worked with more than 500 companies .
the real battle is not against competitors .
and then renovating smaller chillers instead of adding bigger ones saved 17 million dollars of capital cost , which helped pay for the other improvements and reduce the payback to just three years .
now our team at rmi helps smart companies to get unstuck and speed this journey via six sectoral initiatives , with some more hatching .
adam i asks how things work .
soloveitchik said there are two sides of our natures , which he called adam i and adam ii .
she &apos;s a self-identified tomboy .
i &apos;m talking about cowboy boots and caterpillar yellow toy trucks and bug jars , the whole nine yards .
you have a genotype and you have to have a phenotype .
&quot; ibm machine putting a tar-like substance on the cards . the tar is from the roof . &quot;
no , it didn &apos;t .
eventually , after a period of six months of brutal war and a toll rate of almost 50,000 dead , we managed to liberate our country and to topple the tyrant .
and with all sincerity , i can say , i am glad i lived those two years of my life that way , because my goal to not suffer regrets anymore , i got there with that goal .
how had i spent my valuable time ?
i mean , that &apos;s a great design .
we need to start doing things like lula , president of brazil .
instances of prominent social and political figures in polygamous relationships has led to the perception of polygamy as a symbol of wealth , status and power .
he &apos;s most often paid for his services in cash , cows or goats .
it is about the state of the planet .
we depend on water , forests , deserts , oceans .
here we &apos;re starting with just a picture of clouds , and as we optimize , basically , this network is figuring out what it sees in the clouds .
but you start to get something more like a coherent face , rendered using my own face as a guide .
but you see , when a city is only being created , it &apos;s very easy to incorporate this kind of infrastructure .
in the united states , for example , more than 70 million new homes must be built over the next 40 or 50 years .
get involved with your community .
( applause ) pm : and you &apos;re doing that even though your recovery has to remain front and center for both of you .
but then i took the pieces that i had taken off and put them at the bottom .
but i was absolutely stuck on the idea of &quot; &quot; art is &quot; &quot; and trying to determine what art was .
you might wanna avert your gaze , because that is a newt about to regenerate its limb , and shaking hands spreads more germs than kissing .
everybody gets heard .
so , that was government data .
how can you use this stuff ?
you know , they made drugs to give the pilots if they were broken up in the process .
i &apos;m going to do it carefully , but i &apos;ll do it .
a far more effective way to create forms , i have found , is to use information that is already contained in forms .
and because i &apos;ve designed the process and not the form , i can run the process again and again and again to produce a whole family of forms .
&quot; mommy , i know you have been stopped . &quot;
&quot; are you kidding me ? &quot;
and there &apos;s some things you just don &apos;t need to have in songs .
( laughter ) i &apos;m not going to hurt you . don &apos;t worry .
it allows the person to switch , and to mix these two colorations .
but when nicholas negroponte — and he has spoken about this project a lot , he &apos;s the founder of olpc — came to us about two and a half years ago , there were some clear ideas .
i wanted to visualize the story of life .
so who are we ? brothers of masculine chimps , sisters of feminine bonobos ? we are all of them , and more .
and i said , &quot; &quot; huh . there are millions of americans on those two drugs . &quot; &quot; in fact , we learned later , 15 million americans on paroxetine at the time , 15 million on pravastatin , and a million , we estimated , on both .
and lo and behold , glucose went up 20 to 60 milligrams per deciliter in the mice .
this next project , this is by jaochim parisvega , and he &apos;s interested in — he believes art is everywhere waiting — that it just needs a little bit of a push to happen .
i figured out their bios , their passions in life and their art styles , and i started making their work .
when they &apos;re out of education , they do it on a computer .
so what &apos;s the problem , why has this chasm opened up , and what can we do to fix it ?
this is something that perhaps turkish airlines should have studied a bit more carefully before they ran this campaign .
so to explain that — if you &apos;ve got an elementary particle and you shine a light on it , then the photon of light has momentum , which knocks the particle , so you don &apos;t know where it was before you looked at it .
where is this going ?
and despite that , a scot and a brazilian persevered , because that &apos;s how we were raised in our respective countries , and for 12 , 15 years , we made demonstration after demonstration suggesting that this was possible .
and so i jumped in , i jumped into this world of technology , to see how i could use it to enable magic as opposed to kill it .
another thing that &apos;s actually really important to me is creating content that is indian and yet very contemporary .
the first day they would take a hike , and it was , click , click , click , click . five minutes later they were back in the boat .
but what i &apos;d like to talk about today is what life might teach us in technology and in design .
accelerometers on each hand read hand position .
but mostly ...
so i take a deep breath and i look down and staring back at me is a four-year-old girl in a pink dress , not a challenge to a feminist duel , just a kid with a question : &quot; are you a boy or are you a girl ? &quot;
the only story that matters is the one that you want to write .
no more years of the cup .
let me tell you one more story .
and by doing that , he &apos;s interfering with the activity of this brain region for about half an hour .
so why is that ?
when i was growing up , my heroes were people like fred astaire , gene kelly , michael jackson .
it &apos;s kind of like this other level where you can &apos;t make choices anymore , and it &apos;s just your body reacting to certain sounds in the music .
at elam , students worked round the clock to contact 2,000 graduates .
take the garífuna grads .
&quot; &quot; there is a hero in all of us , &quot; &quot; is their slogan .
we wanted to ask members of the public to help us come up with a policy , not after the fact , commenting on a rule after it &apos;s written , the way is typically the case , but in advance . there was no legal precedent , no cultural precedent , no technical way of doing this .
i &apos;m pretty sure that i &apos;m grown now .
( applause ) thank you .
that &apos;s something that no tv channel could ever do .
we were covering more than 50 cities at the same time .
i don &apos;t know the people who wrote all the books and articles that i read in preparation for this talk .
( laughter ) and what do corporations do all day ?
i &apos;m here to tell you the story of audur capital , which is a financial firm founded by me and kristin — who you see in the picture — in the spring of 2007 , just over a year before the economic collapse hit .
the final thought i want to leave with you is that i &apos;m fed up with this tyranny of either / or choices in life — either it &apos;s men or it &apos;s women .
it was intolerable .
the basic problem , i &apos;m sure you &apos;re familiar with , that you &apos;re looking inside a long , narrow , dark place .
but in the past few months , researchers have also isolated several new broadly neutralizing antibodies from the blood of an hiv infected individual .
it was easily transmitted , but , luckily , was pretty mild .
i toured the world as a headliner on arabs gone wild .
i have always loved the fact that my hood and my affliction share the same initials .
and he is worthy of an entire talk on his own right .
the value of education is something that froebel championed , through plastic modes of play .
thank you .
i was never as kind as my dad , and i was never as loving .
but when i came back to it , i had all sorts of new ideas .
why was i so wrong ?
they will float in seawater , but unfortunately do not get recycled under the bottle bills .
and this .
we &apos;re going to demonstrate this to you now by disabling one of its halves .
what can you do with all this surplus ?
a lot of our friends thought we were absolutely stupid to do that and that we were going to come back and all the pictures on the wall would be removed and graf on the walls .
this is a cheap pair of sunglasses that we bought at the venice beach boardwalk , some copper wire and some stuff from home depot and radio shack .
i &apos;m not expected to — i understand my social context .
and then one last thing : there &apos;s one component more that &apos;s required to work swarmwise that i haven &apos;t mentioned yet .
this is how we have to move the bits around to actually get the people the answers to their questions .
and so i guess the u.s. finally , finally started to like it , too .
a son and his father are in a horrible car accident .
( applause ) because ladies and gentlemen , that &apos;s my day job .
and there &apos;s a whole range of compounds that they do use .
and we found some remarkable differences .
i like doing new things and making new things happen .
all this , before it ever got near a computer .
we do not need everything that is there . &quot; &quot; a sociologist from the warsaw survey agency explained , &quot; &quot; the older generation jumped from nothing to choice all around them .
it &apos;s called &quot; &quot; being true to yourself . &quot; &quot; but do all individuals benefit from taking such an approach to choice ?
and i decided that i had compromised , just like my friends in those discussions , where we told stories in contexts we made excuses for , rather than taking responsibility for .
this man was very drunk , and he was very interested in my camera , until he noticed the women , who handled him with smiles , and ak-47s at the ready , of course .
i started doing some research then , and this was the 25-year journey , and started finding out that actually human beings as primates have far smaller stomachs than should be the size for our body weight and far larger brains .
you bring it all together and mash it up and the value emerges that way .
yves uses his body to steer the wing .
yr : first , to instruct a younger guy .
no more do we have these simplified predator-versus-prey diagrams we have all learned at school .
and it actually maps out all domains of knowledge as separate branches of a tree .
( music ) ( applause )
we are so honored to be here at tedwomen , sharing our music with you .
think about artists , not as content providers , though they can be brilliant at that , but , again , as real catalysts .
my overall project is about art — specifically , about black artists — very generally about the way in which art can change the way we think about culture and ourselves .
now , diabetes is one of the big ones .
and then the great fortune of meeting up with gary and mary west , to get behind this wireless health institute .
i &apos;ve even been called &quot; &quot; the isis of the obesity epidemic &quot; &quot; — ( laughter ) a comment so absurd that it is funny .
not the lowercase , muttered-behind-my-back kind , or the seemingly harmless chubby or cuddly .
rm : it &apos;s a distinct symbol of chicago pride .
vexillological .
when i use my camera , i drop my skin like the animals at that cave so i can show who they really are .
you may wonder , do i ever photograph people ?
go backwards .
this actually shows the actual printer .
but as it turns out , we know a lot more about space than we do about the underground waterways coursing through our planet , the very lifeblood of mother earth .
they have no pigment and no eyes in many cases , and these animals are also extremely long-lived .
they do not perceive their environment using sound , and these are the flying foxes .
think of a mouse . but bats are very different .
whoa .
ds : now — ( applause ) — thanks .
intimacy for us means a lot of different things .
the original intention of this space , which was unfortunately never realized , was to use lenticular glass which allowed only a kind of perpendicular view out .
but we shouldn &apos;t be so critical of our scientists for a simple reason : they didn &apos;t have much time .
and we produce this mountain every year .
i mean , i showed you a computer model , but a computer is not understanding .
i &apos;m a mathematician . we would like to be able to understand better .
and the dark ages are the time between when you put away the lego for the last time as a kid , and you decide as an adult that it is okay to play with a kid &apos;s toy .
okay . anyway .
and then this incredible thing happened .
and then finally , to an underwater museum , with over 500 living sculptures .
well , that &apos;s exactly what i want to talk about today , is how we can use these natural forces to remediate these man-made problems .
so what we are doing is an accelerated evolution of sailing technology .
i &apos;m saying that the capacity for self-transcendence is just a basic part of being human .
we unleashed earth-changing creativity and generated vast wealth and comfort .
sometimes you just can &apos;t conceive otherwise .
it means you can have twins born — oh , in 50 years ?
audience : wow .
it &apos;s a very beautiful structure .
sleep is absolutely crucial for recovery .
in fact , 65 decibels is the very level at which this big survey of all the evidence on noise and health found that , that is the threshold for the danger of myocardial infarction .
when someone hands an object to you , you can read intention in their eyes , their face , their body language .
the perfect robot will be indistinguishable from the human , and that scares us .
&quot; hear what ? there ain &apos;t nothing . no , really — there ain &apos;t no bat ! &quot;
( drum roll ) tonight , like most nights , i &apos;m all alone .
millions and millions of people were accustomed to the old design .
the button had kind of gotten out of sync with the evolution of our brand and it needed to be modernized .
but sometimes we speak up when we shouldn &apos;t , and i learned that over 10 years ago when i let my twin brother down .
can i confront my coworker who keeps stepping on my toes ?
now the reason the chimpanzees don &apos;t do that is that they lack what psychologists and anthropologists call social learning .
social learning really is visual theft .
maybe you &apos;re a mediocre earner but a masterful father .
it felt like a provocation .
i knew robots like that didn &apos;t really exist , but i knew i wanted to build them .
can you find cookie monster ?
so we could either take something long and make it a topic , like with the railway and the hurtigruten , or we could take a topic and make it long .
even the elections this past week passed without much drama .
how do we enter that feeling of resonance , how do we enter another person &apos;s being ?
these are survival skills .
and to her , that spoke of a kind of attentiveness that she needed .
this is not a reputation you would wish on your worst enemy .
basically , we follow a low-frequency behavior — one the dog doesn &apos;t want to do — by a high-frequency behavior , commonly known as a behavior problem , or a dog hobby — something the dog does like to do .
not just with their puppy , but with the rest of the family at class .
i was in high school and got a bad grade , a rare event for me , so i decided to hide it from my parents .
his parents were jewish , russian and above all , very poor .
that &apos;s what spreads hiv . &quot; &quot; this was a headline in a u.k. newspaper , the guardian , not that long ago .
but those ways of being rational are not independent of one another , so it &apos;s rational for a drug injector to share needles because of a stupid decision that &apos;s made by a politician , and it &apos;s rational for a politician to make that stupid decision because they &apos;re responding to what they think the voters want .
this is a tri-star , and so they let natasha actually sit in the jump seat .
i used to be a photographer for many years .
( applause )
the kids at my school opened it without my permission .
the brain now a world that we can fly through and interact with .
our researchers are interacting with this data by injecting bacterial code , which are computer programs , that allow these creatures to grow over time .
one of those things you just saw flashed before you was a raven drone , the handheld tossed one . for about a thousand dollars , you can build one yourself , equivalent to what the soldiers use in iraq .
what is the message that we think we are sending with these machines versus what is being received in terms of the message .
what you get out of that is not smiley-ness .
in two of the three great arenas of life , by the time len was 30 , len was enormously successful .
i love the idea that people will sit in one room for a couple of hours and listen .
because , if you look closely enough , things will begin to appear .
they made sure to write &quot; &quot; michelle obama &quot; &quot; in the caption and they made sure to upload the picture as &quot; &quot; michelleobama.jpeg , &quot; &quot; or the like .
it &apos;s not true .
and have to do something with it . &quot; &quot; hundreds of remixes came back — lots of different attempts .
and that &apos;s not always going to happen in physical spaces .
( laughter ) i would soon find out that there was a high price to pay for my freedom , and for questioning the patriarchy .
but i was happy to pay it , because for every blow that i received , i was able to deliver two .
so , we had the goal and we had the issues , and now we needed to figure out what the solutions were .
so basically , with that phone call , i promised to help a state and system which was as large as that of peru or canada transform itself .
it can be music , it can be opera , it can be a theater piece , it can be film , it can be video dance .
the audience and the performer make the piece together .
so you have an image , a retina , and a brain .
so a completely blind retina , even one with no front-end circuitry at all , no photoreceptors , can now send out normal signals , signals that the brain can understand .
she looks terrified .
so there you go . that &apos;s the truth .
these massifs enchanted me from the first time i saw them .
what you can find there is really evidence of a lost world .
listen , my lab is not in the ear-manufacturing business .
this is the point when people started asking me , &quot; andrew , can you make body parts out of apples ? &quot;
although i worked very long hours , i lived in a penthouse in union square .
the second thing is a bigger lesson about the world today .
she tried , she came close , but she didn &apos;t get it exactly right .
i raised money from everyone i knew , including indian aunties that were just so happy an indian girl was running .
the glacier &apos;s gone all the way up the mountain and left in its place this big lake .
this is the time to swim with real humility .
unlike their creative brothers and sisters , who are sculptors or photographers or filmmakers or musicians , fashion designers can sample from all their peers &apos; designs .
he has complained a lot about people copying him , but in one interview i read , he said it has really forced him to up his game .
our community deserved a new way of doing things .
but i really needed a support network , a group of people who were going to help me make sure that i wasn &apos;t going to be a victim of my own circumstance , that they were going to push me beyond what i even thought i could do .
what was , for me , a very naive observation , turned out to be a disaster .
i loved it . i thought there was something really beautiful about that .
it &apos;s something that is totally out of the bell curve .
and the night before , we camped , and my tibetan friends said , &quot; we are going to sleep outside . &quot;
next to him is john mccrea , who was an inker for spiderman .
i worry because all around me , even within my extended family , i see religion being manipulated .
deep inside any of these particles , there is something else .
and there you see unification , because matter particles , electrons and quarks , radiation particles , photons , gravitons , are all built up from one entity .
and now , a few years later , i &apos;ve led several expeditions to the ultimate far-flung corner on this planet , the sahara .
and so after 100 years we finally had another partial skeleton of this bizarre creature .
and we &apos;ve been getting a lot of takers . one is the rock &apos; n &apos; rollers .
i think we can one-up the greeks and achieve something .
( applause )
we have lots of other really interesting demographic information as well .
some brands are aspirational , and certainly the packaging is incredibly provocative .
and for donor agencies , unfortunately , the audience tends to be people that aren &apos;t even in the country they &apos;re working &#91; in &#93; .
it was dying well before he did , and now it &apos;s on its last legs .
the united states , at this point , was putting pressure on all its arab allies , including tunisia , to stamp out extremism in their societies , and this imam found himself suddenly in the crosshairs of the tunisian intelligence service .
it had a driver and a passenger , and after the car had passed the judge by , the passenger extended his hand , pointed it back to the judge as the car continued on , just as the teenagers had described it , right ?
it was those two considerations , among others — reconstructed memory , the fact about the eyewitness fallibility — that was part of the instigation for a group of appeal attorneys led by an amazing lawyer named ellen eggers to pool their experience and their talents together and petition a superior court for a retrial for francisco carrillo .
that is a huge challenge .
this is an old climate model , admittedly , a punch card , a single line of fortran code .
they are now buying cars .
and their aspiration was to buy a car .
but , if i had something like a ted wish , it would be to actually get it built , to start building this habitable wall , this very , very long , but very narrow city in the desert , built into the dunescape itself .
so , how much would this cost ?
in addition , the regime was dependent on the loans from the west .
he didn &apos;t want to wait until somebody tried to act against the regime .
they kind of bombard us and equip our mind with a lot of strange ideas , and on top of it we put the very thing that makes us humans , our human intuition .
everything is getting worse .
and i have several dictionaries in my own studio , and i do use a computer every day , and if i need to look up a word , i &apos;ll go on the computer , because i can go directly and instantly to what i &apos;m looking up .
so i think of the book as a body , and i think of the book as a technology .
the first test of penicillin , the first antibiotic , was three years in the future .
when we first made antibiotics , we took those compounds into the lab and made our own versions of them , and bacteria responded to our attack the way they always had .
and i said , &quot; &quot; what &apos;s the plan , dan ?
i said , &quot; &quot; but what was all the &apos; three weeks until , &apos; &apos; two weeks until &apos; emails ?
i remember having to use vodka — my own vodka — to pickle it because we don &apos;t carry formaldehyde .
( laughter ) you know , it &apos;s just ludicrous .
100 years later .
well , within a year this thing had taken off .
jenipher answered a few questions on her phone and she gave us access to a few key data points on her device .
jenipher is 65 years old , and for decades has been running a food stall in the central business district .
but for us , the rain is good .
i had luck . i was lucky , because this is a fact of life when you grow up in a place like that .
think about that for a minute .
and i say to you , i might not stick to this , but i don &apos;t think i &apos;ll ever serve foie gras on my menu again because of that taste experience with eduardo .
one of the most exciting things about this is that , indeed , it involves multidisciplinary work .
you see the electrode going through the skull into the brain and resting there , and we can place this really anywhere in the brain .
i &apos;d love to tell you that i didn &apos;t flinch , but i was terrified , and when my fear subsided , i became obsessed with finding out how this happened , how animal rights and environmental activists who have never injured anyone could become the fbi &apos;s number one domestic terrorism threat .
these are everyday people , like these protesters in italy who spontaneously climbed over barbed wire fences to rescue beagles from animal testing .
i see you &apos;re all up on the history of hurdy-gurdy — &quot; vielle à roue . &quot;
when i turn the crank and i apply pressure , it makes a sound like a barking dog .
( laughter ) so let me tell you about a hollywood party i went to a couple years back , and i met this up-and-coming actress , and we were soon talking about something that we both felt passionately about : public art .
and as she was talking , a thought came to my mind .
we then started growing these channels on the human body , varying material properties according to the desired functionality .
we were ready to receive the caterpillars .
somi .
red circle .
it &apos;s a perfect world .
i wanted to make it bigger .
the rule is going to be this .
don &apos;t plan for the war unless you plan to win the peace .
we created the first parking-protected bike lane in the united states .
in the past , it looked like the guy on the left , ninja-clad bike messenger .
who &apos;s advantaged in this new world and who isn &apos;t ?
but the next generation is going to be so much better and so much faster .
and we need to diversify our farms .
so there &apos;s other , maybe more personal reasons , to care about bees .
and we will have to extract uranium from sea water , which is the yellow line , to make conventional nuclear power stations actually do very much for us .
and with current reactor technology we really don &apos;t have very much uranium .
so what really launched modern neuroscience was a stain called the golgi stain .
and that &apos;s because today we can see what &apos;s inside of the brain , rather than just looking at its overall shape .
and unfortunately , the stats — they tell the same story .
it was a strange choice , and it was super crunchy .
but worse than that , it is causing hunger , poverty , violence , social breakdown and war , and as i am talking to you , millions of men , women and children are suffering and dying .
the most massive tsunami perfect storm is bearing down upon us .
she had gotten better , and not coincidentally , veronica &apos;s home was better too .
&quot; &quot; veronica , can you tell me about where you live ?
( laughter ) and we don &apos;t like them made of plastic , in the same way i don &apos;t really like my phone very much — it &apos;s not how i want to experience information .
i &apos;d like to start by asking you all to go to your happy place , please .
and as it turns out , it actually corresponds really nicely with geologic history .
at the bottom of the cliff , we find that they &apos;re rare as hens &apos; teeth .
or is it because we have now started labeling individuals with autism , simply giving them a diagnosis when they were still present there before yet simply didn &apos;t have that label ?
and one of the things i &apos;m going to spend a lot of time focusing on are the genes that can cause autism .
but you have to maintain it .
i see young people and they want to work , but they &apos;re in this thing where they &apos;re caught up — i see kids of color and they &apos;re just on this track that &apos;s designed for them , that leads them to nowhere .
( applause )
i think of it as sort of a cathedral .
from nothing to thing .
and the reason for doing so , at the center of this photograph , is linus pauling . about six months before , he proposed the alpha helical structure for proteins . and in doing so , he banished the man out on the right , sir lawrence bragg , who was the cavendish professor .
there &apos;s definitely hunger in america : 49 million people and almost 16.7 million children .
and when you think about food , the underpinning of food in both cases is potentially problematic agriculture .
by changing the message , we were able to provide an alternative narrative which promoted the rights of women in libya .
i &apos;ve heard everything from , &quot; &quot; your parents must be extremely ashamed of you &quot; &quot; — false ; they &apos;re my biggest fans — to &quot; &quot; you will not make it to your next birthday &quot; &quot; — again wrong , because i did .
we did that genetically and we did that anatomically .
and this one &apos;s particularly well-suited to the dive configuration , so when you &apos;re deeper under the water .
but when we figure it out , we &apos;ll have a better handle on life itself .
sanitation ? no .
so , what your letter means : i &apos;ve got to tell you , we are all in a party , and political officials are the pinatas .
and there are two things that are primary in a politician &apos;s heart : one is reputation and influence .
so we paid attention to a particular grammatical rule , past-tense conjugation .
and i think that mathematics will be a very powerful language to do that .
and it &apos;s not unique to us .
we were there with mit and uc berkeley engineers .
at : well , i &apos;ve been telling this story every year .
and so this is what we have .
it &apos;s like a wall to the electricity .
we have two favorite recipes — one that has these ingredients and a second that had sugar instead of salt .
now , it &apos;s no secret , because i like collecting things , that i love the natural history museum and the collections of animals at the natural history museum in dioramas .
you know , just like people on the street when you get too close to them .
( applause )
today , we started by talking about the boundary , but if we remove this boundary , the only boundary left is our imagination .
( applause )
they had been pushed genetically .
we see alien worlds , we see alien solar systems — 300 now , and still counting — and they &apos;re not like us .
and in telling stories , each of us is going to understand the universe in our own way .
now , using a cutting-edge piece of technology that &apos;s not really meant for the oceans is not always easy .
quite literally right there i am skyping in the classroom with one of the six continents and some of the 70,000 students that we connected every single day to some of these experiences .
that &apos;s 500 calories out of a total of 2,000 calories , just to keep your brain working .
and this is where the story started to bother me .
think about it : in 2013 , the second decade of the millennium , if you &apos;re concerned about a cancer diagnosis and you go to your doctor , you get bone scans , biopsies and blood tests .
what we need to do is to use our ingenuity and our scientific knowledge to try to design a new generation of treatments that are targeted to specific neurons and specific regions of the brain that are affected in particular psychiatric disorders .
turn it just a bit .
in fact , it &apos;s probably not going to stop until this computer disintegrates .
so here &apos;s my friend scott &apos;s screen shot .
and along came the internet and it swept them out of the way , and it allowed all of us to connect together , and it was awesome .
( applause ) bruno giussani : vincent , vincent , vincent .
the sufi rituals of chechnya to a mass in the holiest church of armenia .
( music ) how about that ?
it says right now , we think music is notes and how they &apos;re played .
now here &apos;s the kicker .
you &apos;d totally be surprised .
you have to train to be able to do that .
at first , the argentine government said , &quot; &quot; no , there &apos;s no way .
but still i think in combination these events are pushing us further towards an acceptance of human genetic modification .
what is the right path forward with human genetic modification ?
these are my buildings .
now obviously , every time i bring this up , people even , you know , here at the conference , say , &quot; are you serious ? thirty stories ? how &apos;s that going to happen ? &quot;
the money piece , yeah .
but we need to separate our discomfort about talking about poo and pee so we can calmly talk about how we want to reuse it and what things we don &apos;t want to reuse .
they make sounds 10 times as high and hear sounds 10 times as high as we do .
( laughter ) so dolphins are also political animals , so they have to resolve conflicts .
that pencil-yellow crank was remembered by everybody .
and so i went to each of those countries at least six times , met with the head of state probably two or three times .
and it happens in real life all the time .
you &apos;re from fargo , north dakota . let me see what comes up .
they &apos;ve pioneered a different approach to villages .
he &apos;s a leaders &apos; quest fellow , and that helps him with his work .
and we have found that the organic compounds coming from this moon are in fact more complex than we previously reported .
whether or not there are living organisms there , of course , is an entirely different matter .
and we can then apply mechanical forces to the chip that stretch and contract the membrane , so the cells experience the same mechanical forces that they did when we breathe .
this could really revolutionize and be a game changer for not only the pharmaceutical industry , but a whole host of different industries , including the cosmetics industry .
and then you add the owner of the company .
this truly is a scandal of epic proportions hidden in plain sight .
here &apos;s your brute force approach . once you get through your brute force approach , then you just rip off whole mountaintops . and you end up with the single largest source of carbon emissions , which are coal-fired gas plants . that is probably not the best use of bioenergy .
you &apos;re going to be able to power stuff , so irrigation makes a difference .
i mean , come on . is photography awesome ?
but it &apos;s not like a flower can just get up and have sex with another flower , although that would be awesome .
the link to cave paintings takes me to some of the oldest art known to humankind .
common themes around the globe include large wild animals and tracings of human hands , usually the left hand .
but you know what ? you don &apos;t have to take my word for it .
these laws ensure that people living with hiv and those at greatest risk are protected from violence and discrimination and that they get access to prevention and to treatment .
now , while i &apos;ll let it circulate for a little more , let me tell you a little bit about superconductors .
well , let me answer this simple question by giving you an example .
the one up there can &apos;t divide at all .
novocure conducted its first phase three randomized trial in patients with recurrent gbm .
and black men see their barbers about every two weeks .
but herein lies the problem .
the first again , is making ideas clear by visualizing them .
so this year we &apos;re going to visualize how the brain visualizes .
and today the whole pacific ocean has traces of contamination of cesium-137 .
so we &apos;ve transformed our tiny hong kong classroom into a workshop .
so we didn &apos;t have peak fish yet .
this red line is continuing to go down .
the density of the brain is incredible .
as you can see here , we &apos;ve color-coded all the biomolecules brown .
well , heart cells are pretty greedy .
and we feed them — sterilely of course — with what we call cell culture media — which is like their food — and we grow them in incubators .
a clicker , which makes a particular sound with which you can reinforce particular behaviors .
and if , however , you are detected very early , diagnosed early , treatment can start , and even in hiv-positives , it makes sense .
so as more and more of our lives become digital , we are fighting a losing battle trying to curb our usage of devices in order to reclaim our emotions .
and by humanizing technology , we have this golden opportunity to reimagine how we connect with machines , and therefore , how we , as human beings , connect with one another .
so the parasite is a very big scientific challenge to tackle , but so is the mosquito that carries the parasite .
imagine , for example , if a bunch of well-meaning kenyans came up to those of us in the temperate world and said , &quot; &quot; you know , you people have a lot of cold and flu .
a project which is part of an exhibition in copenhagen 10 years ago , which was the modeling of a hippocampus — the territory of the brain that records short-term memory — and the documentation of that , the imaginative and documentation of that through a series of drawings which literally attempt to organize that experience .
but we took the air conditioning out of the tower .
and this is not an idealized version . these are working models that at least in some places in the united states are being implemented , at least for public security .
it is the critical long-term shift caused by the internet .
uber and didi are early but powerful examples of how technology is creating trust between people in ways and on a scale never possible before .
the second level is about having confidence in the platform , that blablacar will help you if something goes wrong .
it basically tells us this is the distribution of planets in size .
but we learn a lot from that : not only that there is a planet there , but we also learn its size .
that &apos;s true of european biofuels .
let &apos;s say they do 30 miles per gallon .
it really does look like mars in certain locations and has been used by nasa to test equipment .
we did all kinds of research .
who raised it , and what did it eat ?
we could all become vegan .
i &apos;ve got two kids i mentioned , sawyer and avery .
i have to admit something to you .
when i see objects , i imagine them in motion .
( laughter ) and i started to make him walk across the table , and i thought , &quot; &quot; oh , i can make a little machine that will do that . &quot; &quot; so , i made this device , linked it up , and the wishbone walks .
but in evolution , cooperation — though competition exists , of course — cooperation has to be much more creative to go to increased levels of complexity .
they have not been trained .
( laughter ) the whole world was laid out for me .
so long as the sun shines , we &apos;ll have no problem with power .
so with very little effort , you will be able to learn a couple hundred characters , which is the same as a chinese eight-year-old .
over the past few years , i &apos;ve been wondering if i can break down this wall , so anyone who wants to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language could do so .
so please be period positive .
many of the volunteers took this prototype themselves to educate girls and take menstrual awareness workshops in five different states in india .
and we explored the surface of the islands as well — very important bird nesting site , some of the most important bird-nesting sites in the pacific , in the world .
but if you come , you have to buy lunch for everybody who comes to the seminar . &quot; &quot; so i said , &quot; &quot; okay , i &apos;m happy to buy lunch .
so every time i fail to become more like my father , i become more like myself .
hp : don &apos;t imitate my voice .
although we don &apos;t have statistics for warfare throughout the middle ages to modern times , we know just from conventional history — the evidence was under our nose all along that there has been a reduction in socially sanctioned forms of violence .
thank you very much .
so some people hear that statistic and they ask , why do we have so few women leaders ?
so some of you might be some of those women who are in middle management and seeking to move up in your organization .
at the same time , the objects i study are producing some of the most powerful particle streams ever observed .
( laughter ) these two characteristics , with a few others , make them quasars .
still terrible .
so where are we ?
( applause )
but at that point , i would probably already have the lowest possible mortgage and the most enlarged possible penis ( laughter ) — so i would outlaw spam on my first day in office .
it could be that on one day , the colony is split between two boxes , but on another day , it could be together in a single box , or split between three or more boxes , and that all seems rather erratic , really .
in fact , the dominant female is extremely important for the cohesion of the group .
what are the principles that we should adopt in order to avoid repeating the same mistakes ?
syria was largely a place of tolerance , historically accustomed to variety , accommodating a wide range of beliefs , origins , customs , goods , food .
so — ( laughter ) it bugs me , and i know i should do something about it .
and this one is really good .
it looks as though he &apos;s wishing that he didn &apos;t win .
that experience confirms that , in spite of all your limitations — all your wants , desires , unfulfilled , and the credit cards and layoffs and , finally , baldness — you can be happy .
this film also speaks to the iranian people in asking them to return to their history and look at themselves before they were so islamicized — in the way we looked , in the way we played music , in the way we had intellectual life .
that , under all circumstances , they have pushed the boundary .
you &apos;ve read about how the new economy is changing the roles of caregiver and wage earner .
but they do send a message to boys , that they are not , the boys are not really the target audience .
and he played his bluegrass style of music , but near the end of the concert , he played the old timing style of banjo picking that came from africa , along with the banjo .
down below , there was her grandson plowing the tobacco field with a mule .
and finally , you profile this , you cut grooves into it .
and again , the way in which that works as a building , for those of us who can enjoy the spaces , to live and visit there .
they are impossible to juggle . &quot; &quot; tenacity is how i kept at it against all odds .
i was pretty fast , but i was not fluid at all .
this is a tiny little signal , so how do i detect it ?
so that means as an engineer , depending on how big or small i make a material , i can change where it goes in your body .
and once that happened , they were out in the city convincing everybody that child labor just had to be abolished .
are you ready , ladies and gentlemen ? audience : yes !
they &apos;ve eaten together . they &apos;ve bled together .
this is clay hunt . clay was a marine with me .
we needed to take what we had built and create a platform out of it so that it could be used elsewhere in the world .
if it works in africa then it will work anywhere .
genome engineering is actually not new , it &apos;s been in development since the 1970s .
it &apos;s interesting that as i talk to people , my scientific colleagues as well as others , there &apos;s a wide variety of viewpoints about this .
so on this tour , i hope i provided you with a new perspective of the high seas : one , that it is our home too , and that we need to work together if we are to make this a sustainable ocean future for us all .
with an average depth of the oceans of 4,000 meters , in fact , the high seas covers and provides nearly 90 percent of the habitat for life on this earth .
the whole world , at 1.2 trillion estimated reserves , only gives us about 45 years .
i started my journey 30 years ago .
because no one &apos;s really watching .
and then sometimes you get this .
we know what happens to the kids who experience that life .
so one reason is obviously economic or structural .
they &apos;re both shrinking and retreating — and some of them have disappeared altogether .
( laughter ) because there seems to be an issue .
this is not a new idea .
my greatest fear is that the eurozone will not survive .
you just have to know where to look , and to maybe be a little thin .
so this is a new species we described , from southern indiana .
the first thing that i learned was that we need to change our mindset .
i &apos;d like to leave you with three lessons that i learned .
environmentally , meat , amazingly , causes more emissions than all of transportation combined : cars , trains , planes , buses , boats , all of it .
and i thought about it , and i came up with one .
as you can see in blue , huge areas of our world are barely seen , less than once a year , and even the areas that are seen most frequently , those in red , are seen at best once a quarter .
now people use these because they get a lot of light , which means less of the noise you see in a low-cost cell phone image .
and to make them really stereotypical , let &apos;s make them both white guys .
the thing to keep in mind is that this is absolutely great news .
so i thought , well , maybe i should teach a course on ignorance , something i can finally excel at , perhaps , for example .
and secondly , how the hell can we tell the difference between two molecules that differ by a single carbon atom ?
so to combat this , we tether ourselves with science .
this is the moment that i live for in lighting .
and we did . and he said , &quot; &quot; right . now we &apos;re all connected . &quot; &quot; and as we held on , and we breathed as one , we knew we weren &apos;t on this journey alone .
but then the doctor came over to me , and she said , &quot; &quot; janine , the operation was a success , and we &apos;ve picked as much bone out of your spinal cord as we could , but the damage is permanent .
the problem , put in its simplest terms , is one of mathematics .
i mean , frankly , i need all of you to think about how you can help solve this huge issue .
but i think there &apos;s something else going on .
you didn &apos;t even need to be a billionaire to get on that list in 1992 .
the foundation i started along with the book &quot; &quot; lean in &quot; &quot; helps women , or men , start circles — small groups , it can be 10 , it can be however many you want , which meet once a month .
pm : have you been surprised by the global nature of the message ?
we have to make it immediately .
what is the cost of that battery ?
( laughter ) sort of .
( laughter ) ... these dosages have something to do with it .
but it &apos;s not an easy road . after the bomb , the victims are not into this .
there &apos;s 625 of us in this room . we &apos;re going to be scarred for life .
so it would work as well , for example , in a power plant or in an automobile factory .
and as a matter of fact , this fake input data is actually prerecorded by stuxnet .
pushed by my own experience , as i was not allowed initially to pursue my higher education , i decided to explore and document stories of other women who changed their lives through education , while exposing and questioning the barriers they face .
these issues include female illiteracy , which is quite high in the region ; educational reforms ; programs for dropout students ; and political activism among university students .
and he smiled , and he said , &quot; &quot; good . you never know .
in most parts of the us , the baseline expectation in public is that we maintain a balance between civility and privacy .
if you &apos;re on the way to visit your mother in-law , you &apos;d probably prefer to stay on the left .
( laughter ) ( applause ) choose your frame of reference and the perceived value and therefore the actual value is completely tranformed .
many of you have probably already noticed that i &apos;m chinese .
and just in summary , no matter how far i push this , i can &apos;t get it to break .
this is the opera house that wagner built for himself .
it actually improves it .
( music ) this one you should be — confidence . jesus survives . don &apos;t worry . ( music )
you &apos;re every step i make ...
a thousand years into this period , we abandon our hunting and gathering patterns .
we may , in fact , have entered a new geological era — the anthropocene , where humans are the predominant driver of change at a planetary level .
the restaurant business in seattle ? booming .
my friends and i , we own a bank .
we should be able to be dealing with these things at this level , and these conclusions say that growth and malignant behavior is regulated at the level of tissue organization and that the tissue organization is dependent on the extracellular matrix and the microenvironment .
why not ?
thank you .
matthew &apos;s legs don &apos;t work , and he &apos;ll never walk again , and — and he does experience this as an &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; rather than a &quot; &quot; but &quot; &quot; — and he experiences himself to be healed and whole .
and one cup of coffee doesn &apos;t amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world .
it &apos;s about stocks and bonds and fortune 500 companies .
we know that we thrive when we stay at our own leading edge , and it &apos;s why the deliberate incomplete is inbuilt into creation myths .
mastery is about sacrificing for your craft and not for the sake of crafting your career .
so now put yourself in a city center .
over the last two decades , our government negotiators and policymakers have been coming together to discuss climate change , and they &apos;ve been focused on avoiding a two-degree centigrade warming above pre-industrial levels .
anyone here ever listen to what their mom told them to do ?
so how does the u.s. respond to all of the above ?
if he was an ideal teacher , he would have responded like i said before , &quot; &quot; young-ha may not have a talent for drawing , but he has a gift for making up stories , &quot; &quot; and he would have encouraged me .
and in this moment , the nagging devil disappears .
four years earlier , when i was one , after the chernobyl accident , the rain came down black , and my sister &apos;s hair fell out in clumps , and i spent nine months in the hospital .
on our 10 year anniversary of being in the u.s. , we decided to celebrate by reserving a room at the hotel that we first stayed in when we got to the u.s.
and i don &apos;t know if it was delirium setting in or what , but they told me later i had a smile on my face the entire time .
and once we got there , we were pushing aside these ice chunks trying to get into waves .
they go through life deliberately alternating between two zones : the learning zone and the performance zone .
( laughter ) &quot; we &apos;ll learn from your mistakes ! &quot;
this is the phrase that i &apos;ve used in some stuff which i &apos;ve done with a think tank in london called demos , where we &apos;ve been looking at these people who are amateurs — i.e. , they do it for the love of it — but they want to do it to very high standards .
the one thing i think i disagree with about yochai &apos;s presentation is when he said the internet causes this distributive capacity for innovation to come alive .
a squirrel had in fact chewed on my internet . ( laughter ) and then i got this image in my head of what would happen if you yanked the wire from the wall and if you started to follow it . where would it go ?
now there are six cables and more coming , three down each coast .
jk : so , encouraged by this success , we went back to rio for a second project , and we stumbled upon this street .
we started looking for funding , but instead , we just ran into questions , like , how many houses are you going to paint ?
and of course , there are going to be limitations to this technique , just like there were with the visual microphone , but we found that it works in a lot of situations that you might not expect , especially if you give it longer videos .
in fact , i &apos;ve actually done this with my cell phone before .
this is the one i work on . it &apos;s called the atlas detector — 44 meters wide , 22 meters in diameter .
and i promised to come back and give you an update on how that machine worked .
why do you get out of bed in the morning ?
nobody bought one .
and in my case , as i was about five years old , this meant asking my mum .
so it was natural for me as a child to fear being swallowed by the void , but it wasn &apos;t rational , because being swallowed by the void is not something that any of us will ever live to experience .
so i &apos;ll leave you with one of the most compelling facts about this technology and these kinds of vehicles .
it &apos;s incredible just how light this thing is .
so from that perspective , maybe we will always be asking questions and never be able to fully answer them .
those planets which are much closer to a star like the sun would be so hot that our form of life wouldn &apos;t exist .
these clouds form in the region of mountains .
but i think they &apos;re beautiful , don &apos;t you ?
so the expansion of space is actually speeding up .
or if we look in other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum , we see that there &apos;s a lot of gas in this cluster , as well .
citywide , there are 80,000 vacant homes .
so the descendants of the great migration could either become precision watchmakers at shinola , like willie h. , who was featured in one of their ads last year , or they can actually grow a business that would service companies like shinola .
with the service economy , it is about improving quality .
they just care about three things and three things only : price , price and price .
so when we think about scaling up metabolic materials , we can start thinking about ecological interventions like repair of atolls , or reclamation of parts of a city that are damaged by water .
but imagine what the properties of this limestone block might be if the surfaces were actually in conversation with the atmosphere .
patient : nothing . neurologist : nothing ? okay .
do we also have specialized brain regions for other senses , like hearing ?
me only existed in the trying .
and the fire that burned in me on day three through six of chemo is the fire that is burning in the forests of the world .
after alexander , the other empires , babylon declines , falls into ruins , and all the traces of the great babylonian empire are lost — until 1879 when the cylinder is discovered by a british museum exhibition digging in babylon .
is iran still to be the defender of the oppressed ?
it &apos;s about sharing . it &apos;s about honesty . it &apos;s about identity .
who prefers the whole-meal bread ?
and it still works today in fast-growing emerging cities .
and it worked .
and that ephemeral nature of the hydrothermal vent community isn &apos;t really different from some of the areas that i &apos;ve seen in 35 years of traveling around , making films .
it &apos;s got living coral , fish all over the place , crystal clear water , and you go , &quot; &quot; how did that happen ? &quot; &quot; well , how it happened is the local community galvanized .
humans in the developed world spend more than 90 percent of their lives indoors , where they breathe in and come into contact with trillions of life forms invisible to the naked eye : microorganisms .
and we looked at three different types of rooms .
but it &apos;s not just what he stood for , it &apos;s what his message was .
and that &apos;s what comes to the first step here .
these ambucycles are an ambulance on two wheels .
settlers were saving arabs and arabs were saving settlers .
that &apos;s great .
thank you .
but then they would have to drive back into the city to test those samples in their central lab .
this is a family like any other .
i wished to tell him that , were he to acknowledge my disability , it would be okay , for people are wrong to marvel at those like me who smile as we limp .
abed had said something remarkable .
( laughter ) okay .
it turns out that these long-lived mutants are more resistant to all these diseases .
they call it fika , which means more than a coffee break .
instead , he asked for help and he found someone who had designed the jockey club in new york .
and , as a consequence , the western view of africa &apos;s economic dilemma is framed wrongly .
we have 81 units of local government .
now if responsibility and transparency are two of the cornerstones of representative government , autonomous robotic weapons could undermine both .
this raises the very real possibility of anonymous war .
i came because i wanted to study english literature .
i want you to come back to that time .
this family mission statement is a great way to identify what it is that you do right .
another great way to tell your story is to tell your children where they came from .
she took care of me as a child , so i &apos;m not talking about statistic now — now it &apos;s oral history in my family .
but we have to bring united states forward quite a while to find the same health of the united states as we have in the philippines .
mexico temperature has been , air temperature has been something between 15 , up to 30 degrees c , and people enjoyed themselves .
we are not borrowing energy from our neighbors .
no-face is lonely and he wants to make friends , and he thinks the way to do it is by luring them to him and producing gold in his hand .
they let their freak flag fly and it &apos;s beautiful .
so if you look at the extremes , those plans that offered you two funds , participation rates were around in the mid-70s — still not as high as we want it to be .
they &apos;re all important choices . &quot; &quot; and the first thing i do is i ask the employees , &quot; &quot; tell me how these choices are different from one another .
so i made it up in my mind that if i was ever released from prison that i would do everything in my power to help change that .
for the first time , i was exposed to the internet , social media , cars that talk like kitt from &quot; &quot; knight rider . &quot; &quot; but the thing that fascinated me the most was phone technology .
yay .
but the question i asked is , is it possible to linger in the stratosphere ?
in those moments , i &apos;m connected to everything — the ground , the air , the sounds , the energy from the audience .
because , hey , if we &apos;re all living in ourselves and mistaking it for life , then we &apos;re devaluing and desensitizing life .
so what about mars ?
what we decided to do is first look for those ingredients for life .
because if you have cleaner water and slower water , you can imagine a new way of living with that water .
and you can see from the arrow here indicating &quot; &quot; you are here , &quot; &quot; i &apos;m trying to sort of blend and meld these two very divergent fields of urbanism and ecology , and sort of bring them together in an exciting new way .
fans want to be on the field .
thank you .
and her afghan network was just absolutely everywhere .
i decided that i &apos;d continue filming and make another movie .
here &apos;s jim just a few weeks before he died , celebrating a birthday he didn &apos;t expect to see .
i &apos;d like to talk about increasing our chances of dying well .
this is the other side of the building .
because this was perceived to be a weather problem . ( laughter ) you know , this is a building designed like a dvd player . ( laughter ) audio jack , power supply — and look , you know these things are important architectural jobs for firms , right ?
the uk &apos;s techdemosat-1 , launched in 2014 , for example , was designed for end-of-life disposal via a small drag sail .
now , we send satellites to different orbits depending on what they &apos;re needed for .
so i started a project called life edited at lifeedited.org to further this conversation and to find some great solutions in this area .
would that give me a little more freedom ?
we got a pool . we filled it with milk .
you might be wondering how i came up with this idea of turning people into paintings .
( laughter ) what you &apos;re seeing here is a water filtration system .
i mean , the whole thing is is super-sustainable .
we know how that turns out .
the anaconda , the largest snake , the capybara , the largest rodent .
well , this happens to be the most important painting we have in italy by leonardo da vinci , and look at the wonderful images of faces that nobody has seen for five centuries . look at these portraits .
so we thought of an augmented reality application using a tablet . let me show you just simulating what we could be doing , any of us could be doing , in a museum environment .
( laughter ) basically , the reason you haven &apos;t heard about this program is because it was introduced last year on june 29 .
it will immediately play you that song or that band .
i started to have favorite colors , and i started to dream in colors .
i heard a telephone tone , and it felt green because it sounded just like the color green .
( applause )
and so perhaps once they cleaned up the pigeon droppings , get the disk kind of operational again , normal operations would resume .
&quot; i want to give you a hug . &quot;
the start of the story , where this means guy , and that is a ponytail on a passer-by .
it was a significant culture shift for an organization that had secrecy in its dna .
now , we did what we knew , how we had grown up , and one of the things that we knew , that was in our dna , was secrecy .
it &apos;s a crazy matrix experience .
there &apos;s a lot of information here .
ca : how big ?
ca : ok .
they &apos;re built on the hills , inland from the beaches in rio , and you can see that the houses are just cantilevered over the natural obstructions .
armstrong and his friends had no water — they bought it from a nearby tap owner — no toilet — the families in this compound shared a single pit-latrine — and no sewers or sanitation .
volunteer : 8649 .
volunteer : 529 . ab : 529 .
so can you guess what happened to this number ?
now the truth is , when we published this quiz , the census data that it &apos;s based on was already a few years old .
it &apos;s the only game in the world that i know of that allows you , the player , the opportunity to experience 10 positive emotions in 60 seconds or less .
how many people are like me . just admit it .
and in paris , the ipcc released its study confirming man &apos;s impact on global warming .
and when we take out the u.s. and look at the remaining 21 percent , we see a lot of iraq — that &apos;s that big green thing there — and little else .
and bob may say something like , i sincerely appreciate the effort and passion that have gone into your presentation , blah blah blah — ( laughter ) but honestly , it &apos;s total nonsense .
ok , if these principles are so powerful , you might be thinking , why are they not commonplace in business ?
so it &apos;s exciting potential for this .
that &apos;s amazing parallel and distributed computing power , new design possibilities .
reduce occurrence of cancer by a drug that doesn &apos;t even touch the cancer .
you then have some anatomic descriptions , you get that ct scan : &quot; &quot; there &apos;s a three centimeter mass in the liver . &quot; &quot; you then have some body part descriptions : &quot; it &apos;s in the liver , in the breast , in the prostate . &quot;
this isn &apos;t to say that , poof , magically we quit smoking .
so why is it so hard to pay attention ?
there &apos;s lots to find .
so it doesn &apos;t apply to 20 percent of the world .
and through her self-defense , she grabbed their adam &apos;s apples , she punched them in the eyes and she got herself free and out of the car .
and i will tell you that what happened is through that shattering , listening to the stories of eight-year-old girls who had their insides eviscerated , who had guns and bayonets and things shoved inside them so they had holes , literally , inside them where their pee and poop came out of them .
it fills me with wonder , and it opens my heart .
the little things in life , sometimes that we forget about , like pollination , that we take for granted .
let &apos;s take a step back .
however , if you take a look back and think about what have been the most empowering innovations that enabled us to build artificial machines that swim and artificial machines that &#91; fly &#93; , you find that it was only through understanding the underlying physical mechanisms of swimming and flight that we were able to build these machines .
and those differences can be biological , physical , functional , political , cultural , socioeconomic .
where are you traveling ? what are you reading ?
it &apos;s predicted they may go extinct — about a third of them — within about 30 years .
and as you know , there &apos;s been a very weak response , up until recently , to actually collect the oil .
how do they stay competitive ?
in the world of finance , bitcoin and crypto-currencies are revolutionizing the way we move money around the world , but the challenge with these technologies is the barrier to entry is incredibly high , right ?
if the case is that social media is dominating old media and women are dominating social media , then does that mean that women are going to take over global media ?
in our media environment , it &apos;s as if they don &apos;t even exist .
how long shall they kill our prophets while we stand aside and look ?
surrounded by tall , concrete walls , steel bars , where razor wire have a way of cutting away at the hopes for a brighter tomorrow .
and i brought a little segment to give you of duke brady &apos;s &quot; &quot; canopy rap . &quot; &quot; ( music ) that &apos;s duke !
or perhaps al gore and naturally 7 could make a song about climate change that would really make you clap your hands .
( laughter ) so , according to this , the australians and the japanese as well as the mexicans are very happy . ( laughter )
( laughter ) so this is one . ( laughter )
los angeles cleaned up its port , which was 40 percent of carbon emissions , and as a result got rid of about 20 percent of carbon .
and they are doing it .
she was fat .
if obesity is nothing more than a proxy for metabolic illness , what good does it do us to punish those with the proxy ?
we need initial upfront investment to train doctors , nurses , health administration and community health workers throughout the country , to set up the information technology , the solar energy , the water and sanitation , the transportation infrastructure .
and two , will it do it at a price that will enable the country to sustain a health care system without foreign donors after five to 10 years ?
there , we met maría rachid .
jc : one of the first countries that we traveled to was nepal .
that is polarity .
as my girlfriend and my niece hold hands and skip out the front of the door , i turn to my sister and say , &quot; &quot; was it worth it ? &quot; &quot; and she said , &quot; &quot; are you kidding me ?
all the parts of the document in red are not intelligible .
so , how are we going to change the world ?
it &apos;s the reason that the tip of the washington monument is made of aluminum .
and we have three billion new minds coming online to work with us to solve the grand challenges , to do that which we must do .
this is the interpretation of it . as you can see , i carry a 32 percent risk of prostate cancer , 22 percent risk of psoriasis and a 14 percent risk of alzheimer &apos;s disease .
we &apos;re able to gather information about our environment .
this is the blue bar which is driving costs down .
portugal was able to consolidate its fragmented school system , raise quality and improve equity , and so did hungary .
in seconds , we can pick out every pattern here .
well i thought , when you &apos;re looking at information at this level , it &apos;s so easy to lose track of what you &apos;re doing .
the european union delegation in kabul came into this and hired me to work inside the ministry of public health , to lobby this approach — we succeeded .
so , i am a jungian psychoanalyst , and i went to afghanistan in january 2004 , by chance , on an assignment for medica mondiale .
i &apos;d like to share with you how ordinary things can become something magical and wondrous .
this device allows me to symbolically extract other people &apos;s eyes , so i have a diversity of eyes to use for my other sculptures .
that is , at stage 3 or 4 , and i believe that is too late .
we have 21st-century medical treatments and drugs to treat cancer , but we still have 20th-century procedures and processes for diagnosis , if any .
every time you think of a city , you &apos;ve got to think green .
i don &apos;t need to be there anymore to know and to administrate the city .
not every day is going to offer us a chance to save somebody &apos;s life , but every day offers us an opportunity to affect one .
now in our town , where the volunteers supplement a highly skilled career staff , you have to get to the fire scene pretty early to get in on any action .
it is burned into my memory .
my father was a san franciscan .
we &apos;ll have to be a lot more creative than we are right now .
and then next we have to provide training , capacity building .
we &apos;re in a situation that could unfold to be a natural phenomenon we don &apos;t understand or an alien technology we don &apos;t understand .
what &apos;s amazing to me is that this star would have never been found by computers because we just weren &apos;t looking for something like this .
i &apos;m not as bad a shot as i thought i might have been .
next stop was georgia .
( laughter ) and you thought it looked ...
but running parallel to this excitement , the excitement that suddenly , somehow , we were cool — ( laughter ) there was also this reservation .
( laughter ) and indeed they had .
i wanted to test the limits of the system .
and the cables go really continent to continent .
we pump the fluid through one of these systems , and we press the button , and it &apos;s analyzed for the genomic character .
you see an opportunity and you decide what you &apos;re going to do to try to seize that .
so with that in mind , this particular incident has led to the things that i &apos;m working on now .
what we actually want to do is we want to take your email and turn it into something that looks more like this , but more importantly , we want to do it in a way that you can &apos;t even tell that it &apos;s happened .
first , you encrypt the connection between your computer and the email server .
she came to see me after discovering a breast lump .
but i recognize — ( applause ) i recognize that the adoption of this technology will depend as much on economic and political forces as it will on the soundness of the science .
maybe it &apos;s not a zombie apocalypse movie .
if that persuasive appeal that you &apos;re making to your republican uncle means that he doesn &apos;t just have to change his view , he &apos;s got to change his underlying values , too , that &apos;s not going to go very far .
what is there , then ?
of course the water that flows through the waterfall is different every single instance .
( applause )
we are now very comfortable imagining unimaginable technological achievement .
your child &apos;s face .
but by listening to changes in the amplitude and frequency of those waves , we can hear the story that those waves are telling .
so , a spanish woman who was dying of t.b. had a donor trachea , they took all the cells off the trachea , they spraypainted her stem cells onto that cartilage .
this is an actual bill .
woman : have you ever been ?
committee chairman : do you remember january 6th , 1999 ?
you can see the calcium buildup on the head of the poporo gourd .
and i recently made a film called &quot; &quot; the buddhist science of the mind . &quot; &quot; why did we use that word , science ?
bring this campaign to these countries .
then in early 2007 , a really interesting thing happened .
since bala himself will be speaking at ted i won &apos;t spend too much time on him here today , except to say that he really succeeds at making the invisible visible .
chitra basically remixes and re-titles these iconic images to tease out some of the sexual and gender politics embedded in these deeply influential comics .
and i &apos;ve learned that , actually , a lot of scientists are historians , too .
( laughter ) now , when you hear the word &quot; &quot; camel , &quot; &quot; what may come to mind is one of these , the bactrian camel of east and central asia .
but in fact , they found something very surprising .
you would be issuing orders from above .
and in this picture , i had actually never had a boyfriend in real life .
these heels are very uncomfortable , so good thing i wasn &apos;t going to wear them .
i didn &apos;t make you have a baby .
physically , i had a severe hemorrhage during labor , and major tearing , so i could barely get up , sit or walk .
some of my earliest memories are of giant ships blocking the end of my street , as well as the sun , for a lot of the year .
i had other dreams , not necessarily practical ones , but at the age of eight , i was bequeathed a guitar .
there weren &apos;t many of them available , and they weren &apos;t quite as easy to find as the foreign books .
she introduced them to a book about the southern life that they had left behind .
it &apos;s interesting to me .
and part of the narrative of that is sometimes that it &apos;s about increased incarceration rates .
and companies that actually define a true north , things that are nonnegotiable whether times are good , bad , ugly — doesn &apos;t matter .
of not just creating economic value but creating social value .
but in fact , there &apos;s something else that we &apos;ve developed in the process of developing these autonomous cars .
for instance , the resting brain tends to generate a lot of alpha waves .
i call them my ghost , and by having witnessed their suffering from close , you take a bit of that suffering on yourself .
he was furious that the guards may have leaked some details about his private life .
i also think we &apos;ll shift from craving obedience from our things to valuing autonomy .
and even our most advanced tools do nothing without our explicit direction .
really interesting — talking gets in the way .
movable cards produce better systems models , because we iterate much more fluidly .
for each of these successful authoritarian governments in east asia , there &apos;s a matched failure .
the adult literacy rate in china is 77 percent as compared with 48 percent in india .
it &apos;s like mushrooms coming through concrete .
i have a little mantra .
the other thing i would add is that this is not a new view .
so i actually spend most of my &quot; &quot; world 3.0 &quot; &quot; book working through a litany of market failures and fears that people have that they worry globalization is going to exacerbate .
and then again , india does not have the luxury of making its environment dirty , because it has to marry environment and development .
but today , with globalization , with outsourcing , english has become a language of aspiration .
it makes him a better student at school because it inspires in him a sense of responsibility , perseverance and punctuality that will greatly help him at school .
child : after all this time here , music is life .
and folks say we need to choose either or .
the arts and sciences are not separate .
and that &apos;s a video , a high-definition video that is transmitted through that light beam .
and you only have to notice , where we have light , there is a potential way to transmit data .
and they want the washing machine .
( applause )
and i wonder whether that freedness could be transferred to him .
and i even began to feel that this book may be perceived by my father as an act of filial devotion .
let me advance the slide , and now i &apos;ll go back .
there &apos;s also a wireless network in the car , which can be reached from many different ways .
and i went to school here .
i engaged in actions i thought were correct .
in a word , she stank .
so now , mahabuba , she is saving the lives of hundreds , thousands , of women .
today , i am going to show you how this tablet and this virtual-reality headset that i &apos;m wearing are going to completely revolutionize science education .
this is an intelligent tablet that allows me to read about relevant theory .
this comet had to be specially selected because a , you have to be able to get to it , and b , it shouldn &apos;t have been in the solar system too long .
comets contain the original material from which our solar system was formed , so they &apos;re ideal to study the components that were present at the time when earth , and life , started .
thank you .
and i &apos;m trying harder and harder .
in our trials on over two and half thousand people , the smartphone with the add-on clip is comparable to a camera that is hugely more expensive and hugely more difficult to transport .
and so we developed peek , a smartphone &#91; system &#93; that enables community healthcare workers and empowers them to deliver eye care everywhere .
in 1982 , in the middle of the cold war in soviet siberia , a pipeline exploded with a burst of 3 kilotons , the equivalent of a fourth of the hiroshima bomb .
now we know today — this was revealed by thomas reed , ronald reagan &apos;s former u.s. air force secretary — this explosion was actually the result of a cia sabotage operation , in which they had managed to infiltrate the it management systems of that pipeline .
the kids who resisted scored 250 points higher on the sat .
they sacrifice fun time . they sacrifice personal indulgence .
so , the ponds , the open bodies , are everywhere , right from sri lanka to kashmir , and in other parts also .
( laughter ) ( applause ) dry water body . children are standing on a very difficult device to explain .
there are crisis maps , election maps , corruption maps , and even environmental monitoring crowd maps .
the other interesting thing for us — we like sensors — is this idea that you could have an on-ramp for the internet of things .
this reverse engineering can also enlist help from the human record preserved in prehistory .
there are many differences among the arts , but there are also universal , cross-cultural aesthetic pleasures and values .
we were actually recording history .
and we came up with this idea of issuing bonds , press freedom bonds .
and yet , america and africa have got a common interest .
but we did get an agreement on climate change .
and they can navigate the world using their ears .
here you see four gray tiles on your left , seven gray tiles on the right .
and this little girl comes up to me .
thank you .
and she does really good business . in fact , i watched her walk through the streets hawking . and before you knew it , there was a crowd of women around her , buying these dresses .
it was in kenya , and i want to share it with you .
( laughter ) ( applause ) sb : this girl was working as a maid before she came to school .
before that i feel like i wasn &apos;t like this .
but , like sardinia , okinawa has a few social constructs that we can associate with longevity .
you know the two most dangerous years in your life are the year you &apos;re born , because of infant mortality , and the year you retire .
and you come here to tell me that i cannot keep on living here ?
the sum of them : 52 million dollars .
and you know what shocked me , although it shouldn &apos;t have , was other research last year that determined humiliation was a more intensely felt emotion than either happiness or even anger .
remember , just a few years earlier , news was consumed from just three places : reading a newspaper or magazine , listening to the radio , or watching television .
teachers paid less than what it costs them to be here .
reading textbooks is stressful , but reading does not matter when you feel your story is already written , either dead or getting booked .
( music ) but , what if ...
so , something has got to give . and that is what i want .
thomas jefferson , i think , really expressed this quite well .
as oil prices go up , energy patents go up .
that ’ s all there is to it .
it ’ s a neural system that ’ s wired up to reward the brain for doing a grubby clerical job .
i tried again : &quot; &quot; all those present held their breath ? &quot; &quot; i thought this sounded vaguely judicial .
( laughter ) thank you .
ca : what do you picture that glider being used for ?
the path to truly new , never-been-done-before things always has failure along the way .
we are stealing nature from our children .
and this is crazy . this is just patently false .
after some awkward silence , he goes , &quot; have you forgotten your name ? &quot;
if you look at all of the ancient literature — ancient chinese , icelandic , greek , indian and even the original hebrew bible — they all mention very few colors .
let &apos;s continue with that same excerpt .
another adaptation would be this piece .
the left and the right halves of the chamber are filled with two different odors , and a security camera watches as the flies pace up and down between them .
you can exploit this to make sure that only some neurons contain our light-activated pore and others don &apos;t .
until we live in a society where every human is assured dignity in their labor so that they can work to live well , not only work to survive , there will always be an element of those who seek the open road as a means of escape , of liberation and , of course , of rebellion .
many of you might be wondering why anyone would choose a life like this , under the thumb of discriminatory laws , eating out of trash cans , sleeping under bridges , picking up seasonal jobs here and there .
( aquatic noises ) so this video was taken at aquarius undersea laboratory four miles off the coast of key largo , about 60 feet below the surface .
that &apos;s the only way that we could have done this .
martha gellhorn , who &apos;s one of my heroes , once said , &quot; you can only love one war . the rest is responsibility . &quot;
there was no kind of compensation for , you &apos;re a tutsi , you &apos;re a hutu , you might have killed my mother , you might have killed my father .
a room like this , nonetheless .
there was pride in a room where net worth and assets under management surpassed half a trillion dollars .
it changes by trial and error .
and people were scared .
the basic story here is that what used to be vertically integrated , oligopolistic competition among essentially similar kinds of competitors is evolving , by one means or another , from a vertical structure to a horizontal one .
first of all , let &apos;s think about transaction costs .
instead , these laws and laws around the world use the rather awkward analogy of property .
is this promoting the progress of useful arts ?
it &apos;s not really what we do , is it , when we &apos;re at our best ?
so jogging those zones of familiarity is one way to think about strangeness , and it &apos;s a problem faced not just by individuals today , but also by organizations , organizations that are trying to embrace massively new opportunities .
or another analogy would be , a caterpillar has been turned into a butterfly .
and ultimately , the mystical or sometimes called the &quot; &quot; anagogical &quot; &quot; level .
i think the challenge for us is — i &apos;m very certain that that will happen , the challenge is , will we develop the kind of educational tools and things with the net to let us take advantage of that device ?
it &apos;s not the nation-states that have potential access to mass destruction , but individuals .
no one &apos;s role was too small ; everyone &apos;s role was vital .
you &apos;re feeling unstoppable .
the nannies and housekeepers who marched with their families and their employers &apos; families — their activism got us an international treaty on domestic workers &apos; rights .
i remember my auntie so clearly , it felt like she had been part of my life when i was much older .
ebola on one person &apos;s doorstep could soon be on ours .
and we worked around the clock trying to do everything we could , trying to help the individuals , trying to get attention , but we also did one other simple thing .
i want to warn you about that .
i think it &apos;s probably the case that , in the human evolutionary lineage , even before there were homo sapiens , feelings like compassion and love and sympathy had earned their way into the gene pool , and biologists have a pretty clear idea of how this first happened .
let me first say that probably the best model to explain why wealth is so much more concentrated than income is a dynamic , dynastic model where individuals have a long horizon and accumulate wealth for all sorts of reasons .
of course , the growth rate following the industrial revolution rose , typically from zero to one to two percent , but at the same time , the rate of return to capital also rose so that the gap between the two did not really change .
we all use the same technology , and what that means then is that for governments to have the capability to hack into the computers of the real bad guys , they also have to have the capability to hack into our devices too .
as i said , it &apos;s a $ 5 billion industry .
the second is the nature of the virus .
so there was a lot that was missing .
people are reeling from all sorts of unnatural disasters , displacing them from their ancestral homes and leaving them without a chance at making a decent living .
but what &apos;s most heartening right now is that despite these challenges , what we &apos;re seeing is that there &apos;s a network of africans all across the continent who are rising up and fighting back and demanding climate justice .
using the oxytocin inhaler , we ran more studies .
who is the center of the wedding solar system ?
there &apos;s an example of the same thing on a finger , showing you basically what it looks like .
prick a finger , you get some blood , about 50 microliters .
here you can see some pictures of what are called green roofs , or urban agriculture .
you could even get your own hive if you want .
this doesn &apos;t mean we should ignore software , or information , or computation . &quot; &quot; and that &apos;s in fact probably what i &apos;m going to try and tell you about .
so can you make a machine that could make any prescription lens very quickly on site ?
in 2003 , after my studies , it was banned in the european union , but in that same year , the united states epa re-registered the compound .
no , i &apos;m just joking .
( applause )
you can imagine what it was like in the winter at 10,000 feet .
we can make spines that catch on simulated debris and collapse on removal to easily pull them out .
i call the new robot rise , for &quot; &quot; robot in scansorial environment &quot; &quot; — that &apos;s a climbing environment — and we have an extraordinary team of biologists and engineers creating this robot .
so i started to say , &quot; &quot; hey , man , you are too much !
idea about women .
religions are fascinating in the way they try and combine the two .
ca : actually , let me just ask a question .
it &apos;s completely non-invasive , sensors in the crutches that send signals back to our onboard computer that is sitting here at her back .
soldier : with the hulc exoskeleton , i can carry 200 lbs. over varied terrain for many hours .
though when the dodgers abandoned us to come to l.a. , i lost faith in baseball until i moved to boston and became an irrational red socks fan .
it was said when he got a copy of the king james bible or &quot; &quot; aesop &apos;s fables , &quot; &quot; he was so excited he couldn &apos;t sleep .
( gunshot reverbs church ) or in a canyon .
on the completely other side , adding a lot of reverb to a voice is going to make us think that we &apos;re listening to a flashback , or perhaps that we &apos;re inside the head of a character or that we &apos;re listening to the voice of god .
and the women , who i was so privileged to meet when there were three survivors , told these stories about lying in their cots in the refugee camps .
but agnes cared more about the trappings of power than she did principle at the end .
great , right ?
i need to take a breath .
so there &apos;d be two people on the bunks and two people on the floor , one with nowhere to go except right next to the filthy toilet , which was never cleaned .
right now , i &apos;m working at a civil rights organization in dc , called equal justice under law .
a servant , a lovely servant .
not the wife , not the kids . okay , the maid can come in and clean . &quot; &quot; she &apos;s in the studio . he &apos;s got her in the studio , they &apos;re together .
so there you go . my name is john hodgman .
now , i &apos;m sure you recognize this object ; many of you probably saw it as you were landing your private zeppelins at los angeles international airport over the past couple of days .
walk past him .
this is me wearing my standard competitive memorizer &apos;s training kit .
now lol , we generally think of as meaning &quot; &quot; laughing out loud . &quot; &quot; and of course , theoretically , it does , and if you look at older texts , then people used it to actually indicate laughing out loud .
now don &apos;t get me wrong , writing has certain advantages .
if you don &apos;t think that way , well , you have a lot of company in the history of western philosophy , because the tidy idea , you know , people criticized it .
in fact , let &apos;s start right now .
imagine how vulnerable the system is to deliberate attacks .
and so , there are many of those things that start to happen .
i just came out of the weight shack from working out , and i saw an older gentleman that i knew standing in the middle of the yard just looking up at the sky .
they &apos;re not robots , and there &apos;s nothing special about them .
just flash it , scare the guy . he &apos;s a punk .
turns out , tony &apos;s got the philosophy muscle .
and all at no extra cost , no selection , and allowing the pupils the route into university , even if many of them would want to become entrepreneurs and have manual jobs as well .
and i hope that a few of you at least can help us make that happen .
no one believed that a global agreement could ever be possible .
and pretty soon , we began to see changes happening in many areas , precipitated by thousands of people , including many of you here today , and i thank you .
miko : i don &apos;t think so .
and sometimes i feel like i can &apos;t really enjoy myself unless it &apos;s like a vacation , like when i get mondays and all those days off .
last year we killed a project in automated vertical farming .
three and a half years ago , when we had these lexus , retrofitted , self-driving cars in testing , they were doing so well , we gave them out to other googlers to find out what they thought of the experience .
so the printing press , ladies and gentlemen , was driven entirely by the printing of forgivenesses and had nothing to do with reading .
and we never think about the hidden connection .
if form follows fiction , we could think of architecture and buildings as a space of stories — stories of the people that live there , of the people that work in these buildings .
it can be glazed over and turned into a giant exhibitional performance space .
and i think , i think , that looking at the technology , this will be cheaper than or the same price as natural gas , and you don &apos;t have to refuel it for 30 years , which is an advantage for the developing world .
i think that i &apos;ve designed this reactor here that can be an innovative source of energy , provide power for all kinds of neat scientific applications , and i &apos;m really prepared to do this .
but that doesn &apos;t help because there were very few species and volume of biomass there in the first place .
these red dots , these red areas , basically provide the food and livelihood for more than half a billion people .
peter diamandis : probably the most difficult thing that i had to do was raise the capital for this . it was literally impossible .
as we are going out there and taking on a new frontier , we should be allowed to risk .
and i flew it .
and stop where you want .
president ford — this is gerald ford &apos;s funeral .
this grid is then said to represent the picture of the world &apos;s feelings in the last few hours , if you will .
and as i believe that human interaction is at the core of our healing , trauma not transformed will be trauma transferred .
a : yes , you did .
they went and searched dreyfus &apos;s apartment , looking for any signs of espionage .
we need to learn how to feel intrigued instead of defensive when we encounter some information that contradicts our beliefs .
and so , in the end , the question of markets is not mainly an economic question .
democracy does not require perfect equality , but what it does require is that citizens share in a common life .
the system works to stay stopped , unless something positive happens .
whatever resource one species is using , another species is likely to be using that at the same time .
it &apos;s over the baby , illuminating a single patient .
so thinking about outcomes , it turns out appearances matter .
what we &apos;re doing is taking the fast routes and not replacing the benefits of the slower work .
it &apos;s in that capacity to work together , think together collectively , which can only be built over time with a lot of work .
this truly is an at-risk population with very few resources to support them .
from all outward appearances , john had everything going for him .
( applause )
and so , i abandoned my dream life for a single room on the backstreets of kyoto , japan , which was the place that had long exerted a strong , really mysterious gravitational pull on me .
and given the state of the world today , there &apos;s really no other option .
as for terrorism , it &apos;s now extremely rare .
and so there &apos;s good news about this , though , because there &apos;s a way to reverse epidemics , and there &apos;s really only three things that are done to reverse epidemics , and the first of it is interrupting transmission .
and so what we decided to do in the year 2000 is kind of put this together in a way by hiring in new categories of workers , the first being violence interruptors .
ah , listen , dear heart .
several years earlier , she &apos;d become the first woman to ski to the south pole .
slim and his friends went through the country and pasted hundreds of photos everywhere to show the diversity in the country .
let &apos;s turn the world inside out together .
you don &apos;t need to believe me . you shouldn &apos;t believe me .
children have been trafficked from other conflict zones to come and work on the coffee plantations .
( laughter ) &quot; the impossibility of february &quot; is that february &apos;s a really wretched month in new york and the images for me conjure up these really awful things .
well , he has some hair but — well , he used to have hair .
and that changes everything .
we &apos;re going to do it the old-fashioned american way , we &apos;re going to invent our way out , working together .
and of course , eventually things settled down .
and besides , we have a great relationship with people in the community and we really don &apos;t want to damage that . &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; so maybe this is what you should do .
the rocket engine begins .
notice all of our rovers and all of our landers have gone to the northern hemisphere .
we have access to it all .
&quot; &quot; and , &quot; &quot; god says , &quot; &quot; my servant continues to get nearer to me , by doing more of what i &apos;ve asked them to do &quot; &quot; — extra credit , we might call it — &quot; &quot; until i love him or love her .
looks simple , but we &apos;ve reiterated this dozens of times by going into the field to talk to doctors , moms and clinicians to ensure that this really meets the needs of the local communities .
so , you then place it into this little pocket back here , and it creates a warm micro-environment for the baby .
but coke noticed something — they noticed that local people were taking the product , buying it in bulk and then reselling it in these hard-to-reach places .
melinda french gates : it feels pretty good , right ?
but , without it , the sun wouldn &apos;t shine .
the first one , the electron , was discovered in 1897 , and the last one , this thing called the tau neutrino , in the year 2000 . actually just — i was going to say , just up the road in chicago . i know it &apos;s a big country , america , isn &apos;t it ?
( applause ) thanks .
and my grandfather was a kind of guy who would not only take things apart , but he got me interested in all sorts of different odd crafts , like , you know , printing , like the letter press . i &apos;m obsessed with printing .
ah , sorry about that .
so let &apos;s give this a try .
i labored in that vineyard for a quarter century before making my way to a little kingdom of the just in upstate south carolina , a methodist-affiliated institution of higher learning called wofford college .
and the gauleiter , who afterwards vanishes from this story , leaned down and whispered into mr. teszler &apos;s ear , &quot; no , do not take the capsule . help is on the way . &quot;
they would always stop by to visit these huge winged bulls that used to guard the gates of that ancient metropolis , and the boy used to be scared of these winged bulls , but at the same time they excited him .
a few days later , we received a call : &quot; &quot; is the data available and can it be used for reconstruction ? &quot; &quot; our answer , of course , was yes .
why is it okay that the government is keeping all of this information ?
thank you .
we &apos;re doing it all over the world now , from ireland to iran to turkey , and we see ourselves going everywhere to change the world .
and we &apos;ll eat together .
but none of them worked .
but he didn &apos;t use new parchment , he used parchment recycled from earlier manuscripts , and there were seven of them .
and in fact , you could do this any which way — cover this thing with all kinds of polygons and triangles and mix them up .
six years ago or so , i left renaissance and went to work at the foundation .
as he often did , velázquez put himself in this painting too .
each one was pinched or carved out of a ball of clay , and it was the imperfections that people cherished .
we &apos;ve had our fair share of skeptics and critics who thought that we were just fooling around with toy planes .
to stop the killing of these animals , battalions of soldiers and rangers are sent to protect nepal &apos;s national parks , but that is not an easy task , because these soldiers have to patrol thousands of hectares of forests on foot or elephant backs .
i mean what other kind of fish , if you approach it right , will say , &quot; &quot; okay , scratch me right there . &quot; &quot; you truly can swim up to a mola — they &apos;re very gentle — and if you approach them right , you can give them a scratch and they enjoy it .
that would mean that your child , you would expect it to gain the weight of six titanics .
other data has the music industry at about 45,000 people .
thank you very much .
mostly it comes from fat pyrolyzing , or burning .
the key physics principle here is when water boils to steam it expands by a factor of 1,600 .
the guardian wrote , &quot; &quot; if art is about transformation , then there can be no more transformative experience .
so , the dialogue with the local and the global , the audience as participant and player and protagonist , the innovative use of site , all of these things come to play in the amazing work of the fantastic french company royal de luxe .
a clinical trial that is considered to be potentially beneficial to the population is more likely to be authorized , and in the absence of good health care systems , almost any offer of medical assistance is accepted as better than nothing .
local communities need to be more involved in establishing the criteria for recruiting participants in clinical trials , as well as the incentives for participation .
what do they have in common ?
this evidence is overwhelming at this point .
sadly , this is only one case of many .
but it &apos;s another chapter in that book that may have an even more lasting impact .
others have used the data to validate insurance claims .
in the case of sneakers , that someone is nike .
i sat down and i thought , &quot; &quot; what is going on ? &quot; &quot; the teacher was running around , and the energy level was high .
within four years we would be blowing everyone in the world away .
february 2001 — in one day we laid off 350 people , and before the bloodshed was finished , 1,000 people had lost their jobs from my companies . i felt sick .
two years ago at ted , i think — i &apos;ve come to this conclusion — i think i may have been suffering from a strange delusion .
and basically the reaction tends to be kind of like this . ( laughter ) br : yeah , that &apos;s our chef de cuisine , chris jones . this is not the only guy that just flips out when we assign a ridiculous task , but a lot of these ideas , they &apos;re hard to understand .
br : and then after a quick dip into some liquid nitrogen to get that perfect sear , we really have something that looks , tastes and behaves like the real thing .
no wonder you rise in the middle of the night to look up the date of a famous battle in a book on war .
he lived , and still does , in rural vermont .
and this video is real time .
this is an average-size greenlandic iceberg .
so what &apos;s going on here is your body says , your immune system sends out all its sentinels and says , &quot; &quot; i don &apos;t know what the heck this is .
i &apos;m thinking dipstick .
and once you &apos;ve folded it into a paper airplane , i want you to take some anthrax — ( laughter ) and i want you to put that in the paper airplane .
and it &apos;s by a guy named pastor rick warren , and it &apos;s called &quot; the porpoise driven life . &quot;
we traveled the country and showed the images , and this was a journey that has started me to the activist path , where i decided to become silent no more , to talk about those things .
i found myself alone , and i didn &apos;t know what to do .
easy to treat . look at the situation in mauritius .
it &apos;s very well known . i &apos;m not going to spend a lot of time on those .
and if you do that for a couple of minutes , you have made the experiencing self of patient a worse off , and you have the remembering self of patient a a lot better off , because now you have endowed patient a with a better story about his experience .
we found that with respect to the happiness of the experiencing self .
e : meow .
e : ooooowww .
this system has — thank you , beautiful assistant — this system has no sounds in it itself until i start putting sounds in it , so there &apos;s no prerecorded samples of any kind .
( music ) so every noise you can hear there is my voice .
i &apos;ll let you in on the answer to the last one that i offer , and that is , it has nothing to do with human beings .
one thing he was thinking of is something that most of us take for granted today , but in his day it wasn &apos;t taken for granted .
apart from all those products , the forest is very important for climate regulation .
it &apos;s almost like half of costa rica every year .
the plant is known as water hyacinth and its botanical name , eichhornia crassipes .
so we have pens , we have tableware , we have purses , we have tissue boxes .
just wanted to drop you a note .
in my career , i &apos;ve responded to and been involved in hundreds of mental illness and suicide calls around the bridge .
i chucked in my job at accenture .
and my little sister wanted to be a pilot — god help her .
it &apos;s the original , excavated wall at the base of the world trade center that withstood the actual pressure from the hudson river for a full year after the event itself .
it &apos;s essentially a way to make a national oral histories archive one conversation at a time .
for example , australia , like about one third of the world &apos;s countries , has copyright exceptions which allow books to be brailled or read for we blind persons .
( laughter ) i no longer would be censored .
so next time you &apos;re at the grocery store , think local , choose organic , know your farmer and know your food .
my little cousin told his dad that he would rather have the organic toasted o &apos;s cereal because birke said he shouldn &apos;t eat sparkly cereal .
thank you .
and they brought this kind of a jeweled parasol , and they put it on the ground .
the trailers themselves are actually hand-built .
what i discovered in these interiors is that there was a disconnect between the exterior shell and the interior architecture of the pieces .
i think .
and so again , here are some animation tests from an early stage .
that was perfectly okay 200 million years ago .
so you &apos;ll be walking along , and google will pop up and say , &quot; &quot; you know , mary , you expressed concern to me a month ago that your glutathione supplement wasn &apos;t getting past the blood-brain barrier .
and so how did she get educated then ?
more and more women , two , three , four times more women , dying of heart disease than men .
hello .
special olympics is transforming more than just the athlete in their sport .
i have dropped a blob of organic yogurt from happy self-actualized local cows on my counter top , and i grab a paper towel and i want to wipe it up .
but my elephant in the living room flies .
testosterone in men diminishes the effects of oxytocin .
( laughter ) jf : i &apos;m showing you the way . ( laughter )
so if you have life hacking — life means hacking , the game of survival — then evolution is a way to extend the game by changing the rules of the game .
so in the center is the most primitive , and this is a genealogical chart of all life on earth . this is all the same six kingdoms .
is it sensitive ? yes .
we &apos;re going to take a joystick , sit in front of our computer , on the earth , and press the joystick forward , and fly around the planet .
difficult question , simple answer : nothing .
what about the data and communication software which we need in the future ?
my answer was ...
not only that , if instead of using my hand with the fingers , i use my hand closed into a fist , that makes this even a little bit more interesting .
and now , if you see , it &apos;s more about the cost-effectiveness : this system costs you $ 300 compared to the $ 20,000 surface tables , or anything like that .
here , i &apos;m dialing a phone number just using my hand .
empowering parents — it doesn &apos;t need justification .
they had sacrificed a lot to give me five years of higher education .
what we &apos;re doing is — people like this a lot , this bird &apos;s eye imagery we work with . it &apos;s this high resolution data .
we took a decimal point off what it cost to build these cities , and that &apos;s how we &apos;re going to be able to scale this out and make this reality a dream .
( laughter ) but growing up at 915 , compassion was not a word to be debated ; it was a sensibility to how we are together .
any other time , but not to the christmas celebration .
now these two cylinders start to rotate .
to look in the speaker &apos;s brain , we asked the speaker to go into the scanner , we scan his brain and then compare his brain responses to the brain responses of the listeners listening to the story .
we worry about cocaine coming from the andean ridge north .
so the question is , so , why are they all standing there holding books ?
you don &apos;t vaccinate a few children .
so in the three years since i talked at ted and showed a prototype , it &apos;s gone from an idea to a real laptop .
and his total lung capacity is twice the size of an average person .
and this guy is perfectly built for holding his breath .
( applause ) and three-fourths believe they not only have the responsibility , but the power to make change .
now this is very unusual , because globally we find that , not surprisingly , people feel better as their country gets richer .
as it turned out , the wealth of information provided by imagenet was a perfect match to a particular class of machine learning algorithms called convolutional neural network , pioneered by kunihiko fukushima , geoff hinton , and yann lecun back in the 1970s and &apos; 80s .
we downloaded nearly a billion images and used crowdsourcing technology like the amazon mechanical turk platform to help us to label these images .
we have less than 500,000 kilometers of borders .
it is the world &apos;s largest megacity .
but to make it more interesting , i &apos;m going to speed up time , and we can watch as voyager 1 flies by titan , which is a hazy moon of saturn .
if you want to keep going , if you want to change the camera angle , you can do that , and because of that , i can show you that voyager 1 doesn &apos;t just fly by saturn .
it &apos;s whatever takes my fancy , really .
technology in x-ray where it &apos;s life-size processed , apart from these large cargo-scanning machines , hasn &apos;t moved on enough for the quality of the image and the resolution to be good enough for what i want to do with it , which is show my pictures big .
but isolation isn &apos;t good .
it &apos;s no small thing to change a prison system .
we &apos;re spending so much money to try to replicate this campaign .
but now i want to actually also question that .
i mentioned renewable energy .
so we &apos;ve launched a women &apos;s open network this week in ikea , and we &apos;ll do whatever it takes to lead the change .
so if it &apos;s fundamentally a resource problem , where are the resources in society ?
serious problems , big problems , pressing problems .
what drives the disability for these disorders like schizophrenia and bipolar and depression ?
we don &apos;t have all the facts . we don &apos;t actually even know what the tools will be , nor what to precisely look for in every case to be able to get there before the behavior emerges as different .
it would take us to 2045 .
so it &apos;s really important that you know that right now we have over 15,000 nuclear weapons in the hands of nine nations .
take another look .
but i was getting younger than everybody else ?
the accusation was that i had successfully prepared an attentat on stalin &apos;s life .
i have so much to say . i have to think what i am going to say .
and therefore tradition becomes more important , not less important .
why else do greeks demand the return of the elgin marbles ?
if we can look at the activation in the brain that &apos;s producing the pain , we can form 3d models and watch in real time the brain process information , and then we can select the areas that produce the pain .
he can look at these 65,000 points of activation per second .
so for those of you who seek to be famous , we can learn from the 25 most famous political figures , authors , actors and so on .
if it &apos;s very large , maybe you &apos;re benefiting from propaganda .
for starters , we now live longer , and so age more slowly .
i was then 37 years old , &quot; &quot; an age of discretion , &quot; &quot; wrote william trevor .
i think it &apos;s being hidden on purpose .
they get in the gulf stream , they go all the way to europe .
you know , this project for me is a way for me to bridge that gap and remember everything that i &apos;ve done .
so if i live to see 80 years of age , i &apos;m going to have a five-hour video that encapsulates 50 years of my life .
now , this — using counting to compute and build these kinds of things by this kind of developmental process is something that also has bearing on craig venter &apos;s question .
here &apos;s the dna origami , and what we can do is we can write 32 on both edges of the dna origami , and we can now use our watering can and water with tiles , and we can start growing tiles off of that and create a square .
the interesting thing is of course the rollercoaster does not really exist .
now , who should we thank for the success ?
if it &apos;s a tail , you crack open the champagne .
when you look at dna , there &apos;s a sequence of not two things — heads and tails — but four letters — as , gs , cs and ts .
in fact , while we drove 140,000 miles , people didn &apos;t even notice .
like this .
you know that what you need to do is possible to do , even though difficult , and sense of time disappears , you forget yourself , you feel part of something larger .
that &apos;s why you can &apos;t hear more than two people .
i took here a model from robotics — it &apos;s called the subsumption architecture .
the more usual case is overeating .
this was a randomized trial .
this is the same procedure , but now done minimally invasively , with only three holes in the body where they &apos;re taking the heart and simply injecting stem cells through a laparoscopic procedure .
this is just a tiny part of the sky the kepler stares at , where it searches for planets by measuring the light from over 150,000 stars , all at once , every half hour , and very precisely .
in just over two years of operations , we &apos;ve found over 1,200 potential new planetary systems around other stars .
but i &apos;d like to supplement their work with a little psychological trick , and the trick is this .
it &apos;s partly due to tax cuts that were unfunded , but it &apos;s due primarily to the rise of entitlement spending , especially medicare .
don &apos;t do that .
to give you some background on me , i grew up the youngest of eight .
at the age of 12 , sahar was married .
law as a point of leverage is crucial in protecting all of us .
at that time , i was staying at the institute for advanced studies in princeton — for many years , the home of albert einstein and arguably the most holy place for mathematical research in the world .
of this curve , the famous scientist francis galton said , &quot; &quot; it would have been deified by the greeks if they had known it .
can we stand to have more relationships ?
some of those reforms have been good .
so as you can probably tell , one of the defining aspects of prison life is ingenuity .
in fact , it was teeming with smart , ambitious men whose business instincts were in many cases as sharp as those of the ceos who had wined and dined me six months earlier when i was a rising star in the missouri senate .
as that data matures , they &apos;ll send it to george church , who will work his magic , get passenger pigeon dna out of that .
it &apos;s kind of like an evolution machine .
and while we &apos;re at it , can we please stop the stigma ?
for every one single neuron , you can actually have from 10,000 to 100,000 different connections or dendrites or whatever you want to call it , and every time you learn something , or you have an experience , that bush grows , you know , that bush of information .
we can get efficiency up .
now , the price of food , many people complain about , but in fact , the price of food is going down , and that &apos;s odd because in fact , consumers are not paying for the true cost of food .
in binary , one is 0001 , seven is 0111 .
the point is that you get into trouble when you ask a single question with a single box for an answer , in which that single question actually is many questions with quite different meanings , but with the same words .
now , the typical assumption is that if someone cheats , either there &apos;s something wrong in your relationship or wrong with you .
and it isn &apos;t so much that we &apos;re looking for another person , as much as we are looking for another self .
what are the leakages ?
this is by a local ghanaian entrepreneur , using his own capital .
massive . 609 billion in 2008 — 607 , rather .
this is opec &apos;s revenue , this green box here — 780 billion a year .
( laughter ) so , what happens when a medium suddenly puts a lot of new ideas into circulation ?
world peace . ( laughter ) the telephone ?
and the bubble is 153 ft .
there is a huge disconnect , we believe , between the communicative and discursive space of the mall and the museums that line it to either side .
but one of the things that science really lets us down on is that personality , that individual personality that these animals have .
dj : and in fact , that original thing that we spoke about and designed our lives by — that conservation was all about respect and celebration — is probably true . that &apos;s really what it needs .
your brain does a lot of its work behind the scenes , and that is a good thing , because your conscious mind — how do we put this politely ? — it &apos;s easily distracted .
your brain also has its own sense of what you should weigh , no matter what you consciously believe .
and so we need to move away from this one-size-fits-all model .
so you could really say that researchers trying to understand the cause of disease without being able to have human stem cell models were much like investigators trying to figure out what had gone terribly wrong in a plane crash without having a black box , or a flight recorder .
so i told the singers , &quot; &quot; that &apos;s our goal .
this is &quot; &quot; lux aurumque &quot; &quot; sung by the virtual choir .
parsnips that are too small for supermarket specifications , tomatoes in tenerife , oranges in florida , bananas in ecuador , where i visited last year , all being discarded . this is one day &apos;s waste from one banana plantation in ecuador .
so a country like america has twice as much food on its shop shelves and in its restaurants than is actually required to feed the american people .
actually , i think it &apos;ll eventually be seen as probably the single biggest idea that &apos;s emerged in the past century .
i &apos;ll show you one example here .
one researcher i worked with who works on the molecular mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases came up with experiments that were related directly to the animation that she and i worked on together , and in this way , animation can feed back into the research process .
over the years , i found that animations aren &apos;t just useful for communicating an idea , but they &apos;re also really useful for exploring a hypothesis .
when they were sick , we would collect specimens from them .
they have a series of traps , of snares that they &apos;ve set up to catch wild pigs , snakes , monkeys , rodents — anything they can , really .
and then in moments of high adrenaline , like when something exciting was happening , i would up that photographic frequency to as many as 37 photographs in five minutes .
so this is a picture of me holding one of the first watercolor paintings i ever made .
go around congress .
and i don &apos;t know about you , but i prefer to dine .
because the truth is we never heard from her again .
( applause ) data , evidence makes policy , research , journalism , policing , school boards — everything better .
that &apos;s what we do , and when we leave we manage it down to the last drop of diesel and the last packet of food .
with more people in the world with more stuff , we &apos;ve effectively seen 100 years of price declines in those basic commodities erased in just 10 years .
aren &apos;t we all looking for recognition in our jobs ?
it was a gray november day , and i was overdue .
these are the displacement maps here .
and this is very important light to capture , because this is the light that reflects off the first surface of the skin .
okay , so if you think they &apos;re saying hello or high-fiving , then that means you &apos;re a friendly person .
a guy there said hamster .
we like our neighbors to see our dirty cars and our brown lawns .
now , i know what some of you are probably thinking .
and there &apos;s been lots of other examples , like the corn that was in front of the police station , and the old people &apos;s home that we &apos;ve planted it with food that they can pick and grow .
so we got some land that was donated by a local garden center .
transporting rhinos using helicopters i think is much easier than talking through a spirit that you can &apos;t see , isn &apos;t it ?
thank you very much .
if you put different communication technologies on this logarithmic graph , television , radio , telephone were adopted in decades .
in fact , when we see the end of the line for a particular paradigm , it creates research pressure to create the next paradigm .
so you needed women soldiers out there .
&quot; &quot; america would never kill its way to the end of its wars , &quot; &quot; it argued .
as you can see from these pictures , the spacing between can be used for multiple purposes including agricultural land , range land or open space .
chris anderson : we &apos;re having a debate .
in the eighties , it was probably money .
and you learn while loops by repeating that sequence while i &apos;m standing on one leg .
i take some solace from winston churchill , who put it this way : &quot; &quot; the americans can be counted on to do the right thing once they have exhausted the alternatives . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) thank you .
so the average manhattanite is consuming gasoline at the rate the rest of the nation hasn &apos;t seen since the &apos; 20s , consuming half of the electricity of dallas .
and of course , if you ask me , i &apos;m going to give you a really optimistic view .
you can play computer games , you can sleep , you can read on the way .
we don &apos;t worry that new york city is going to collapse in on itself quite the way that , you know , rome did , and be 10 percent of its size in 100 years or 200 years .
and what ended up happening is that an entire emerging public health system became convinced that it was the smell that was killing everybody , that was creating these diseases that would wipe through the city every three or four years .
so this is great . this is the digital meeting the physical .
now there &apos;s a very large community of people that are building the tools that we need to do things together effectively .
and he wadded up the clay horse and he threw it back in the bin .
and now when the kid comes , it &apos;s an experience .
we don &apos;t really know why , but we think it &apos;s something to do with the food source and maybe the oxygen in the water .
so here we are .
ev : take the two doors to go out . the door is on your right .
i want to be independent .
how is it that this organism can be so large , and yet be one cell wall thick , whereas we have five or six skin layers that protect us ?
when you look at the mycelium , they &apos;re highly branched .
thank you for making your site .
( laughter ) &quot; &quot; inside this envelope is the ripped up remains of a suicide note i didn &apos;t use .
very quickly concrete blocks became the most-used construction unit in the world .
the bricks are color-coded .
since 1950 , during the last 50 years we have had a fall in child mortality .
there is still mystery in one billion .
ue : the purest and the best feeling would be with only goggles .
jc : all right . well we will watch this space . but i have two more questions .
over the years , many people and news reports have blamed the personnel in the institutions for the harm caused to the children , but often , one member of staff is caring for 10 , 20 , and even 40 children .
in moldova , young women raised in institutions are 10 times more likely to be trafficked than their peers , and a russian study found that two years after leaving institutions , young adults , 20 percent of them had a criminal record , 14 percent were involved in prostitution , and 10 percent had taken their own lives .
he &apos;s 35 years old .
despite my pride in ewe culture , the black stars , and my love of ghanaian food , i &apos;ve never had a relationship with the republic of ghana , writ large .
right now , we don &apos;t have that but i &apos;m very sure that we will be able to do that at some stage .
when we started this , i set up the simulation one evening .
this is it from a distance .
we sized them into five compartments . they &apos;re super-efficient .
success is in the doing , and failures are celebrated and analyzed .
when faced with particularly difficult setbacks or complexities , a really interesting behavior emerges : decoration .
in america , our death traditions have come to be chemical embalming , followed by burial at your local cemetery , or , more recently , cremation .
on this particular day , there were 12 bodies laid out in various stages of decomposition .
and my parents were part of a landed property family .
but i joined the indian police service , and then it was a new pattern of policing .
&quot; i want to be at home , doc . &quot;
but should we ?
the change was silent , imperceptible , unless you knew exactly what to look for .
&quot; &quot; he didn &apos;t see anything obvious , and he said he &apos;d have to take the car apart piece by piece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well then , you &apos;d better go to the police , &quot; &quot; i said .
landfill is a different environment .
and this is really hard , because we live in incredibly complex systems .
all these medications , nothing seems to be working .
and the question was , will ugly jerry and ugly tom help their respective , more attractive brothers ?
and we have had some significant successes .
we focused on making the customers aware , because that &apos;s where the change needs to happen .
for the writer stendhal it was the promise of happiness .
&#91; do the unnecessary &#93; a few months ago , hamdi ulukaya , the ceo and founder of the yogurt company chobani , made headlines when he decided to grant stock to all of his 2,000 employees .
oh , there we are . we can save it now .
what you can see over here is tamara , who is holding my phone that &apos;s now plugged in .
more safe , more secure .
it &apos;s peer respect that drives us .
and you think , is it much of a leap ?
so that brings me back to the connection with sweat .
and if we look where the income ends up , this is 100 percent the world &apos;s annual income .
and these were the results of the swedish students .
there &apos;s a young woman named carrie rethlefsen in minnesota .
in the year she had the jeep , she saved 4,500 girls from being cut .
( applause ) thank you all very , very much .
so before the present is the new future , a bit about the past is that i grew up in a family that was multi-everything — multi-racial , multi-cultural , black and white , caribbean , irish-american , german-american .
well , i work in financial markets , not development .
so it &apos;s not obvious how it leads to inflation in the country doing the actual printing unless it leads to a currency depreciation of that country .
they have the social connectedness .
and then we &apos;re starting to create a happy planet .
the default image on the object would probably be a high-resolution earth image .
the idea of it is to make a kind of a traveling show .
the service responded effectively and efficiently , during the unfortunate 26 / 11 mumbai terror attacks .
( laughter ) ca : what &apos;s on your mind ?
&quot; i turn off my desires when ... &quot;
sex is a place you go .
women lie more to protect other people .
it &apos;s woven into the fabric of our daily and our business lives .
and queer is a cultural term , but in this case , it refers to the way that i &apos;m not restricted by gender when it comes to choosing partners .
we &apos;ve learned how to love each other for the long haul .
those are only a few examples of the manufacturing revolution at play .
this means either more labor or more capital or more productivity .
but this , surely , whoever that man is , whatever he &apos;s done , this is cruel and unusual punishment .
( chanting ) jennifer : a soldier walked onto the road , asking where we &apos;d been .
a lot of the kobe beef that you see in the u.s. is not the real thing .
tom cruise supposedly owns this bed .
and women have drawn the short medical straw because it now turns out that many of these drugs don &apos;t work nearly as well on women as they do on men — and the drugs that do work well work so well that they &apos;re actively harmful for women to take .
first , we &apos;ve got to be ready and willing to take experts on and dispense with this notion of them as modern-day apostles .
can we make a little product or a service out of it ? &quot; &quot; so one of the first things we did is this thing called a multimedia platform . we call it a lunch box .
bruno , do you want to join us ? ( cheers ) come along . ( applause ) so , what we &apos;re going to do is that we &apos;re going to measure a few basic parameters on you , including your pulse rate and the amount of oxygen that &apos;s there in your blood .
but the system itself of this city was thriving .
but what &apos;s interesting is you can then broaden the search and actually see interesting things and get a sense of what else is out there .
js : okay . wet hands .
audience : shake . fold .
and i came back and , lo and behold , the little model i &apos;d left behind had been built ten times bigger for public display on site and ... the bridge was built !
( applause ) in 1976 , i was asked to design a children &apos;s memorial museum in a holocaust museum in yad vashem in jerusalem , which you see here the campus .
it &apos;s very remote , it &apos;s very dry and it &apos;s very beautiful .
it &apos;s comparable to the size of the statue of liberty .
what can be done there ?
show us some primary cancer .
antarctica was this planet &apos;s last empty quarter — the blind spot in our expanding vision of the world .
and this is the object of their scrutiny .
we &apos;re living in a culture of jet lag , global travel , 24-hour business , shift work .
in winter , there &apos;s a lot of sleeping going on ; you enjoy your family life inside .
actually , a building is about the most expensive solution you can think of to almost any given problem .
so , as a bottom-of-the-rung architecture graduate , i might expect to earn about 24,000 pounds .
because this good will is unconsciously picked up by other people , and it creates trust , and trust creates a lot of good working relationships .
because what i was looking for was right in front of my eyes — in google , my company .
now it &apos;s time to leave the capsule if you dare .
( music ) amanda palmer ( singing ) : ground control to major tom , ground control to major tom , take your protein pills and put your helmet on .
so you can imagine that if you are a generic company about to decide whether to invest in the development of this product , unless you know that the licenses to these patents are actually going to be available , you will probably choose to do something else .
that can be generic manufacturers .
i was born premature . i was always very small .
so then we broke it down .
and at that moment , everything came into focus for me .
so this means less cutting .
we do the same thing we do with halophytes , and that is : climatic adaptation .
and last , garlic with salicornia , which is what i like .
and you have to remember , these women have survived the worst atrocities of the 20th century .
the world health organization puts the number of chernobyl-related deaths at 4,000 , eventually .
and so we did .
this means there &apos;s practically no deterrent to assault in the united states .
whatever we call it , it &apos;s new , it &apos;s beginning , and i think it &apos;s gong to quite significant .
it &apos;s one of the best known of these new marketplaces where a donor can go straight into a classroom and connect with what a teacher says they need .
so our job is to design for real needs at low friction , because if you don &apos;t , the customer will , anyway .
now , they thought that they had future-proofed this design .
and then it goes into your stomach .
you can make a robot out of jelly .
i &apos;m not sure this project &apos;s going to pan out . &quot; &quot; because he was afraid i was walking into a trap .
and now i was looking at one .
to a wristband on the go .
and so using inform , you can reach out from the screen and manipulate things at a distance .
i almost never show them off because of the issue of the idea of failure .
and he again had to travel to the school to get the information from the teacher , stored it in the only portable memory he has , which is inside his own head , and take it with him , because that is how information was being transported from teacher to student and then used in the world .
of course that means that architecture is political .
i think expression .
and during labor , it has to stretch from this to this .
it was my blood , her blood , our blood .
we took little bots that we had created that spooled a fiber optic .
i learned a lot about science . but i also learned a lot about leadership .
we in the west , we preach the values , the golden light of democracy , that we are the shining example of how it &apos;s done .
now the first round of the voting didn &apos;t bring forth a clear winner — so nobody had achieved the absolute majority — so voting went into a second round three weeks later .
and within a few months after that sea urchin dying , the seaweed started to grow .
it fed the slaves brought to the antilles , the song &quot; &quot; jamaica farewell &quot; &quot; — &quot; &quot; ackee rice salt fish are nice &quot; &quot; — is an emblem of the importance of salt cod from northeastern canada .
haiti allowed us to glimpse into a future of what disaster response might look like in a hyper-connected world where people have access to mobile smart devices .
you can feel the dynamism of this living , breathing community .
the vertical elements are assigned a specific hour of the day .
thank you .
so , music videos are something that i always found interesting , but they always seem to be so reactive .
( applause )
and they call the internet irresponsible .
( applause )
i &apos;ve been shooting time-lapse flowers continuously , non-stop , 24 hours a day , seven days a week , for over 30 years , and to see them move is a dance i &apos;ll never get tired of .
you flip a switch and there is electric light .
she had died hours before of malnutrition and dehydration .
but you will also notice something else about this map .
the world i believe in is one where we &apos;re measured by our ability to overcome adversities , not avoid them .
well , it won &apos;t . it hasn &apos;t , and it &apos;s not going to , because that &apos;s wishful thinking , and wishful thinking isn &apos;t a game plan , it &apos;s procrastination , and we can &apos;t procrastinate on something this important .
there &apos;s a lot of things that we thought , that now , good research , done by african institutions and researchers together with the international researchers , show that that &apos;s not the case .
you can get this chart , free .
and they get up to all sorts of tricks .
and it does something that no other plant that i know of does , and that is that when it flowers — that &apos;s the spadix in the middle there — for a period of about two days , it metabolizes in a way which is rather similar to mammals .
so let me show you how you can get out of that , or at least you can begin the steps towards getting out of that .
that is how we live .
( applause )
except , all of those years i &apos;ve been there on a tourist visa , and i &apos;m fairly sure not many japanese would want to consider me one of them .
and that &apos;s what i hope my comic strip does in a small way .
up until that day , these were the animals that were most common in my life .
indeed , some people say it &apos;s the best idea anybody ever had .
i think that &apos;s the wrong way to think about it .
unfortunately , over the course of the next five , 10 years , other companies had the same idea about drugs that would prevent arrhythmias in people who have had heart attacks .
hi . so , this chap here , he thinks he can tell you the future .
and this was , incidentally , published in 1949 , in the leading textbook of malaria , called &quot; &quot; boyd &apos;s malariology . &quot; &quot; but almost no malaria experts even know it exists .
so , you get this vicious cycle .
now , one recent discovery that has been made by researchers in italy , in parma , by giacomo rizzolatti and his colleagues , is a group of neurons called mirror neurons , which are on the front of the brain in the frontal lobes .
because it &apos;s as though this neuron is adopting the other person &apos;s point of view .
so i continue to think that transportation is the center of the hard universe .
and for me , when i think about our future , and all of those problems that seem incredibly large , the scale is impossible , the urgency is there , peers , inc. provides the speed and scale and the innovation and the creativity that is going to answer these problems .
but you don &apos;t use it for inventory and payroll ; dec is now twice bankrupt . you don &apos;t need personal fabrication in the home to buy what you can buy because you can buy it .
so i started teaching a class , modestly called , &quot; &quot; how to make almost anything . &quot; &quot; and that wasn &apos;t meant to be provocative ; it was just for a few research students .
the women in my family are not exceptions .
we can make a difference , and make a difference , not just for women , but for a global economy that desperately needs their contributions .
and this is how much they agree with the same article that did include a brain image .
the brain scans showed activation in a part of the brain called the insula , a region they say is linked to feelings of love and compassion .
turns out there &apos;s some exceptions to that rule .
back to my account , again exhibiting classic behavior .
and when we first met , one of the things that i remember is that he took me out on a date .
because the world is big .
sr : all right , and here &apos;s the million-dollar experiment .
xl : oh . that &apos;s true . so it looks like , hmm , indeed we need to find a better way to impact the brain at the speed of light .
or this is a project from the itp part of nyu , where they met with this boy who has a severe disability , cannot play with the ps3 , so they built this device that allows the kid to play baseball although he has limited movement capability .
he &apos;s 14 and he anticipated a governmental project by one year . ( applause ) or again , another project where , by analyzing the twitter feed of a family , you can basically point where they are , like in the &quot; &quot; harry potter &quot; &quot; movie .
they understand the structural integrity of a deep avuncular lap , as compared to the shaky arrangement of a neurotic niece in high heels .
but the sound we are greeted with , as the room is bathed in the simulated glow of late-afternoon light , recalls to mind a dirty men &apos;s room in the rear of a greek coffee shop .
by understanding that the atmosphere is made out of several different layers of wind which all have different direction .
so , we went down actually .
he &apos;s probably remembering where his car was in terms of the distances and directions to extended buildings and boundaries around the location where he parked .
and place cells also get this kind of path integration input from a kind of cell called a grid cell .
it was originally designed for people with arthritis , but it was so comfortable , everybody loved it .
i &apos;ll never forget the sound of laughing with my friends . i &apos;ll never forget the sound
there is a solution : resurrection plants .
wheat , rice and maize form 95 percent of our plant food supplies .
but in order to sustain the horizontal line — because these are the projects , these are the systems that we will deliver — we need to also develop the vertical line : system sustenance , high-level education , research and development , industries , technologies , to produce these technologies for application , and finally markets .
that is how you all happen to use and enjoy water .
what i experienced wasn &apos;t virtual reality .
we &apos;ve made 15 films in the last year at our vr company , vrse , and we &apos;ve learned a few things .
if we now make the same observation six months later when the earth has moved to this position in june , we look at that same star and we see it against a different backdrop .
a lot of science isn &apos;t deductive at all , it &apos;s actually inductive .
but of course , life is hard under a military dictatorship , and so for now , this was the only way he could make a living .
nobody would know .
that is needed .
each card box is one billion people .
but that &apos;s obviously not enough .
it was a way of bringing small amounts of water directly to the stalk of the plant .
en : i &apos;d say it &apos;s quite remarkable . i &apos;m getting all these calls from journalists now who are saying to me , &quot; &quot; ethan , it seems like the only two issues advancing politically in america right now are marijuana law reform and gay marriage .
why did we do this ?
so the huli inspired me in that they belong .
they were chosen purely because of their aesthetic , and i &apos;ll talk more about that later .
but the way that humans tell the stories has always evolved with pure , consistent novelty .
it was ubiquitous .
hybrid means it &apos;s something that &apos;s half living and half machine .
plants are even able to communicate — they are extraordinary communicators .
so what am i trying to say ? i &apos;m trying to tell you that there &apos;s a new wave on the continent .
we have opportunities in housing and real estate .
it &apos;s the societies like sweden in the past , like canada today , where there is a centrist politics , where right and left work together , that we encourage supportive attitudes towards globalization .
i am still european .
it &apos;s one sustainable material that they will not run out of .
second , build something extraordinary out of it .
do you wish your child didn &apos;t have down syndrome ?
when i was perhaps six years old , i went to a shoe store with my mother and my brother .
( laughter ) this forest grows as a collective .
so if some nutrition is not available in the vicinity of a tree , these microbes are going to get the nutrition to the tree .
i come from johannesburg , which is a mining town .
let me start by asking you a question , just with a show of hands : who has an iphone ?
they postulate fundamental laws governing them , like the laws of gravity or of quantum mechanics .
at least , i know about my consciousness directly .
during this phase transition , empty space became filled with a substance that we now call higgs field .
too many questions are left unanswered .
we truly believe this is going to be the very first running humanoid robot in the united states . so , stay tuned .
it &apos;s a 12 degrees of freedom robotic arm .
from daphne koller and andrew ng , we learned the concept of &quot; &quot; flipping &quot; &quot; the classroom .
you can watch them any time you want .
they &apos;re easy to be re-adapted .
and those have been linked then with the rather alarming , growing rates of obesity , shown in these maps here , and that obesity has also been triggering great increases in heart disease and diabetes to the point where a child born today has a one-in-three chance of developing diabetes .
all you have to say is , &quot; &quot; make words , &quot; &quot; and they know exactly what to do .
so to him , they were just blocks .
and now , once again , the technology genie is out of the bottle , but this time it &apos;s different .
i &apos;ve tried to study all kinds of organizations to understand what the future might look like , but i &apos;ve been studying nature recently .
we already know climate change is a big problem .
most agricultural emissions come from tropical deforestation , methane from animals and rice fields , and nitrous oxide from over-fertilizing .
so i remember this clearly in the very earliest days of the ipod .
he tells us about the time he visited his friends and he just wanted to take a comfortable shower .
i live in the eastern seaboard of north america when i &apos;m not traveling .
an early coastal migration along the south coast of asia , leaving africa around 60,000 years ago , reaching australia very rapidly , by 50,000 years ago .
what the global delivery model allows is , it allows you to take previously geographically core-located tasks , break them up into parts , send them around the world where the expertise and the cost structure exists , and then specify the means for reintegrating them .
so finally , i want to conclude by showing you the profile of one company , ibm .
well , i think all of you can guess that 12 years on , we &apos;re still nowhere near that goal .
what might explain the difference in the experience of these two nearly identical men ?
when people i knew , you know , people who considered themselves liberal , and everything else , were making fun of jennifer flowers and paula jones .
you know , the toes of the gecko , curling and uncurling like the fingers of michael moschen .
and the cardiac pet scan shown on the lower left , the blue means no blood flow .
that these clogged arteries that you see on the upper left , after only a year become measurably less clogged .
we &apos;ve used up the easy wins from economic growth , and now we &apos;re moving on to harder problems .
can we end hunger , achieve gender equality , halt climate change , all in the next 15 years ?
you know , up until now , if the west got its act together , it could propose and dispose in every corner of the world .
but let &apos;s talk about the shifts of power that are occurring to the world .
but how would that machine then interact with reality ?
so we &apos;re using it to improve the ways that we explore mars .
earwig males have either really large penile appendages or really small ones .
for many decades , biologists actually felt that the hectocotylus was a separate organism altogether .
god forbid that it should have to withstand that .
you label them . you do some high-tech things here and there , some low-tech things here and there .
well to explain that , i &apos;ve got a short video clip to explain the khmer rouge regime during 1975 and 1979 .
and in fact they were forced to work the fields .
( laughter ) and he said , &quot; &quot; dan , what &apos;s wrong with you ?
this is coming from a jewish guy , all right , so that means a lot .
so making the walls is equivalent to taking cars right off the road .
and equity is the key issue here .
pakistan and afghanistan are still so fragile that neither of them have dealt constructively with the problem of pashtun nationalism .
well in light blue , you see the zones or the regions that are at least two-thirds or more dependent on the european union for trade and investment .
on the top you see the one-step players .
we share 98.8 percent of the genes .
i started using a wheelchair 16 years ago when an extended illness changed the way i could access the world .
and the incredibly unexpected thing is that other people seem to see and feel that too .
the children are at the table .
there were so many , i had to cut them .
so we wondered , how can we include men ?
thirty years ago , women were beaten , they were stalked , they were raped , and no one talked about it .
thank you .
all that pink chalky candy has moved to the front of the building and is now being picked into a lot of orders in those pick stations .
so this is a limitation .
i just want not to have any room for doubt — you have to see that for yourself .
so a note for a dating tip here , in some cultures , if you want to please your lover , you call them and hang up . ( laughter ) so why do people leave missed calls ?
occupy was this incredible example of new power , the purest example of new power .
together , we raised four wonderful children .
i grew up in a typical american town near st. louis .
and here are the results of this wonderful project that is the system in venezuela .
we can speak only with music .
it was very important for us to get through to the people .
and there is a gharial looking at us from the river .
transferred to a larger scale — actually a lot larger , with a lot of help — 14,064 bicycle reflectors — a 20-day install .
( applause ) thanks . ( applause )
what will that lead to ?
this is not something that happens far away to people that we don &apos;t know .
i hadn &apos;t heard that before .
the process is old-fashioned .
( beatboxing ) and now , for my next number , i &apos;d like to return to the classics .
yeah ! all right ! most of brisbane &apos;s here . that &apos;s good .
i hear a few yellow . good . so most of you have a brain . ( laughter ) i &apos;m now going to ask you to do the task , but now with a little more challenging task . there are going to be three of them that are blue . don &apos;t move your eyes .
you all know about multitasking . you all have been faulty of multitasking when you &apos;re driving and you pick up your cellphone . bad idea . very bad idea .
they become , in the words of &quot; &quot; the x-files , &quot; &quot; shape-shifters , as they constantly adjust their views in light of what they know will help them to raise money , not on issues one to 10 , but on issues 11 to 1,000 .
now there are three things i want you to see now that i &apos;ve described lesterland .
to the naked eye it just looks like a square smaller than a postage stamp , but under a microscope what you see are thousands of tiny projections that are invisible to the human eye .
so let &apos;s start with the first one , this immunogenicity idea .
i think it &apos;s a problem of completion and delivery , because the fine print said , &quot; &quot; what game-changing ideas and scientific developments would you expect to live to see ? &quot; &quot; so , we have a fulfillment problem .
so , up until now i &apos;ve been talking to you about really large numbers .
now , it could happen much , much later , or sooner , the truth is nobody really knows .
you build up these expert systems , and they were kind of useful for some purposes , but they were very brittle , you couldn &apos;t scale them .
there are different ways to approach evolutionary medicine , and one way is to extract human dna from ancient bones .
and what &apos;s really important about dental calculus is that it fossilizes just like the rest of the skeleton , it &apos;s abundant in quantity before the present day and it &apos;s ubiquitous worldwide .
it was just frightening .
when i first arrived in beautiful zimbabwe , it was difficult to understand that 35 percent of the population is hiv positive .
so i want to suggest that pleasure is deep — and that this isn &apos;t true just for higher level pleasures like art , but even the most seemingly simple pleasures are affected by our beliefs about hidden essences .
so he got joshua bell to take his million dollar violin down to a washington d.c. subway station and stand in the corner and see how much money he would make .
( applause )
and of course , it really doesn &apos;t have that much to do with what went wrong because cancer is a failure of the system .
yeah . cat , can you put leg over that side ? yeah .
it &apos;s a bit of a cross of my arm .
when you &apos;re poor , corruption is not your biggest priority .
and i &apos;m showing you something else with these maps .
but this connection beyond the transaction is exactly what the sharing economy is aiming for .
i was at the front lines of trust breaking .
and she talked about how technology with these new feathers , this new face paint , this punk , the way that we identify with the world , and we made this music video .
and i thought about this concept of , imagine if we could reprogram our own body odor , modify and biologically enhance it , and how would that change the way that we communicate with each other ?
you probably think , well , i don &apos;t know which one you think it is , but i think it &apos;s about feeling beauty .
and finally , the layer that i love , of knowledge .
i have behind this wall a disk drive , a cpu , a graphics card , a memory system .
i began to be very disinterested in computers themselves , so i began to make paintings out of palmpilots .
in the ocean , it &apos;s the rule rather than the exception .
and then when it &apos;s not using it , it actually can roll it down into its head just like the headlights on your lamborghini .
this is part of an exhibition in rotterdam last year .
it &apos;s biologically fascinating , it &apos;s computationally interesting , but it &apos;s also a symbol , a way of engaging with ideas of community , collective behavior , cooperation .
this was eight years ago , some people were more republican back then .
we &apos;re going to drill down a little bit more now , into something called the general social survey .
but instead of accepting his fate , he made a resolution that he would continue his formal education .
scrappers are propelled by the belief that the only person you have full control over is yourself .
and what would you do ? it &apos;s actually a great exercise to really drill down to the things that you feel are important , and really reflect on the world around us .
what it is , it &apos;s a landscape that is an intentional one .
we don &apos;t know what this thing is thinking .
the two humans got it right .
so how is it that one of the strongest indicators of your intelligence is liking this page when the content is totally irrelevant to the attribute that &apos;s being predicted ?
so the result is that we have behavioral , preference , demographic data for hundreds of millions of people , which is unprecedented in history .
it did not happen overnight .
i discovered that , if i worked on a larger scale and with bigger materials , my hand really wouldn &apos;t hurt , and after having gone from a single approach to art , i ended up having an approach to creativity that completely changed my artistic horizons .
post-second world war , the influence of the automobile has really been devastating in a lot of our cities .
but they &apos;re real examples in urbanization and the change that &apos;s occurred in the last number of years , and the heightened sensitivity to the importance of our urban environments as cultural centers .
cochrane , he starts ranting at these germans in this scottish accent — in fluent german , by the way , but in a scottish accent — and explains to them how german culture was the culture that gave schiller and goethe to the world .
now if you ascribe to the god complex , what you do is you find yourself a little god .
now in india , the big inequities are within the state , rather than between the states .
and we came to 1978 , and mao tse tung died , and a new guy turned up from the left .
today the world of globalization is on speed .
yes , i have an advisory position with the u.n.
and then a magnificent thing happened : i left academia and joined the real world of business , and a company was created around my ideas to make new molecules using my method , along the lines of , let ’ s put someone else ’ s money where your mouth is .
but we ’ re not actually doing it by astrology .
that struck a chord , and i said , &quot; &quot; that &apos;s true . &quot; &quot; i went to see a friend of mine , and he made me wait in his apartment in malabar hill on the twentieth floor , which is a really , really upmarket area in mumbai .
you &apos;re a director , you &apos;ve done it for years . &quot; &quot; so i &apos;ve got to get there and be in complete panic .
just to give you an example : this is the exhibition , humble masterpieces , as it was at moma in 2004 .
design can be that , of course , but it can also be this .
we &apos;re all focusing on — this is a statistic from earlier this month in the financial times — we &apos;re all focusing on the luxury economy .
all over the world . and that company was the big german electronics giant siemens .
in the natural cycle of life and death , the creation and destruction that must happen continuously .
only doubts and questioning and uncertainty .
and from these , i can drill into the web page and just launch them again .
and if you drill into that , it &apos;s especially the case for men .
even in the 1930s , my colleagues that were trying to put together an abstract art show had all of these works stopped by the customs officers that decided they were not art .
and so is space , the spatial aspect of games .
and i don &apos;t expect that that &apos;s ever going to change .
in spain , when a performer has done something impossible and magic , &quot; allah , olé , olé , allah , magnificent , bravo , &quot; incomprehensible , there it is — a glimpse of god .
this was a doll called barbie , right ?
no , sweetheart , i said , i &apos;m ready when you are .
was it working to build something , create something , make a work of art ?
now , there are only a few hundred species of corals on the planet , maybe 1,000 .
you have to take 1,000 pictures per second to see this .
no , force is too low . do they do it by electrostatics ?
who here has had surgery ?
nobody wants an operation .
the blue line is an indication of when patterns start to change , and immediately , before we even started putting in clinical interpretation , we can see that the data is speaking to us .
we are thinking big . it &apos;s the right thing to do .
again , don &apos;t answer out loud .
thank you .
we dropped them gently in .
and we practice holism .
this is a provocative question .
it simply means that the category of the human is unstable .
yet the fact that so few people do actually read the koran is precisely why it &apos;s so easy to quote — that is , to misquote .
but all is not lost in translation .
and this is a man who , 10 minutes ago , had just put his teenage son in the ground — something i just can &apos;t even imagine .
and i said to myself , &quot; &quot; god , if it would destroy him to be called a girl , what are we then teaching him about girls ? &quot; &quot; ( applause ) it took me back to a time when i was about 12 years old .
now all those styles of rhythm are all counted in four and then subdivided by three .
what ?
thank you . ( applause )
this is the ancient city of pompeii .
number 12 : if you could wake up tomorrow having gained any one quality or ability , what would it be ?
instead , they wanted to foster interpersonal closeness among college students , by using what aron called &quot; sustained , escalating , reciprocal , personalistic self-disclosure . &quot;
is it maybe protecting its siblings ?
now , i think this is part of what makes parasites so sinister and so compelling .
it &apos;s a rainy , stormy , windy day , and people are getting sick on the boat , and i &apos;m sitting there wearing a wetsuit , and i &apos;m looking out the window in pure terror thinking i &apos;m about to swim to my death .
he &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; but really , just have fun with this . good luck . &quot; &quot; and he dives in , swims off . ok .
and we &apos;ve seen that repeatedly through this conference , not just this year , but in past years .
but this creature that you &apos;ve just seen ultimately adapts , and keeps adapting and adapting .
i , as a cyborg anthropologist , have suddenly said , &quot; &quot; oh , wow . now suddenly we &apos;re a new form of homo sapiens , and look at these fascinating cultures , and look at these curious rituals that everybody &apos;s doing around this technology .
and if you actually lose that information , it means that you suddenly have this loss in your mind , that you suddenly feel like something &apos;s missing , except you aren &apos;t able to see it , so it feels like a very strange emotion .
so we came up with a list of requirements , the &quot; &quot; 10 commandments , &quot; &quot; and they were , in order of ascending difficulty : the first is &quot; &quot; no magic . &quot; &quot; everything that happened on screen had to be very easily understood by a typical viewer .
the little lego car in the beginning of the video references the big , real car near the end of the video .
and i &apos;m pretty much the one who figured it out , because i was a nerd .
so what &apos;s image got do with it ?
i put my flippers on . i could barely part my lips .
( laughter ) and then that wasn &apos;t enough ; she started to flip penguins onto my head .
once you have that capacity , the ability to produce language comes rather naturally and rather freely .
the rock that kanzi is using is extremely hard and ideal for stone tool making , but difficult to handle , requiring great skill .
but our current funeral practices make the situation much worse .
says we have 219 toxic pollutants in our bodies , and this includes preservatives , pesticides and heavy metals like lead and mercury .
this pair , in fact , these currently cost about 19 dollars .
what we &apos;ve done is to set up the center for vision in the developing world here in the university .
that actually removes about 95 percent of the carbon black , that stuff that , with ozone , is responsible for about half of global warming &apos;s effects , because it changes , it settles on the snow , it changes the reflectors , it changes the transmission qualities of the atmosphere .
what they are is an addition of tadpoles that are named after a local bureaucrat whose decisions affect your water quality .
now we just wait for a few seconds for the molecules to spread inside the bottle .
so that &apos;s how those images were made .
and as science offers greater power and promise , the downside gets scarier too .
and indeed , future evolution will happen much faster , on a technological timescale , not a natural selection timescale .
( laughter ) so , that &apos;s going to look pretty shabby now .
this is the first time that i can remember , where if you get a letter from the bank manager about a loan , you don &apos;t know if you &apos;re borrowing money from him , or if he &apos;s borrowing money from you .
we found her one , we got her there , and we took care of her and watched over her family , because it was necessary .
you know , what i do is write for children , and i &apos;m probably america &apos;s most widely read children &apos;s author , in fact .
before i came down here , i looked it up on openstreetmap the openstreetmap &apos;s a map , but it &apos;s also a wiki .
it &apos;s not just a whole lot of other plants .
i think we all kind of stand and watch .
and then , you know when a pet has an operation and they shave a bit of the skin and get rid of the fur — in order to get you to go into the seed cathedral , in effect , we &apos;ve shaved it .
if that is true , advertising is still one of the most powerful tools of change that we have available .
we asked them , &quot; &quot; can you send guerrillas a message ? &quot; &quot; we collected over 6,000 messages .
around 17 to 20 years , i became , myself , a poacher .
i suspect a lot of people here have the same question i have .
so what do i plan to leave for my son ?
i plan to publish my own notebook .
so this is just a picture — a micrograph of your skin .
and then as the cells grow , they &apos;re all releasing that molecule into the environment , so there &apos;s lots of molecule there .
and we are considered less .
it &apos;s amazing how it connects us all ! it &apos;s about connection .
she is meant to have the power to look inside people and see the good and bad in everyone .
they have different interests . they have divergent values .
it &apos;s kind of boring , but i &apos;ll just tell you a little bit about my family . i &apos;m one of 11 brothers and sisters from lakefield , ontario , an hour and a half northeast of toronto , and we grew up on a farm .
( music ) ( laughter ) nm : uh , sure .
it &apos;s just a little server control and i made a little video going : &quot; hi , my name &apos;s furby , and i &apos;m good , &quot; you know , and then i &apos;d reach my hand .
and then more sculpting , and then more sculpting , and then more sculpting , and then more sculpting .
it didn &apos;t work .
we &apos;re being corrected , and the primary policemen are women , because we are the carriers of the tradition .
that &apos;s 20 percent of the budget , and that presents a more difficult issue .
each of those times , we were on the verge of complete collapse .
what these pictures demonstrate is that we do feel the pain of others , however distantly .
there is a story about olof palme , the swedish prime minister , going to see ronald reagan in america in the 1980s .
now , race is one of those topics in america that makes people extraordinarily uncomfortable .
and one day my coach had me do a drill where i had to swim to one end of a 25-meter pool without taking a breath .
it seems to be magic .
amazing channel .
and i haven &apos;t the slightest idea of what it does or what it &apos;s good for , but i want it .
but that &apos;s reflective design as well .
before founding ideo , david said that what he wanted to do was to form a company where all the employees are my best friends .
you might know it as , &quot; &quot; how many uses can you find for a paper clip ? &quot; &quot; it ’ s basically the same thing as the 30 circles thing that i just had you do .
imagine personalized clothes that fit exactly to your measurements .
( to audience ) thank you , guys .
and there is a bright star called deneb . so let &apos;s select deneb .
there is portable ones . there is large display ones .
and if our fates are intertwined , then we believe that it is good karma , it is good fortune .
they went through a lot to get here .
i didn &apos;t see him graduate , and now you &apos;re going to college .
am : you know , i live this every day now .
but the simple act of kindness from a complete stranger will unstitch you . &quot; &quot; the old women in my father &apos;s village , after this war had happened , memorized the names of every dead person , and they would sing these dirges , made up of these names .
so , i was about nine , and my uncle had just come back from germany , and we had the catholic priest over , my mother was entertaining him with tea .
( laughter ) but , i think it &apos;s a really fun and wonderful thing .
1,860 — am i good ?
that was a black hole for humor , and correctly so .
( laughter ) that &apos;s sort of an exaggeration of what i do .
so why ?
but so too can our mind .
why ? because they looked at the curve and said , if the population keeps growing at this rate , to move the population of new york around , they would have needed six million horses , and the manure created by six million horses would be impossible to deal with .
thank you . ( applause )
how do you characterize the american citizen &apos;s right to privacy ?
what i actually said , in response to a question about , would you entertain any discussions of mitigating action against snowden , i said , yeah , it &apos;s worth a conversation .
and i discovered another fact , which to me was more astonishing almost for the fact that i hadn &apos;t known it before at the age of 42 , 43 .
i &apos;d really loved being on board kendal .
they have the problems , we have the solutions . &quot; &quot; number two .
and i was terrified and in pain , and i would stop working .
so , if there is something you should fear , it &apos;s that you &apos;re not keeping your eye on the ball .
silicon valley did . and that &apos;s why they say that silicon valley has been powered by ics .
thanks a lot .
there are lots of people who actually share the same dream .
and every now and then they &apos;d chide you , when they got frustrated that you couldn &apos;t really keep up with half of the technical things they &apos;re banging on about all the time .
( music : &quot; &quot; la di da di &quot; &quot; by doug e. fresh &amp; slick rick ) that &apos;s &quot; &quot; la di da di &quot; &quot; and it &apos;s the fifth-most sampled song of all time .
and this to me is an extreme case of the power of emotion , of graphic design , even though , in fact , was a very generic poster at the time .
and when i was teaching , i used to always ask the students , what &apos;s the definition of a good job ?
now what if we could achieve that historic two-percent growth for the next 70 years ?
that &apos;s an open buggy . it doesn &apos;t have heating .
maybe those reasons , or depending on where you are , cadavers may not be easily available .
i &apos;m going to do some surgery here .
because something did .
and so the first step is to realize that we can do this together , and that there is no &quot; &quot; us &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; them . &quot; &quot; thank you very much . ( applause )
it wasn &apos;t going to be written down . it was no news .
it becomes something magically large .
that guy could be a problem .
that &apos;s very nice about them .
then what we do is we increase the velocity a little bit .
and she said they hadn &apos;t .
the population growth in nigeria , and especially in these areas like makoko , are painful reminders of how out of control things really are .
while to most of us , living amongst these piles and piles of garbage may seem totally uninhabitable , to those in the zabbaleen , this is just a different type of normal .
wow , it &apos;s almost a full house .
( applause )
why should the squares of one , one , two , three , five and eight add up to eight times 13 ?
let &apos;s look at that last equation .
today , 16 african countries and growing have sovereign country ratings . what does this mean ?
the backbone of making investment decisions for global holders of capital .
so it &apos;s not simply a western phenomenon .
dysmorphophobia is a perversion of this where people who may be very good looking regard themselves as hideously ugly and are constantly seeking surgery to correct their facial appearance .
( laughter ) well , i decided to do a little experiment with my 16-year old son .
we were flummoxed by this .
thank you . ( applause ) ( applause )
and if i could communicate just one thing to remi and to sam and to you , it would be that you don &apos;t have to be normal .
on the other hand , we &apos;re working with berkshire hathaway , warren buffett and shaw carpet , the largest carpet company in the world .
( laughter ) so , we &apos;re looking at the same criteria as most people — you know , can i afford it ?
but we were all so nervous .
so if i can save one of the young girls , and avoid that they get married and suffer as much as i did , well this is something good .
at 25 , when i was walking home one evening , two men on a motorcycle attacked me .
i did all of it . in fact , that was what everyone was doing two years ago .
ninety percent of modern war casualties are civilians .
it is a chess game .
we often look to technology as the answer , but as an artist and designer , i like to ask , but what is the question ?
should we do it for profit , for utility ?
and compared to the tens of thousands of dollars for a traditional eeg system , this headset only costs a few hundred dollars .
the technology can also be applied to real world applications — in this example , a smart home .
they went from retreating to the nurse &apos;s station to discuss the various states and needs of patients , to developing a system that happened on the ward in front of patients , using a simple software tool .
it &apos;s a woodworking machine , or at least a piece of one , and my task was to make this thing a little bit more modern , a little bit easier to use .
i could feel the wind against my face and the beat of my racing heart as if it were happening in that very moment .
that &apos;s the question that changed my life forever .
that &apos;s going to go to 70 percent in 2050 .
it would lead to changing deserts , changing rivers , changing patterns of hurricanes , changing sea levels , hundreds of millions of people , perhaps billions of people who would have to move , and if we &apos;ve learned anything from history , that means severe and extended conflict .
their heart is in the right place , like ratan tata .
and therefore , each component had to have a dual functionality .
in fact , the founders of our company , chris , robbie and i , we met over 15 years ago at the united nations when they were hosting a conference about exactly that question : how do you use satellites to help humanity ?
so , what &apos;s standing in our way ?
there is no &quot; &quot; find terrorist &quot; &quot; button , and the more data we integrate from a vast variety of sources across a wide variety of data formats from very disparate systems , the less effective data mining can be .
we &apos;re more than 50 years into licklider &apos;s vision for the future , and the data suggests that we should be quite excited about tackling this century &apos;s hardest problems , man and machine in cooperation together .
across the americas , from the us and mexico to colombia and uruguay , change is in the air .
what i &apos;ve learned over the last years is that you need coalitions of the willing and of the unwilling to make change .
